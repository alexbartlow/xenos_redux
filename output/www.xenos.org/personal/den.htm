We're all involved\n           in this wonderful Christian community, growing together as God uses\n          us \n        to bless others. Holly serves as Director of <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/index.htm\">Missions\n         Mobilization</a>, and Jess and her husband, Ryan  lead  a cluster of home churches\n          in the adult ministry.\n        Joe and Bret both lead home churches in the <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/college/index.htm\">College Ministry</a> and in the\n         high school ministry.</p>\n      <p>I love hanging around with the hundreds of excited and \n        motivated Christian servants in our group, and sharing the love of God \n        with each other and those outside the church. </p>\n      <p>I've been here since 1970 when I was a sophomore in college.\n           I had recently come to faith in Christ and left the party lifestyle\n          to \n        follow Him. My brother and I, with some friends, started a Bible study\n           in our rooming house because we couldn't find a place to bring our\n          friends \n        where they would feel comfortable. Our little study has now grown into\n          a church of almost 5,000 people, made up of nearly 300 house churches in central Ohio. Unlike a lot of house church networks, we have an eldership and large, city-wide meetings too. </p>\n      <p>I'm still here teaching the Bible\n        \n        and training leaders of home groups. Cooking and hunting wild mushrooms\n        are my main hobbies. </p>\n      <p>Apart from my role as an elder and member of the management \n        team, I serve in our <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/ct/ct.htm\">Central Teachings</a> \n        and in the <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/college/index.htm\">College outreach</a>. \n        I teach a <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/index.htm\">course on leadership</a> <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/index.htm\"></a> on Wednesday \n      evenings. </p>\n      <p>I'm also an author, and these are my books. You can see pictures and\n    descriptions of them, and download FREE Study Guides and/or discounts on these pages:\n    </p><dl>\n      <dir>\n        <li><i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Satan-His-Kingdom-Bible-Matters/dp/0764206494\"><strong>Satan and his Kingdom</strong></a> </i> (Bethany House, 2009), I'm tired of extremist books on Satan. This one answers some key quesitons with a new take, like \"Why did Satan help kill Jesus?\" Learn why a peacetime mentality is ruining the quality of church life in America. </li>\n\t\t<li><i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Organic-Discipleship-Mentoring-Spiritual-Leadership/dp/0983668108\"><strong>Organic Disciplemaking</strong></a> </i> (Touch Publications, 2006), is the supreme explanation for how we do ministry at Xenos. I've been told by many other pastors that there is nothing like it in America. I wonder why not? Or is that even true? You be the judge. </li>\n        <li><i><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/fms.htm\"><strong>Christianity: The Faith That Makes Sense</strong></a></i> (Tyndale House Publishers, 1992), is a tool used in witnessing. The fourth printing is\n          just hitting the shelves (winter, 1997), and it's a completely new edition, specially\n          rewritten with postmodern culture in view.</li>\n        <li><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/summns.htm\"><strong><i>The Summons</i></strong>,</a> (NavPress)\n            won the\n          <i>Campus Life</i> Book of the Year Contest \"Award of Merit\" for\n          1994. You can now get the entire book from this site <u>FOR FREE!</u></li>\n        <li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/1590670035\"><strong><i>Walking in Victory:\n                Experiencing the Power of Your Identity in Christ</i></strong>,</a> (NavPress,\n                Xenos) is a study of spiritual growth based on Romans 5-8.</li>\n          <li><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/myth.htm\"><strong><i>Spiritual Relationships \n            That Last</i></strong></a> (Xenos Publishing) is about how to prepare for, \n            and build, a Christ-centered marriage. This books takes an unusual \n            line I think you will find interesting.

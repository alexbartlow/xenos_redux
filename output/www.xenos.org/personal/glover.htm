Thanks for visiting my page.</p>\n\t\t\t<p> I serve as coordinator of our  <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/missions.htm\">Missions Division</a>. I'm also a member of the Xenos Management Team and since 2005 have served as Executive Director of <a href=\"http://urbanconcern.org\">Urban Concern</a>.  My wife Tracy and I  lead an adult home group. We have 2 children, Lindsey and Tyler.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Prior to coming on staff with Xenos Christian Fellowship I worked  as a systems engineer for 11 years. As you can imagine, becoming a school superintendent and missions director was quite a career change for my family and me. We are extremely grateful and consider it a privilege to be in full-time Christian work. However, it was not always this way. </p>\n\t\t\t<p>After college I pursued my career while putting my relationship with Christ and wife on the back-burner. This lead to a life of frustration and lack of fulfillment. It was particularly bad because, I was a Christian and I knew I was living a compromised life. In 1984 I came to Xenos where we got involved in a home Bible study. Through the Holy Spirit's conviction and the involvement of close friends in the Body of Christ I gave my whole life to Christ. I decided to put Christ first in my life and live according to His plan and priorities. The best decision I've ever made! </p>\n\t\t\t<p>I thank God he rescued me from a life of compromise and lack of fulfillment. </p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n      </div> \n    </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/gloverfamily.jpg","title":"Xenos Christian Fellowship","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/personal/glover.htm"}

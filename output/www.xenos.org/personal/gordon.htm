In 1998, I made a big career change  and cut my medical practice to part-time (about 10 hours per week) so I could  involve myself more in ministry. </p>\n\n<p>If 25 years ago you'd  told me I'd be involved in Christian ministry, I would have thought you were  crazy! I was interested only in a medical career and everything that goes with  it. Thanks to the efforts of one of my medical school classmates, I became a  Christian in April of 1982. I began learning the Bible through Xenos' teaching  ministry and my view on life priorities changed. God showed me that he had real<em>  purpose </em>for  me as I began to set selfish priorities aside in favor of serving him.</p>\n<p>Laura and I were married in July of 1984.  We have a son, and two daughters. They are all grown and learning and growing  in their own ways. Our family is a consistent source of satisfaction and  challenge. Laura serves as a Home Group Consultant in the Xenos<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/aboutxenos/organization.htm\"> Adult Ministries </a>Division,  teaches a women's Bible study, and volunteers at Harambee Christian School.  We both practice personal discipleship. </p>\n<p>I began serving on the  Xenos board of elders in 1989. I'm now the pastor of our first Sunday Morning  Central Teaching that meets in the Caf&#xE9;. I teach classes in our adult education  program. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/personal/graphics/ADeathProlonged_cov.jpg\" alt=\"A Death Prolonged\" width=\"150\" hspace=\"5\" border=\"1\">I continue to practice  medicine at Grant Medical Center. I get  to teach internal medicine to medical students and family medicine  residents. Through that work I&#x2019;ve become  quite concerned about the needless suffering that so many elderly people endure  due to the fact that they have not discussed their end-of-life issues in  advance. I published a short novel that  tackles these tough issues. <em><a href=\"http://www.adeathprolonged.com/\">A  Death Prolonged</a></em> has helped many people already, and Jane Brody featured  it in her <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/18/health/18brod.html?_r=2&amp;ref=health\">August  17, 2009 column</a> in the New York Times.  I believe this is a major social injustice and hope that others, within  and outside the church, will band together to fight for change.</p>\n<p>I am active in the work of Urban Concern and  have a deep concern for the issue of global poverty. I spent the month of  August 2009 with my wife and daughter, serving in a medical clinic in  Cambodia. My personal story is explored in greater detail in <em><a href=\"http://clemboyd.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=44&amp;Itemid=33\">What Does God  Want Me to Do? </a></em>by Clem Boyd (2008), a Focus on the Family  Recommended book.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n      </div> \n    </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/personal/graphics/ADeathProlonged_cov.jpg","title":"Xenos Christian Fellowship","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/personal/gordon.htm"}

I am an elder and currently serve in several roles, \n  including Xenos Secretary to the Elders &amp; Management Team, and the Sr. Sphere \n  Leader for our Saturday Central Teaching within our  <u><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/aboutxenos/organization.htm\">Adult \n  Ministries Division</a></u>,where I help oversee our <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/ct/ct.htm\">Central \n  Teachings</a>. I also teach our quarterly orientation reception, All About Xenos. \n  </p>\n<p>In prior years, I served as Division \n  Coordinator of Quality Initiatives which involved working on a number of process \n  improvement projects, including the compilation of key management indicators \n  and annual reporting templates for the church. </p>\n<p>I came to Xenos with 15 \n  years of executive management experience in the high-tech computer and network \n  services industry, including eight years with CompuServe. I have an MBA from \n  the University  of Michigan \n   and a B.S. from Miami University \n   in English. God has used my background in sales, marketing, \n  development and communications to prepare me for the challenges of a rapidly \n  growing church like Xenos. </p>\n<p>I came to Christ in my twenties, but \n  it wasn't until my three-year-old son died in 1990 that I pursued learning about \n  a relationship and walk with Christ as my Lord. God has used my son's life to \n  help heal me and my wife, Connie, and equip us to minister to others who are \n  hurting. We have come to a deep understanding of God's grace and faith in his \n  Word. For seven years, we helped lead a college ministry that met in our house, \n  working under Lead Pastor, <u>Gary DeLashmutt </u>. \n  In 1998 we helped lead out our first home church plant, which grew and planted \n  in 2000 and again in 2002. Connie also serves on staff working with me as a \n  sphere leader to help oversee the home groups that attend our Saturday Central \n  Teaching. </p>\n<p> I also had the privilege of co-leading a \n\n\njr. high school cell for my second son, who is now attending college. We also have a daughter who is enrolled in <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/xcs/index.htm\">Xenos Christian Schools </a>.</p>\n<p>Hey!

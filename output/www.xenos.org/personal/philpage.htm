As a student I wandered around looking for fellowship for half a dozen years until I found Xenos and seized the opportunity to really learn and grow here. Then in 1979, I moved into what we call a \"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/minhse.htm\">ministry \n        house</a>\" with some other Christian guys in Xenos, completed our theology classes, and started co-leading a home group of my own.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Since 1991 I've been working full time at Xenos, and I'm currently Support Services division coordinator overseeing <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/evang.htm\">external relations</a>, <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/evang.htm\"> communications</a>, <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/evang.htm\"> evangelism impact ministries</a>, <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/counseling/counsdpt.htm\">counseling</a>, large meeting administration and<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/steam.htm\"> Servant Team </a> administration. Part of my work with Xenos is to oversee several home churches as a Sphere Leader, and I help oversee some of the music functions here. I have a B. A. in Applied Communications, as well as completing Biblical course work with Southwestern Assemblies of God College, and course work in Music Theory and Composition. I've been leading my own home churches in Xenos since the early '80s with my wife Renee.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>We have two grown sons (Josh and John), who are both enjoying leading home groups in Xenos.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>I'm a classically trained musician, and record and play professionally in a traditional Irish band with my son Josh, called The Drowsy Lads.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n      </div> \n    </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Xenos Christian Fellowship","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/personal/philpage.htm"}

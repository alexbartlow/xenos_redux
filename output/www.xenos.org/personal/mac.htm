My wife, Jayne Ann; two sons, John IV and Daniel; and my daughter, Keira, all live in Westerville, Ohio. Jayne Ann is a co-leader with me in our college ministry, homemaker and director with the children's Oasis program at Xenos. John and his wife Andrea serve in the adult ministry,  Daniel and his wife Emily lead in the college ministry and Keira attends OSU and leads in the college ministry.  We are fortunate to be able to serve within the same church--ministering to our friends, neighbors and those we haven't met yet.\n\t\t\t  </p>\n\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t<p>In 1977, I began a career in financial consulting. Today I am the owner of J.H. McKewen III &amp; Associates LLC, an investment management firm located in Worthington, Ohio. Attending Ohio State University (Columbus) and Wright State University (Dayton), I pursued a minor degree emphasis in business and gained experience working through international banking, corporate and personal lending, bank trust departments, and various insurance and investment related positions. This background helps in the GIFT Ministry (Generous Investments in Future Treasures) associated in Xenos. I maintain full-time working hours in my business and face the same challenges as all other small self-employed business owners. It has been faith-building and immensely gratifying to experience God's promises and his daily provision. </p>\n            <p>Currently, I serve with the GIFT Ministry Team  as a team leader and counselor to individuals and businesses. Our goal is to teach God's perspective as it relates to money, personal wealth, the world system and God's real promises for the Christian life. The ministry does this through classes, seminars and individual counseling. Additionally, I serve as elder, board member of Urban Concern and Xenos Christian Schools.\n              </p>\n              \n            <p>Please drop me a note with \n              your <a href=\"mailto:McKewenJ@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">questions or \n                comments</a>. I will do my best to respond as quickly as possible.</p>\n            \n            <p>Mac</p>\n            \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n      </div> \n    </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/mckewen.jpg","title":"Xenos Christian Fellowship","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/personal/mac.htm"}

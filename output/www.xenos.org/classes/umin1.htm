You can either select sections to teach over a short period \n        (as little as 4 to 5 weeks) or you can go into depth on all the subjects, \n        which will take nearly 20 weeks of study (40 weeks, if you meet biweekly).</p>\n      \n<p>The subjects are marked Level 1, 2 or 3 depending on how vital we think that \n  subject is. If you decide to delete some studies, we suggest you delete the \n  level 3 subjects first, and then level 2 and so on. If you have the time, you \n  should consider covering all the material.</p>\n      <p>When preparing to teach, be sure to compare the teacher's manual with \n        the workbook to see which part your people have.

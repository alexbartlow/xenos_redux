Satan has little more work \n          to do once he gets a leadership team in conflict.Workers must therefore \n          take seriously Paul's commands to be effective peacemakers.Unless we understand conflict, learn how to resolve conflict \n          with our fellow workers, and teach others how to do this, our home groups \n          will likely fail in their mission of effective evangelism and discipleship.</h4>\n        <h3 class=\"LevelC\">General observations on conflict</h3>\n        <h4 class=\"LevelB\">Definition: Conflict is a difference in opinion or purpose \n          that frustrates someone's goals or desires.</h4>\n        <h4 class=\"LevelB\">Conflict is unavoidable, especially since Christianity \n          is ABOUT community.In a fallen \n          world, the only way to avoid conflict is to avoid interaction with other \n          people!It is both unbiblical and na&#xEF;ve to be shocked \n          by conflict in the church.</h4>\n        <h4 class=\"LevelB\">Conflict is often a sign of health.Consider the following reasons why this is the \n          case.</h4>\n      </p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p class=\"Section1\"> \n          <h4 class=\"LevelC\"> Conflict over how to best achieve our mission demonstrates \n            spiritual commitment and vitality.Groups that have no conflict over this issue are apathetic.</h4>\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"Section1\"> \n          <h4 class=\"LevelC\">Conflict is important in creating the tension necessary \n            for creative problem-solving and accelerated learning.God often uses the pressure of conflict to further \n            his purposes (see Acts 6:1-7; 15:1-31; <time>15:36</time>-40).</h4>\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"Section1\"> \n          <h4 class=\"LevelC\">When we work through conflict successfully, our relationships \n            are usually deepened and strengthened.Conversely, relationships that avoid conflict \n            remain superficial at best, ripe for division at worst.</h4>\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"Section1\"> \n          <h4 class=\"LevelC\">Conflict can expose sinful attitudes that require firm \n            discipline.God sometimes uses \n            conflict to cleanse the church of ungodly people (see 1&#xA0;Corinthians \n            11:18-19)</h4>\n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"Section1\"> \n        <h4 class=\"LevelB\">Healthy vs. unhealthy conflict</h4>\n      </p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p class=\"Section1\"> \n          <h4 class=\"LevelC\">The root issue that distinguishes healthy conflict \n            from unhealthy conflict is our heart attitude and motivation.</h4>\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"Section1\"> \n          <h4 class=\"LevelD\">Unhealthy: James <time>3:13</time>-4:2 \n            says that unhealthy conflict is the result of sinful lusts, including \n            bitterness, selfish ambition, and envy/jealousy.</h4>\n        </p>\n        <h4 class=\"LevelD\">Healthy: Conversely, healthy conflict is motivated by \n          a humble desire to glorify God and serve others (see Mark <time>10:40-45; Luke&#xA0;14:6-11; 1&#xA0;Peter&#xA0;5:2-6).In light of this fact, the following contrasts \n          are helpful in distinguishing healthy conflict from unhealthy conflict.</time></h4>\n        <p class=\"Section1\"> \n          <h4 class=\"LevelD\"><i>Issues-oriented \n            vs. sin-driven: </i>An issues-oriented conflict focuses on the problem \n            at hand and how to solve it redemptively.A sin-driven conflict is rooted in hurt feelings or unrighteous \n            ambitions.These two kinds of conflict are often inter-related.</h4>\n        </p>\n        <blockquote> \n          <p class=\"Section1\"> \n            <h4 class=\"LevelE\">Conflict over issues may give rise to sin-driven \n              conflict.I may allow my pride to be pricked because I \n              didn&#x92;t get my way.I \n              may choose to harbor bitterness over real or perceived harshness \n              in how others disagreed with me.I may choose to be threatened because others disagreed with \n              my decision.I may give way \n              to suspicion or bitterness because my leaders did not nominate me \n              for Servant Team.</h4>\n          </p>\n          <p class=\"Section1\"> \n            <h4 class=\"LevelE\">But sin-driven conflicts often disguise themselves \n              as issue-oriented conflicts.Rather \n              than admit that I am embittered or rivalrous, I may continue to \n              bring up criticisms over the quality of the teaching, the character \n              weakness of a leader, etc.The tip-off that this is actually a sin-driven \n              conflict is that as fast as one issue is resolved, another one pops \n              up.</h4>\n          </p>\n        </blockquote>\n

\n          <p class=\"Section1\"> \n            <h4>Cooperation encourages perception of similarity of attitudes, \n              which leads to the tendency to avoid coercion and use

     <h4 class=\"LevelE\">Home group leaders and workers should be involved \n              in cooperative linkage.Unfortunately, \n              we sometimes discover that a competitive attitude has taken hold, \n              thereby bringing in a different dynamic in conflict.For example, workers may have conflict over who should follow \n              up a new person in the home group.In a cooperative linkage, the keys to resolve this conflict \n              may include what will be best for the new person, where the new \n              person wants to go, which ministry spheres need bolstered, etc.In a competitive linkage, the desire to build one's own kingdom \n              is the bottom line.</h4>\n          </p>\n        </blockquote>\n        <p class=\"Section1\"> \n

What’s the difference \n        between that and marrying one? How should you approach it? Why is she \n        doing this?</h4>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelB0\">  That guy would have incredible impact on \n        the Lord’s work if he wasn’t so sold out to his career!  How \n        should we approach this?</h4>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelB0\">  I can’t believe she actually won’t \n        talk to her husband for hours, sometimes days when she is upset with him.  \n        This is a theme in her relationships. I wonder how we can help?</h4>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelB0\">  That guy’s temper problem has everyone \n        walking on eggshells around him. He knows it is wrong, why doesn’t \n        he just stop it?  He must not be truly repentant.</h4>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelB0\"> These are commonplace scenarios in the life of a Christian \n        worker.  It is a tremendous source of fulfillment to be used by God to \n        help others work through issues and change from the inside out.  But it \n        can also be quite frightening to have a level of responsibility that impacts \n        people’s marriage, personal lives, work situations, etc.  Maybe we \n        should just leave this to the professional…</h4>\n      <h3 class=\"LevelA0\">All Christian workers should be able to do pastoral counseling!</h3>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelB0\">This is in sharp contrast to the secular professional \n        model that has captured the evangelical church (the new clergy/priesthood) \n        which almost entirely refers counseling needs to professionals.  </h4>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelC0\">This abdication also allows non-Christian thinking to \n        seep into the church (see 3 secular models discussion below).</h4>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelC0\">Have we have succumbed to this in Xenos to the extent \n        that most counseling is referred out to Xenos staff counselors or other \n        Christian counselors?</h4>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelB0\"> Are there other reasons perhaps you have steered clear \n        of this? </h4>\n      <blockquote> \n        <h4 class=\"LevelC0\">EG. feel inadequately equipped; don’t have time \n          (other ministry responsibilities – teacher: exhort we must make \n          time); haven’t experienced the same problem so don’t know \n          how to handle this.</h4>\n      </blockquote>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelC0\">We aren’t adequate but God is and has provided the \n        resources for us to be used by him to help people grow.</h4>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelB0\">The biblical basis for this thesis – all Christian \n        workers should be able to do pastoral counseling:</h4>\n      <blockquote> \n        <h4 class=\"LevelC0\"> <b>1.</b> The New Testament words for counseling are addressed to \n          <i>all</i> Christians.  The words below provide some sense of what Christian \n          pastoral counseling involves--namely, personal and practical application \n          of God's Word to individuals.  They are listed in a continuum from the \n          least confrontive to the most confrontive.</h4>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelD0\"><i>Parakaleo</i> (107 times in New Testament): encourage, \n          comfort, exhort</h5>\n        <blockquote> \n          <h5>See 1 Thessalonians <time>5:11</time> \n            and Hebrews <time>10:25</time> \n            for this as an important ministry all Christians.</h5>\n        </blockquote>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelD0\"><i>Didasko</i>: (97 times in New Testament) teach, instruct \n          (formally or informally)</h5>\n        <blockquote> \n          <h5 class=\"LevelE0\">See Colossians <time>3:16</time> \n            for this as an important ministry all Christians.</h5>\n        </blockquote>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelD0\"><i>Noutheteo</i> (11 times in New Testament): admonish; \n          counsel</h5>\n        <blockquote> \n          <h5 class=\"LevelE0\">See Romans <time>15:14</time> \n            and Colossians <time>3:16</time> \n            for this as an important ministry all Christians.</h5>\n        </blockquote>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelD0\"><i>Elencho</i> (17 times in New Testament): reprove, \n          expose, convict, refute</h5>\n        <blockquote> \n          <h5 class=\"LevelE0\">See 2 Timothy 4:2 for this as an important ministry \n            all Christian workers.</h5>\n        </blockquote>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelD0\"><i>Epitimao</i>: (33 times in New Testament) rebuke, \n          warn, tell sternly</h5>\n        <blockquote> \n          <h5 class=\"LevelE0\">See 2 Timothy 4:2 for this as an important ministry \n            all Christian workers.</h5>\n        </blockquote>\n        <h4 class=\"LevelC0\"> <b>2.</b> The main goal of New Testament counseling is sanctification, \n          which all Christian workers should be facilitating (especially within \n          fellowship and discipleship relationships). Unfortunately many view \n          “counseling” only as a special arrangement, in a formal setting, \n          as well as by a professional. In essence, when we disciple, we are offering \n          counsel.</h4>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelD0\">See Galatians 6:1, where Paul calls on all \"spiritual\" \n          Christians to restore Christians from sin to usefulness in the church.</h5>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelD0\">See 1 Timothy 1:5, where Paul says that the goal \n          of all Christian workers' ministry is \"love from a pure heart, \n          a good conscience and a sincere faith\"--synonyms for spiritual \n          maturity.</h5>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelD0\">See Colossians 1:28, where Paul cites himself as \n          an example to be followed by other Christians.  The goal of such counseling \n          is to present every person complete/mature in Christ.</h5>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelD0\">See Paul's example again in 1 Thessalonians 2:8-10, \n          where he says the goal is for them to walk in a manner worthy of God's \n          kingdom.</h5>\n        <h4 class=\"LevelC0\"> <b>3.</b> The main context for New Testament counseling is Christian \n          community, in which all Christians should be active participants (CONTRA: \n          professional, individualistic model).</h4>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelD0\">See Ephesians 4:15,16, which calls on all Christians \n          to speak the truth in love in the context of Body-life so we can grow \n          to maturity.</h5>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelD0\">See also notes on <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu3_bodylife.htm\">normative \n          involvement in the Body of Christ</a> from Christian Principles class.</h5>\n      </blockquote>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelB0\">NOTE: There is a place for specially gifted pastoral counseling \n        and professional counseling (mental illness or more severe damage). But: \n      </h4>\n      <blockquote> \n        <h5 class=\"LevelC0\">  It should be the exception, not the norm.</h5>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelC0\">  Gifted pastoral counselors should work \n          hard to equip other Christian workers (including others gifted in this \n          area) in counseling, rather than just do it all themselves.</h5>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelC0\">  Other Christian friends should usually \n          be involved in this by accompanying them to the counseling session.  \n          Wouldn’t the counselor get a much more objective picture of what’s \n          going on?  Wouldn’t the counselor be freed from having to be the \n          person’s support system to do what he/she is supposed to do – \n          give expert insight and direction?  Wouldn’t the counselee(s) get \n          more support and accountability from their friends?  The very fact that \n          this suggestion seems bizarre to many Christians (both counselees and \n          counselors) shows how much we have capitulated to this secular model.</h5>\n      </blockquote>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelB0\">Summary</h4>\n      <blockquote> \n        <h5 class=\"LevelC0\">Who does this?

It IS our business if we are workers for \n          Jesus Christ who calls on us to help bring his guidance into these relationships? \n          Are we encouragers but unwilling to address problems? Do we address \n          problems but in essence just call on them to change – “stop \n          doing…” “start doing…” – not offering \n          direction for the person to tap into God’s transforming power? \n          Do we believe we must have all the answers before we broach an issue? \n          We will never have all the answers, but God does. He calls on us to \n          invest on this level.</h5>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelC0\">This is where some of our deepest friendships and greatest \n          sense of fulfillment comes from.</h5>\n        <h5>If we're going to do this, we need a framework (not a recipe) for \n          pastoral counseling that is rooted in sound New Testament theology of \n          sanctification.  Unless we have this, we probably won't develop very \n          well in this area--and we will be conformed by default to the secular \n          frameworks . . . </h5>\n      </blockquote>\n      <h3 class=\"MsoTitle\">Discussion of Counseling Models Assignment<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/servanthood2/laycounsel.htm#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\"><p> \n        <b><p>[1]</p></b> </p></a></h3>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelB0\">Dynamic Model</h4>\n      <blockquote> \n        <h5 class=\"LevelB0\">Basic Tenets</h5>\n        <blockquote> \n          <h5 class=\"LevelC0\"><i>What was the basic presupposition about human nature? \n            Why do people do what they do?</i></h5>\n          <h5 class=\"LevelD0\">“According to the <i>Dynamic Model</i>, people \n            are controlled by internal processes…of which they are unaware. \n            The roots of these…and the source of their current strength are \n            found in the past, in the person’s childhood.” (Lawrence \n            Crabb, “Understanding People” [Grand Rapids: Zondervan Publishing \n            House, 1987], p. 83.)</h5>\n          <h5 class=\"LevelD0\">Humans are merely organisms and the goal of counseling \n            is to heal the damage done by these past traumas.</h5>\n          <h5 class=\"LevelD0\">Sigmund Freud’s Psychoanalytic approach popularized \n            this perspective and viewed emotional problems as a sickness.  They \n            originate from deeper subconscious factors.</h5>\n          <h5 class=\"LevelC0\"><i>Based on that understanding of the nature of problems, \n            what is required (according to this view) for healing?</i></h5>\n          <h5 class=\"LevelD0\">Requires drawing out or understanding the subconscious \n            factors and resolving internal conflict.</h5>\n          <h5 class=\"LevelB0\">Comparison with biblical view of man</h5>\n        </blockquote>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelC0\">Pro’s</h5>\n        <blockquote> \n          <h5 class=\"LevelD0\">  This view illustrates that aspect of \n            human nature that results in us having a hard time doing even what \n            we know is right. This corresponds well with Paul’s discussion \n            of the “flesh” from Romans <time>7:15</time> – “That which I am doing I don’t \n            understand…” </h5>\n          <h5 class=\"LevelD0\">  This view has a category for mental \n            illness, physiological and organic causes which also corresponds with \n            the biblical perspective that these exist.</h5>\n          <h5 class=\"LevelD0\">  The Dynamic counselor would probably \n            agree with Crabb’s view that man is capable of evaluative thinking \n            (because their counsel depends on the impact of the client remembering \n            the past and mentally processing new information [counsel]).</h5>\n          <h5 class=\"LevelD0\"> The Dynamic counselor would also probably be fine \n            with Crabb’s assertion that the Bible supports man’s design \n            including “emotional experiencing.” </h5>\n          <h5 class=\"LevelD0\"> Crabb defines one aspect of human nature as “deep \n            longings” (p. 94) which he partly describes as “too deep \n            to be dismissed as an emotional reaction…something within mankind \n            is capable of longing for satisfaction in the deepest parts of the \n            personality.”  This could correspond to the sub-conscious factors \n            affecting behavior emotions, and attitudes.</h5>\n          <h5 class=\"LevelE0\">Crabb implies dynamics almost too deep for cognitive \n            evaluation that drive humans.</h5>\n          <blockquote> \n            <h5 class=\"LevelD0\">  The past does affect the present \n              and the future if not resolved</h5>\n            <h5 class=\"LevelD0\">  As the above point implies, much \n              of what we do is in the subconscious, or a result of “reacting \n              without realizing” (like automatic responses that seem to imply \n              we are not at fault), however there are differences </h5>\n          </blockquote>\n        </blockquote>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelC0\">Con’s</h5>\n        <blockquote> \n          <h5>  The Dynamic model says that our actions and problems \n            are a result of innate and natural aspects of our design.  In other \n            words, there is no such thing as moral responsibility. Man is only \n            a victim of unseen forces and antecedent causes. The Bible says that \n            the Fall of man, an immoral choice, was the cause of our sin nature \n            and is still influencing us (Romans <time>5:12</time>-14; 6:6).</h5>\n          <h5>  Because we merely do what we are “programmed” \n            to do, the Dynamic model assigns no moral judgment to the behavior, \n            thinking, attitudes, or emotions of humans.  The Bible however is \n            clear that humans are moral beings responsible for their actions (Romans \n            <time>3:23</time>; <time>6:23</time>).  </h5>\n          <h5>Related to this is the issue of “choice”.  Crabb points \n            out that one element of human nature is that we can “actively \n            choose.” Yet Dynamic counselors would say that there are no real \n            choices between right and wrong because there are no moral absolutes.  \n            Also, our actions are largely a product of our experiences in the \n            past and our physiology, both of which are unchangeable. The Bible \n            asserts humans must choose against their sin nature, even if there \n            are internal dynamics that make that choice more difficult (Romans \n            <time>6:13</time>).</h5>\n          <h5>  The Dynamic model would state that we are unchangeable \n            in “essence.”  Although therapy will help adjusting to these \n            innate traits, those traits cannot be changed. The Bible contradicts \n            that saying that we are given a completely new Identity when we become \n            Christians, the identity of Christ himself (Romans 6:6).  That change \n            in “essence” provides the basis for our ability to choose \n            to present ourselves  to sin (act according to our sin nature) or \n            to righteousness (Romans <time>6:13</time>).</h5>\n        </blockquote>\n      </blockquote>\n      <h4>Relational Model</h4>\n      <blockquote> \n        <h5>Basic Tenets</h5>\n        <blockquote> \n          <h5 class=\"LevelC0\"><i>What was the basic presupposition about human nature? \n            Why do people do what they do?</i></h5>\n          <h5 class=\"LevelD0\">Bottom line: we were designed to love and be loved \n            (Crabb, p. 83).  “Our deepest parts cry out for intimacy and \n            meaningful involvement with others.” </h5>\n          <h5 class=\"LevelE0\">The basic problem with people is that they have been \n            damaged by bad relationships. “Human problems…are…defensive \n            attempts to handle the pain of fear and tension in significant relationships.”</h5>\n          <h5 class=\"LevelE0\">Our defensive reactions lead to further damage to \n            relationships which result in our becoming more defensive to preclude \n            further damage – a self-perpetuating cycle.</h5>\n          <h5 class=\"LevelC0\"><i>Based on that understanding of the nature of problems, \n            what is required (according to this view) for healing?</i></h5>\n          <h5 class=\"LevelD0\">The therapist tries to restore the client’s trust \n            in relationships, beginning with their own.

The light of God’s view of them often sheds \n        the scales of deception.  It enables them to view their sin with humility \n        but focus on a forward view of walking in the Spirit and applying their \n        new identity in practical ways (next stage).</h4>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelC0\"><i>STAGE 4 - Right Actions</i>: Knowing and believing \n        God’s view of them will not be enough.  For truth to transform our \n        lives, we need to not only know it and affirm its truthfulness--we also \n        need to act in faith on it in concrete situations (Romans <time>6:13</time>).  \n        Prayerfully help the counselee to identify such steps.  They will usually \n        involve both resistance and replacement.  </h4>\n      <blockquote>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelD0\">\"Resistance\" means choosing not to take an \n          action that based on a lie in this area.  </h5>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelD0\">\"Replacement\" means choosing to take an action \n          that is based on truth in this same area.  \"Replacement\" especially \n          involves practicing Christian love (see \"Love Therapy\" for \n          more detail on this).</h5>\n      </blockquote>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelC0\"><i>STAGE 5 - Gradual change in habits, thinking, attitude, \n        feelings</i>: Over time, we should see a gradual cessation of both the \n        harmful behaviors and painful feelings, and a corresponding increase of \n        healthy behavior and emotions.</h4>\n      <blockquote> \n        <h5 class=\"LevelD0\">Noting this gradual change will be important on at least \n          a couple of fronts:</h5>\n        <blockquote> \n          <h5>The counselee will have setbacks in the very area they have experienced \n            growth.

Rather we want to draw them \n            out and help them form their own conclusions (and convictions) based \n            on the biblical perspective.  Asking questions of the counselee at \n            each stage is the best way to help them pursue God’s perspective. \n            Studying passages and materials on identity, etc. will be important, \n            as well as your instruction.</h4>\n          <h4>  Although this model accurately reflects the appropriation \n            of our new identity as Paul describes in Romans 6, there are too many \n            variables the person is bringing with them to be rigid.  </h4>\n          <h4 class=\"LevelD0\">How mature in the Lord are they? Do they already clearly \n            understand the need to, how to, and what specific identity issues \n            to appropriate?  Perhaps they are struggling only with practical issues \n            of “presenting” themselves (Stage 4).  You will be able \n            to move quickly through earlier stages, though not skipping them.</h4>\n          <h4 class=\"LevelD0\">Is the behavioral problem dangerous to them or someone \n            else?

Think through the importance of helping \n            the person be convinced of <i>why</i> they should do what they should \n            do (stage 3).  Spend time in prayer and thought on how you will listen \n            carefully.  </h4>\n          <h4 class=\"LevelC0\">Or do we shy away from calling for action?  Helping \n            the person see their faulty beliefs and what God says is true might \n            come naturally to you. Yet you tend to be afraid of their reaction \n            when it comes time to say, “and what will it look like to act \n            in faith in this area (stage 4)?” </h4>\n        </blockquote>\n        <h4 class=\"LevelB0\"> 3. Conferring \n          with other mature Christians before or during the process of counseling \n          can be very helpful.  Their wisdom and experience can be brought to \n          bear on the issue and your objectivity can be honed.  (See Gary DeLashmutt \n          and Dennis McCallum’s paper on <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/psych89.htm\">Conferral \n          and Confidentiality in the body of Christ</a>.)</h4>\n        <blockquote>\n          <h4 class=\"LevelB0\">These points are important to consider, yet we want \n            to maintain our conviction that through the appropriation of their \n            new identity in Christ, the counselee has the resources to be sanctified \n            on the deepest of levels, as well as the most obvious behaviors. Other \n            models, deeper understanding of the past, temperaments, etc. are helpful, \n            but the real change happens here.</h4>\n        </blockquote>\n      </blockquote>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelA0\">Examples to illustrate the model <p>(note: the “answer” after each <i>question</i> \n        is just one possible reason chosen just for illustration-sake).</p></h4>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelB0\">Dishonesty About Sin and Problems</h4>\n      <blockquote> \n        <h5 class=\"LevelC0\"><i>Why do I lie to others (actively or passively) about \n          my problems, sins, failures, etc.?</i> Because this protects me from \n          rejection by others and the embarrassment of exposure.  </h5>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelC0\"><i>What does it mean when I do this?  </i>It means that \n          I believe that people's acceptance is necessary for my acceptance and \n          security.</h5>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelC0\"><i>What is actually true? </i>God accepts me in spite \n          of my current failure--and that his acceptance is enough for me (Ephesians \n          1:7; Colossians 2:13,14).

Wrongfully, I am looking to my performance \n          and accomplishments as the source. Therefore, any critique of what I \n          have done, or haven’t (but the person believes I should have), \n          must be defended!</h5>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelC0\"><i>What is actually true?  </i>I am already significant \n          because of how God has created me apart from good works (Ephesians 1:9,10; \n          <time>2:10</time>); he loves me regardless of performance \n          “faults”.</h5>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelC0\"><i>How should I respond?</i> I should decide that I \n          must believe what God says is true about me, not what my feelings are \n          telling me (which is a lie).  If my bad reactions are immediate and \n          seemingly uncontrollable, I will present myself to God daily (multiply) \n          in prayer asking that he supernaturally gives me a “pause” \n          a “gap” between the provocation and my response so that I \n          can mentally process what is actually true about myself.  I should consider \n          learning to make my first responses questions, not defenses. Asking \n          more about why the person believes what they do can help. If I feel \n          I am on the verge of “losing it” I should learn to tell the \n          person that, and ask to be excused for a few minutes (1/2 hour?) to \n          go away and process what is being said.  I should cultivate an attitude \n          that I want critique – that my performance isn’t perfect in \n          any venue and I should expect critique (whether righteously given or \n          not).  I should study the biblical view of “righteous anger” \n          so that I never use “I’m right and they are wrong” as \n          an excuse to lose my temper.</h5>\n      </blockquote>\n      <h3 class=\"LevelA0\">Conclusion</h3>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelB0\">It might be overwhelming to contemplate counseling someone \n        when there are so many apparently complicated factors to consider.  Indeed, \n        the development of the wisdom and skills to be effective is a lifelong \n        process, not the result of passing the Servanthood 2 course.  It is good \n        to remember that the Holy Spirit is more committed than you are to helping \n        others and will help you if you are dependent on him.  Remembering key \n        elements from tonight will be important:</h4>\n      <blockquote> \n        <h5 class=\"LevelC0\">  “Counseling” most often happens \n          in the context of a discipling relationship as we get together with \n          them in the usual venue (breakfasts, lunches, etc.). It isn’t necessarily \n          a special meeting for a certain purpose.  In essence it is helping another \n          Christian’s pursuit of sanctification.</h5>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelC0\">  All Christian workers are called to help \n          one another grow and therefore should do pastoral counseling.</h5>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelC0\">  “Counseling” isn’t necessarily \n          reactive to severe problems. In fact, most often it is responsive to \n          weaknesses in character or ministry that the Lord has prioritized.</h5>\n        <h5 class=\"LevelC0\">  “Counseling” is helping the \n          person live out their new identity in Christ in his power, but can’t \n          be applied rigidly.</h5>\n      </blockquote>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelB0\">Do you have a vision for God powerfully using you to be \n        his tool in helping others mature? Look around this room. If we live out \n        a 2 Timothy 2:2 model, how will the cause of Christ be advanced – \n        even around the world!  His power, his wisdom lived out by how we model \n        it and by how we disciple others.</h4>\n      <h3 class=\"LevelA0\">Assignment Due Next Week</h3>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelB0\">Study for next week’s quiz.  Note memory verses and \n        “key point to know for the exam” sections.</h4>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelA0\">Memory Verses</h4>\n      <blockquote>\n        <h4 class=\"LevelB0\">None this week</h4>\n      </blockquote>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelA0\">Key Points to Know for Exam</h4>\n      <blockquote>\n        <h4 class=\"LevelB0\"> 1.

She is by definition tribalistic, and usually kind, emotional,\n            and sacrificial. Their selfless giving is motivated by heartfelt\n            affection and duty, but there is a catch.</p>\n          <p>The work-for-love eventually begins to feel resentment about the\n            fact that her family doesn't appreciate her enough. As these feelings\n            of resentment arise, the work-for-love reacts by working harder than\n            ever. Hence, the term work-for-love. She actually works and serves\n            those in her family, not in an authentically sacrificial way, but\n            in order to buy love from them.</p>\n          <p>Because she is actually bribing her family to love her, she finds\n            it impossible to appropriately discipline. She is vulnerable to manipulation\n            by others at the same time that she is guilty of manipulating them\n            through \"guilt trips,\" martyr complex, etc. This failure to discipline\n            ironically leads her tribe to take her for granted.</p>\n          <p>Later in life, when the children leave home, the work-for-love reaches\n            a serious crisis in her life. Her husband (who she has not disciplined),\n            who is often a work substitute, cannot meet her emotional needs,\n            and she has failed to build other deep relationships outside of the\n            family. She usually has not built skills and interests in the functional\n            area either, other than cooking, sewing etc. for the kids. As a result,\n            she may become increasingly depressed, neurotic and extravagant in\n            her efforts to attract attention from her uncaring family.</p>\n          <p>Work-for-love Christians, with their zeal for service and encouragement,\n            can be a great resource to the Body of Christ. But they often run\n            into trouble with discipleship when loving confrontation is necessary.</p>\n          <p>This love defect appears to be diminishing today. Postmodernism,\n            feminism and the media have worked hard to reject the ethic of the\n            serving spouse and mother.</p>\n          <p>Spiritual Impact:</p>\n          <blockquote>\n            <p>Discipleship is difficult because of the unwillingness to discipline.\n              Many times the work for love has a hard time being critiqued.</p>\n          </blockquote>\n        </blockquote>\n      </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Servanthood 2 - Introduction to Love Therapy","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/servanthood2/lovethrpy.htm"}

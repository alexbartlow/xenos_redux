\n          2 Corinthians <time>11:28</time>,29).  But not on your ministry results. \n          You take your security from the fact that you are God’s child, \n          forgiven, gifted and called to a role in his church, etc.  This focus \n          helps us to be patient and genuinely serving with others—and to \n          be open to constructive criticism.  </h4>\n        <h4 class=\"LevelC0\"> <b>3.</b> When you minister under law, you have a <i>horizontal focus</i>.  \n          You tend to compare yourself to other workers in terms of gifting, ministry \n          fruit, roles in the church, etc.  You are a success only if you are \n          better than other people in these areas.  You can only be significant \n          if you teach, are a leader, etc.  </h4>\n        <h4 class=\"LevelD0\">Symptoms:</h4>\n        <blockquote> \n          <h4 class=\"LevelE0\">  This perspective usually starts with \n            us seeing ourselves superior to others in some area and once Satan \n            sees our horizontal focus, he now highlights where we are inferior \n            (see Galatians 5:26; 6:3-5).  This fleshly competitive linkage \n            will breed division within the church—something Satan is always \n            promoting.</h4>\n          <h4>  This perspective may lead to provincialism--caring \n            only about success in your particular ministry, rather than also caring \n            about and working for success in other ministry spheres in your home \n            group and in the church as a whole.</h4>\n          <h4 class=\"LevelE0\">  You may become inordinately critical \n            of others' ministry skills or results.</h4>\n          <h4 class=\"LevelD0\">With honesty, consider these questions:</h4>\n          <blockquote> \n            <h4 class=\"Quote\">Do you have the habit of looking around at others \n              with callings close to yours? </h4>\n            <h4 class=\"Quote\">Do you feel called into question by their achievements? </h4>\n            <h4 class=\"Quote\">Do you feel that their success is more than they deserve and yours somehow less?</h4>\n            <h4 class=\"Quote\">Are you disappointed, even angry, at the gap between your desires and your accomplishments?</h4>\n          </blockquote>\n          <h4 class=\"LevelD0\">When you minister under grace, you have a <i>vertical \n            focus</i>.  You realize that all such comparisons with other workers \n            are foolish, because there are so many variables in terms of gifting, \n            ministry experience, etc.  Instead, you focus on the fact that God \n            has given you the role he knows is best for you and his church at \n            the present time.  </h4>\n          <h4 class=\"Quote\">When Jesus calls, he calls us one by one. Comparisons \n            are idle, speculations about others a waste of time, and envy as silly \n            as it is evil. We are each called individually, accountable to God \n            alone, to please him alone, and eventually to be approved by him alone. \n            If ever we are tempted to look around, compare notes, and use the \n            progress of others to judge the success of our own calling, we will \n            hear what Peter heard: “What is that to you? Follow me!” \n            (Os Guinness, The Call, pp. 132,133)</h4>\n          <h4 class=\"LevelE0\">He’s not asking you to be like someone else—he \n            just wants you to serve him in the capacity and situation in which \n            he has placed you.  This frees you to be thankful for the diversity \n            of roles and gifts in the Body of Christ, and for the opportunity \n            to work with and benefit from others’ ministry.</h4>\n          <h4 class=\"Quote\">Consider the mighty ways in which God used a dead stick \n            of wood. “God so used a stick of wood” can be a banner cry \n            for each of us. Though we are limited and weak in talent, physical \n            energy and psychological strength, we are not less than a stick of \n            wood. But as the rod of Moses had to become the rod of God, so that \n            which I <i>me</i> must become the <i>me</i> of God. Then, I can become \n            useful in God’s hands. The Scripture emphasizes that much can \n            come from little if the little is truly consecrated to God. There \n            are no little people and no big people in the true spiritual sense, \n            but only consecrated and unconsecrated people. The problem for each \n            of us is applying this truth to ourselves: Is Francis Schaeffer the \n            Francis Schaeffer of God? (Francis Schaeffer, No Little People, p. \n            17)</h4>\n        </blockquote>\n        <h4 class=\"LevelC0\"> <b>4.</b> When you minister under law, you often have a <i>perfectionistic \n          standard</i>.  You cannot feel satisfied unless your ministry attempts \n          have been flawless.  </h4>\n        <h4 class=\"LevelD0\">Symptoms:</h4>\n        <blockquote> \n          <h4 class=\"LevelE0\"> You may focus on all of the flaws in your outreach, \n            teaching, discipleship, etc.  Obviously, this leads either to self-deception \n            or (more likely) to demoralization over time.  </h4>\n          <h4 class=\"LevelE0\"> This focus will usually make you reluctant to try \n            new things in ministry—because you have virtually no chance of \n            doing something new perfectly!</h4>\n          <h4 class=\"LevelE0\"> You may become unduly rigorous with others.  Rather \n            than seeing and encouraging gradual progress, you may only notice \n            where they are still lacking.</h4>\n          <h4 class=\"LevelE0\"> You may be a \"black and white\" thinker--difficult \n            to see matters that are \"gray\" or to acquiesce to something \n            less than ideal.</h4>\n          <h4 class=\"LevelE0\"> Extra-biblical imperatives easily creep in – \n            we take strong “moral” stands on issues God doesn’t!  \n            Dating standards that go beyond the Bible, the “right” number \n            of meetings per week if you are godly, the godly time to fellowship \n            after the teaching.</h4>\n          <h4 class=\"LevelD0\">When you minister under grace, you focus more on your \n            availability to God, trusting his ability to multiply your meager \n            offerings (FEEDING OF THE 5000; Ephesians <time>3:20</time>). \n            You reject all perfectionism because as a fallen person in a fallen \n            world, no ministry or ministry attempt will ever be perfect.  You \n            focus rather on the fact that God is pleased if you want to serve \n            and are willing to get out there and do the best you can.  You focus \n            on the general direction of your life and ministry. You view new ministry \n            opportunities as just that—opportunities to trust God in new \n            ways and to experience his grace and empowering.</h4>\n        </blockquote>\n        <h4 class=\"LevelC0\"> <b>5.</b> When you minister under law, there will be relatively <i>less \n          dependence on prayer</i> related to your ministry attempts.  Because \n          we think we can and must do the work by ourselves, prayer is more of \n          an after-thought.</h4>\n        <h4 class=\"LevelD0\">Symptoms:</h4>\n        <blockquote> \n          <h4>  You may find that you seldom pray for the people \n            you are serving or reaching out to.</h4>\n          <h4>  When correcting or challenging someone who does not \n            agree with you, you may have a difficult time walking away without \n            \"winning\" (which requires prayerfully trusting that God \n            will work).</h4>\n          <h4>When you minister under grace you will have a greater and <i>greater \n            emphasis on prayer</i> as central to your ministry: affirming God’s \n            faithfulness and adequacy, intercessory prayer for people to be convicted, \n            illuminated, etc.--and prayer for guidance on how you can “keep \n            in step” with what the Spirit is doing in others’ lives. \n            You become more and more convinced of your own inadequacy to change \n            people’s lives—but more and more confident that God is adequate \n            and will make you adequate to play your part (2 Corinthians 2:14;

The \n          Bible teaches that it is God and God alone that supplies spiritual zeal.  \n          It also teaches that we have a role in cultivating and maintaining that \n          zeal.  Both of these insights are contained in Paul's exhortation to \n          Timothy in Philippians 2:12,13.</h4>\n        <blockquote> \n          <h4 class=\"LevelD0\">\" Philippians 2:12 <p>So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not \n            as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out \n            your salvation with fear and trembling; <sup>13</sup> for it is God \n            who is at work in you, both to will and to work for <i>His</i> good \n            pleasure.</p> \"  This is the indicative that emphasizes that \n            God's Spirit supplies the resources for zeal.</h4>\n          <h4 class=\"LevelD0\">\" . . . kindle afresh the \n            gift of God which is in you . . . \"  This \n            is the imperative that makes it clear that unless we tend the fire \n            God's Spirit puts in us, it will die down.  \"Fan back into full \n            flame\" is our role.  Paul assumed Timothy knew how to do this, \n            and we need to know, too. </h4>\n        </blockquote>\n        <h4 class=\"LevelC0\"> 2. Human \n          agency is required to maintain the zeal. Romans<time> \n          12:11</time> also affirms our part in maintaining zeal: \"Never \n          flag in zeal, be aglow with the Spirit, serve the Lord.\"  Maintaining \n          zeal may be compared to tending a fire. The energy is there in the logs, \n          the fire is supplied by the match--but human agency is required.  The \n          fire will tend to die down, but only by neglect will it die out.  You \n          have to learn how to keep an eye on the fire, stoke it, feed it, etc.  \n          This is one of the most important skills to develop in the Christian \n          life.</h4>\n      </blockquote>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelB0\"><b>Checklist for cultivating zeal</b></h4>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelC0\"> 1. <i>Do \n        you expose yourself regularly to zealous people?</i>  The zeal of others \n        can \"stir you up\" if you are spiritually responsive (2 Cor. \n        9:2).  It's like one burning match touching off another.</h4>\n      <blockquote> \n        <h4 class=\"LevelD0\">The same is true of Christian workers even when they \n          are not teaching.  This is one of the great benefits of vital fellowship: \n          you can rekindle zeal in each other.</h4>\n        <h4 class=\"LevelD0\">Another way to catch others' zeal is to read biographies \n          of Christian workers (DAWS; BURNING HEART; WHITEFIELD).</h4>\n        <h4 class=\"LevelD0\">Avoid regular, close contact with chronically unzealous \n          Christians.  They not only don't get stirred up by your zeal; they can \n          drain you of it, especially if you are a young believer or expecting \n          them to be vital.</h4>\n        <h4 class=\"Quote\">SPURGEON: \"We shall often find ourselves in danger \n          of deteriorating our zeal by the cold Christian people with whom we \n          come in contact.  What terrible wet blankets some (Christians) are! . . . If \n          these frost-bitten men should happen to be the officers of the church, \n          from whom you naturally expect the warmest sympathy, the result is chilling \n          to the last degree, and all the more if you are young and inexperienced . . . \"</h4>\n        <h4 class=\"LevelD0\">But this is not enough. While we should definitely take \n          advantage of this \"jump start\" that God provides, every worker \n          has to learn how to cultivate it when no one else has it so he can stir \n          them up.  This is an essential ability for spiritual leaders.</h4>\n      </blockquote>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelC0\"> 2. <i>Do \n        you pray for zeal regularly?</i>  SPURGEON: \"Fan (the flame of zeal) \n        with much supplication . . . There is . . . an \n        absolute necessity of prayer . . . To fan your (zeal) \n        to a vehement flame you should seek the spirit of continual prayer.\"</h4>\n      <blockquote> \n        <h4>Oswald Sanders cites a couple of scholars' interpretations of Luke \n          11:9-13 that bears on this.  The lack of the definite article before \n          Holy Spirit suggests that Jesus is referring not to the Person of the \n          Holy Spirit, but to his operations or resources.  If you ask God for \n          zeal to serve him, he will give it to you through the work of the Holy \n          Spirit in your life.</h4>\n        <h4>In my own life, there is a definite correlation between spending time \n          alone with God in prayer and the zeal that I have.  I normally do not \n          experience it while I am praying, but afterward, during the course of \n          the day.  Those of you who are struggling to maintain your zeal--how \n          regularly do you pray that God will fill your heart with zeal for him \n          and his work?  This is an obvious application of James 4:2--many \n          of us get depleted in zeal simply because we don't regularly ask for \n          it!!  </h4>\n      </blockquote>\n      <h4> 3. <i>Do \n        you fuel it with God's Word?</i>  In Luke 24:32, the two disciples on \n        the road to Emmaus described their reaction to Jesus teaching them the \n        Word--\"our hearts were burning within us.\"  Christ was illuminating \n        them to not only understand the meaning of scripture, but also its significance \n        and importance for them personally.</h4>\n      <blockquote> \n        <h4 class=\"LevelD0\">It is essential that we are burdened when we teach.  \n          When we speak of developing a burden, we mean that we have become personally \n          convinced of the significance of this truth for ourselves and for others.  \n          John Stott calls it \"so possessing the truth that the truth possesses \n          you.\"  This is zeal.</h4>\n        <h4 class=\"LevelD0\">How do you get this?  As you study scripture, prayerfully \n          ask yourself these questions concerning the truth you are studying:</h4>\n        <blockquote> \n          <h4>When did I first learn this truth?  How did my life suffer because \n            I was ignorant of it?  How did learning it and applying it change \n            my life at that time?  How has it done the same thing since?  How \n            was my life hurt because I have refused to respond to this truth?  \n            How does this truth apply to me now?</h4>\n          <h4 class=\"LevelE0\">How is this person suffering because he is ignorant \n            of this truth?  What could happen to him if he learns it and applies \n            it?</h4>\n        </blockquote>\n        <h4 class=\"LevelE0\">Learn to study and meditate on scripture this way, and \n          you will have an inexhaustible source of zeal!!</h4>\n      </blockquote>\n      <h4 class=\"LevelC0\"> 4. <i>Are \n        you responsive to the Holy Spirit’s personal guidance in moral &amp; \n        ministry matters?

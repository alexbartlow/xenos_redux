Praise psalms\nare often more general in their content and more focused on who God is rather than what he\nhas done. When God's actions are described, they are frequently used to detail aspects of\nGod's character, which are then praised by the psalmist. Inevitably, there is overlap\nbetween these genres, however, close reading of praise and thanksgiving literature does\nshow differences.&#xA0; \n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>A call to praise (directed toward self or others)&#xA0; </li>\n    <li>Reasons for the praise (e.g. attributes of God or deeds of\n      God)&#xA0; </li>\n    <li>Conclusion - often a repetition of the opening call to\n      praise (i.e. inclusio).&#xA0; </li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Types of praise psalms include:&#xA0; </li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li><u>Hymns</u><sup><a name=\"Ref2\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/psalms/psweek5.htm#Note2\">[2]</a></sup>&#xA0; - songs of praise&#xA0; </li>\n    <li><u>Covenant Songs</u> - psalms directed toward the covenant\n      relationships between God and others&#xA0; </li>\n    <li><u>Hymns of Zion/Temple</u> - psalms focused on Jerusalem\n      the place of the presence of God.&#xA0; </li>\n    <li><u>Royal Psalms</u> - These focus on the human king of\n      Israel or upon YHWH as king of Israel (47:7)&#xA0; </li>\n    <li><u>Messianic Psalms</u> - these psalms attend to predictions\n      concerning God's anointed representative who is yet to come or the kingdom he will rule.\n      &#xA0; </li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Some psalms have elements of more than one genre.<sup><a name=\"Ref3\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/psalms/psweek5.htm#Note3\">[3]</a></sup>&#xA0;&#xA0; </li>\n  <li>The importance of praise - many of the same things may be\n    said of praise as of gratitude.&#xA0; </li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li><u>It's commanded</u> (Ps. 47:7; 69:34; 96:2; Heb.13:15;\n      Ja.5:13 )&#xA0; </li>\n    <li><u>It's reasonable</u> - 2Sam.22:4; 1Chron.16:25; Ps.33:1;\n      66; 92:1; 147:1<br>\n      Ps.33:4-12 b/c he's righteous, just, loving, the creator, ruler &amp; attentive to us. <br>\n      Ps.92:1 b/c of his love and fidelity&#xA0; </li>\n    <li><u>It changes our perspective</u> Ps.19; 33:16-22; 92; 139;\n      146; 147&#xA0; </li>\n    <li><u>It's pleasant</u> 2Sam.6:12-22; Ps.135:3; 147:1; 148;\n      149, 150 </li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Hymns&#xA0; \n\n</b>Examples include: 8, 19:1-6; 33, 66:1-12, 67, 95, 100,\n    103, 104, 111, 113, 114, 117, 145-150&#xA0; \n  </p><li><a name=\"Psalm%2033\">Psalm 33</a> - YHWH is our creator and\n    gracious King <b></b></li>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><u>Situation of the psalmist</u> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>The LXX &amp; 4QPs ascribes this psalm to David.

The term\ncame to have a specialized meaning in Hebrew literature as a particular individual whom\nGod would send at some future date to restore theocracy on earth and who was, in fact, God\nhimself, although this information was only slowly revealed. Early references do not\nspecify that they refer to a single character - the Messiah. Rather, we infer it from the\nclaims they do make and from their similarity to other definitive messianic passages.\n&#xA0; \n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>The Kingdom - 2, 18, 20, 21, 45, 61, 72, 89, 110, 132&#xA0; </li>\n    <li>The Messiah - 8, 16, 22, 35, 40, 41, 55, 69, 102, 109&#xA0; </li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><u>Situation of the psalmist<b> </b></u></p>\n  \n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <u><b></b></u><p>This is a psalm of David, more than that is\n  unclear. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><u>Structure of the psalm<b></b></u></p>\n  \n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <b><u></u></b><p>This psalm is formed from two oracles.&#xA0; </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>The 1st promise (v.1) and result (vv.2-3)&#xA0; </li>\n    <li>The 2nd promise (v.4) and result (vv.5-7) </li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><u>Analysis of the psalm <b></b></u></p>\n  \n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <u><b></b></u><p>A Psalm of David. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"7\" width=\"570\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"27%\" valign=\"TOP\">1<p>The Lord says to my Lord: Sit\n    at My right hand Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.<sup>1</sup></p></td>\n    <td width=\"73%\" valign=\"TOP\"><i>The affirmation of Jehovah to\n    my Lord: `Sit at My right hand, Till I make your enemies your footstool.'</i><b></b><p>YHWH\n    says to Adonai &#x96; I will subjugate your enemies to you.</p>\n    <sup></sup>an idiom arising from the practice of a king putting his feet on the\n    necks of his defeated enemies (Josh.10:24; 1Ki.5:3)\n    <p>See Mt.22:44</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"27%\" valign=\"TOP\">2<p>The LORD will stretch forth\n    Your strong scepter from Zion, saying, Rule in the midst of Your enemies.</p></td>\n    <td width=\"73%\" valign=\"TOP\"><i>The rod of your strength does\n    Jehovah send from Zion, Rule in the midst of your enemies.</i><b></b><p>You will rule your\n    enemies from Jerusalem</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"27%\" valign=\"TOP\">3<p>Your people will volunteer\n    freely in the day of Your power;<sup>1</sup> In holy array,<sup>2</sup> from the womb of\n    the dawn, Your youth are to You as the dew.<sup>3</sup> </p></td>\n    <td width=\"73%\" valign=\"TOP\"><i>Your people are free-will\n    gifts in the day of Your strength, in the honors of holiness, From the womb, from the\n    morning, You have the dew of your youth.</i><sup></sup> Or army\n    <sup></sup> Or the splendor of holiness\n    <sup></sup> Or The dew of Your youth is Yours; MT reads, &#x91;young men will come\n    like the dew&#x92; a reference to the quantity of volunteers for the Lords army.<ul>\n      <b>\n      <li>Your people will volunteer for your vast army.</li></b></ul>\n    \n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"27%\" valign=\"TOP\">4<p>The LORD has sworn and will\n    not change His mind, You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek. </p></td>\n    <td width=\"73%\" valign=\"TOP\"><i>Jehovah have sworn, and does\n    not repent, `You art a priest to the age, According to the order of Melchizedek.'</i><b></b><p>YHWH\n    will make you a Melchizedek priest</p>\n    <p>Gen.14:18; Zech.6:13; Heb.5:6-10; 7:3, 22</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"27%\" valign=\"TOP\">5<p>The Lord is at Your right\n    hand; He will shatter<sup>1</sup> kings in the day of His wrath. </p></td>\n    <td width=\"73%\" valign=\"TOP\"><i>The Lord on your right hand\n    smote kings In the day of His anger</i>.<sup></sup> Or has shattered<ul>\n      <b>\n      <li>The Lord will destroy all opposition</li></b></ul>\n    \n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"27%\" valign=\"TOP\">6<p>He will judge among the\n    nations, He will fill<sup>1</sup> them with corpses, He will shatter<sup>2</sup> the chief\n    men over a broad country. </p></td>\n    <td width=\"73%\" valign=\"TOP\"><i>He does judge among the\n    nations, He has completed the carcasses, Has smitten the head over the mighty earth.</i><sup></sup>\n    Or has filled\n    <sup></sup> Or has shattered</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"27%\" valign=\"TOP\">7<p>He will drink from the brook\n    by the wayside; Therefore He will lift up His head. </p></td>\n    <td width=\"73%\" valign=\"TOP\"><i>From a brook in the way he\n    drinks, Therefore he does lift up the head!</i></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/psalms/index.htm\">previous page</a></p>\n\n<p><strong><sup>Notes:</sup></strong></p>\n\n<p><a name=\"Note1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>&#xA0; I am indebted to\nDennis Bratcher for these genre's and sub-categories of Psalms.

Psalms of gratitude focus on\nwhat God has done. Psalms of praise focus attention upon who God is. Of course, they\noverlap. God's actions arise from his nature but such a division has its value for us in\nthis class. * \n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Announcement of the intention to express gratitude (116:1)</li>\n    <li>Delineation of the nature of God's deliverance (116:3-11) </li>\n    <li>Conclusion (116:12-19) </li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Types of gratitude psalms include: </li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Community </li>\n    <li>Individual </li>\n    <li>Historical reflections </li>\n    <li>Expressions of trust </li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Some psalms have elements of more than one genre.<sup><a name=\"Ref3\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/psalms/psweek3.htm#Note3\">[3]</a></sup>&#xA0; </li>\n  <li>The importance of being grateful </li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><u>It's reasonable</u> - If awesome and beautiful things\n  ought to be praised, how much more should the creator be praised; We'd call someone\n  incapable of responding appropriately to beauty and majesty - autistic, mentally\n  deficient. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"...man's chief end is to glorify God and enjoy him\n  forever\" - <em>Westminster Confession </em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"To fully enjoy is to glorify.

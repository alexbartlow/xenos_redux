The Psalms regard death as something terrible (55:4) </p>\n\n<p>2. The Psalms don't explicitly deny existence after death\nand in some places seem to affirm continued existence after death. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a) Ps.16:10 \"...will not abandon me to the\n  grave...will...fill me with...eternal pleasures at your right hand.\"; Ps.21\n  \"surely you have granted him eternal blessings...\"; Ps.49:15 \"but God will\n  redeem my life from the grave; he will surely take me to himself.\" It might be that\n  the psalmist is engaging in hyperbole but compare 49:14 with 49:15. </p>\n  <p>b) Other OT passages seem to suggest existence after death\n  (e.g. the accounts of Enoch &amp; Elijah being translated to heaven; David assured that he\n  would join his dead child one day;<sup><a name=\"Ref1\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/psalms/psdeath.htm#Note1\">[1]</a></sup>&#xA0;\n  Samuel appearing to Saul through the witch of Endor {1Sam.28}; see also Ps. 73:24;\n  Isa.26:14,19; 57:1f; Da.12:2-3). </p>\n  <p>c) The careful attention that the Hebrews paid to the\n  remains of their dead suggest some notion of an afterlife (e.g. burial, burial rites,\n  dis-internment and re-burial, defense of dead bodies from predators, rescue of dead bodies\n  being dishonored by enemies and so on). This is typically used by anthropologists as\n  evidence for such a belief, at any rate. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>3. While the Psalms and the rest of the OT do not deny\nexistence after death, what they do affirm about the post-mortem experience contrasts\nsignificantly from such descriptions in the NT. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a) The dead cannot remember or praise God (Ps.6:5; 30:9;\n  88:10-12; 115:17; Isa.38:18) </p>\n  <p>b) The dead know, plan &amp; do nothing (Ecc.9:10) </p>\n  <p>c) Several significant passages use terms related to\n  sleep/wake to describe a future state of the godly dead (e.g. Isal.26:14,19; 57:1f &amp;\n  Dan.12:2-3). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If we affirm the OT as revelation and that it cannot deny\n  subsequent revelation then there seems adequate justification to suggest that death was a\n  different state of being at one time. Clearly, in the NT, death seems to have the status\n  of a conscious spiritual state. Thus, there's no compelling reason to object to the notion\n  that prior to Christ's resurrection the people of God entered a state of 'sleep' and that\n  after Christ's resurrection, they awoke to eternal life.<sup><a name=\"Ref2\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/psalms/psdeath.htm#Note2\">[2]</a></sup>&#xA0; </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>4. The psalmist is trying to describe life, not afterlife. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a) Psalms are concerned with the future as it pertains to\n  God's promises rather than the future in and of itself. That is, they are concerned with\n  God as creator, sustainer, redeemer and king rather than, \"What's going to happen to\n  me when I die?\".<sup><a name=\"Ref3\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/psalms/psdeath.htm#Note3\">[3]</a></sup>&#xA0; </p>\n  <p>b) Psalms are concerned with polemics against paganism,\n  that God alone controls death (Ps.139) as contrasted with Mot,<sup><a name=\"Ref4\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/psalms/psdeath.htm#Note4\">[4]</a></sup>&#xA0; Osiris,<sup><a name=\"Ref5\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/psalms/psdeath.htm#Note5\">[5]</a></sup>&#xA0;\n  and others.<sup><a name=\"Ref6\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/psalms/psdeath.htm#Note6\">[6]</a></sup>&#xA0; </p>\n  <p>c) Psalms are concerned with apologetics for God\n  (Ex.19:5-6): * </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>He is both sovereign and benevolent toward individuals &amp;\n      nations - thus, a focus on the here and now would be expected.<sup><a name=\"Ref7\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/psalms/psdeath.htm#Note7\">[7]</a></sup>&#xA0; * </li>\n    <li>He enters into covenants with people (Abrahamic &amp; Mosaic\n      covenants) - thus, a focus on how those covenants work out here and now would also be\n      expected. <sup><a name=\"Ref8\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/psalms/psdeath.htm#Note8\">[8]</a></sup>&#xA0; </li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>5.

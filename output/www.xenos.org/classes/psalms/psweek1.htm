It's less precise. It's often less\ninformative. It's hard to read. All this is true but what's also true is that poetry slips\npast our guard (e.g. compare Exodus 14:26-31 with Exodus 15:1-5). As Longmann says,\n\"...poetry appeals more directly to the whole person than prose does.

These images\n  support the point the author is trying to make. The 1st Psalm is full of such images (e.g.\n  sitting in the seat of mockers v.1; like a tree planted by the waters v. 3; like the chaff\n  v.4).

They had become renowned\nin helping David (1 Chr 12:6), and were appointed over the service of worship (1 Chr\n6:31-32; 25). 2 Chr 20:19, in the time of Jehoshaphat, seems to be the last time they are\nheard of. However, Psalm 87, with the mention of Babylon (and possibly Psalm 85?), appears\nto be at least exilic. N. H. Ridderbos assumes that the sons of Korah did return after the\nexile since \"the sons of the gatekeepers\" are mentioned as such (Ezek 2:42 et\nal.).<u>57</u> This seems likely. Note that Heman the singer in the time of David stemmed\nfrom Korah (through Abiasaph, 1 Chronicles 6). So it seems some of the sons of Korah were\ngatekeepers, and some (through Heman?) were singers (<i>ergo</i> 2 Chr 20:19). Asaph the\nsinger stemmed from Gershon (through Libni). The sons of Heman and Asaph together are\nidentified as singers (1 Chr 6:33-48; 2 Chr 5:12). The sons of Asaph are sometimes\nidentified as <i>the</i> singers (Ezra 2:41; 3:10-11; Neh 7:44; 11:17,22; and perhaps\n12:46). But this designation does not necessarily seem to exclude the Korahite line of\nHeman (2 Chr 35:15). Given that the sons of Korah are never referred to by name in\nEzra/Nehemia, but only as \"the gatekeepers,\" it may not be out of place to\nunderstand singers from their line being subsumed under \"the sons of\nAsaph.\"\" <i>Return to <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/psalms/psweek1.htm#Ref17\">Text</a></i></p>\n\n<p><a name=\"Note18\"><sup>[18]</sup></a>&#xA0; Anderson\nsuggests that this is, \"...a chief among the singers appointed under David (1 Chr\n15:16ff.; 16:4-7,37; 25:1ff.)

We'll take a closer look at this period of the church and apply some of the lessons from the book of Acts to our situation today. Emphasis is placed on the historical situation and events of the first century. This class is intended, not only to provide an understanding of the book of Acts, but also to give some crucial background about Paul's epistles. </p>\n      <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/bcsyll.htm\">Basic Christianity</a> </b>- A great class for those who are moving towards Christianity but aren't sure where to begin. This course explores what the Bible says about the nature of God, God's role in your life, how to grow spiritually, and what \"church\" is all about. </p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/newgen/index.htm\"><b>Building a New Generation</b></a> - Parents have a dual challenge. The first is to produce emotionally and spiritually mature young adults who are able to take on life's responsibilities and challenges. The second is to minister to and positively impact our world in a godly and strategic way and to pass on this capability to the next generation. This course seeks to prepare parents for both challenges by examining our life's purpose, our world's needs, and the implications these things have for our families. </p>\n      <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/israelhistory/index.htm\"></a></b><b>Counseling courses</b> - The counseling department leads regular classes on relationship building, conflict management, marriage communication, and lay counseling. </p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/reason/index.htm\"><b>Critical Reasoning</b> </a>- The Bible calls Christians to be \"transformed by the renewing of our minds.\" This five-week class provides the basic skills necessary to think critically, communicate reasonably and exercise discernment in our thinking. </p>\n      <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm\"><b>Domestic Church Planting </b> </a>- </b> Have you ever thought about starting new church&#x2014;not a new home group, but an entirely new church in a new location? In this course, students will learn how new churches start, who is well suited to plant them, and why churches like ours need to plant new ones. We&#x2019;ll hear from church planters who have successfully started new churches, and study church planting movements in the past and present. If you think God may be calling you to start a new church, God may use this course to sharpen your vision! </p>\n      <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/schaeffer/index.htm\">Francis Schaeffer: An Introduction to His Apologetics</a></b> - This five-week course explains the Schaeffer's approach to apologetics, evangelism, and philosophy. Emphasis is given to how Schaeffer understood culture and what it takes to be an effective witness for Christ in a \"post-Christian\" era. Integrating Christian faith to all aspects of life was the foundation of Francis and Edith Schaeffer's ministry. This five-week course brings the Schaeffer's passion for cultural relevance, effective evangelism and spiritual integrity together with their example of ministry as a way of life. Fresh application of their thought is applied to being witnesses for Christ in our postmodern times. Participants read The God Who Is There and selections from The Letters of Francis Schaeffer. </p>\n      <p><b>God's Vision for the Church </b> - This class provides a review of the core biblical convictions that drive our approach to &#x201C;church.&#x201D; Teachers will raise and answer key questions such as: What is the church? What does it do? What is worship? Students will also explore barriers to commitment and keys to establishing an enduring ministry. &#xA0;</p>\n      <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/israelhistory/index.htm\">History of Modern Israel</a> </b>- This class deals with the history of modern Israel beginning with the Zionist movement in 1800s Europe through to the current day. We will look closely at the interaction between European cultural forces and the early Zionists leading up to the Holocaust as well as Israel's struggle for sovereignty as it played out in the United Nations. Most importantly, the class will examine both sides of the current struggle between Palestine and Israel along with the international political ramifications. </p>\n      <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/galatians/index.htm\">Inductive Studies in Galatians</a></b> - Paul's letter to the Galatians vigorously defends an essential New Testament truth: people are justified by faith in Jesus Christ and not our works. It was the rediscovery of this basic message that led to the Protestant Reformation. In this class you will learn to apply the inductive study method to discover for yourself the message this book holds for Christians.</p>\n      <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/ephesians/index.htm\">Inductive Studies in Ephesians</a> </b>- Ephesians contains some of the most heartfelt and spiritually contentful prayers Paul ever put into writing. The epistle written by the apostle Paul from a Roman prison cell provides us with many foundational truths. These essential truths about who we are in Christ have implications then for how we should live. </p>\n      <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/investigate/index.htm\">Investigating Christianity</a> </b>- Is Christianity\n           really true? Hasn't science proven the Bible wrong? Isn't it intolerant\n          \n        to day there's only one way to God? How could a loving God allow terrible\n           suffering? This class focuses on defining the key ideas in biblical\n          Christianity \n          and evaluates them against the most common counter-arguments in our culture\n        today. </p>\n      <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/Isaiah/index.htm\">Isaiah</a> </b>- In this five-week course, we will take an in-depth look at the book of Isaiah. It will be challenging and stimulating for mind and spirit alike. On the one hand, its historical context, authorship, and canonicity of Isaiah is complex. But, on the other hand, God reveals Himself in these pages&#x97;His character, perspectives, personality, and plans&#x97;in ways that are often moving, startling, and exhilarating. It is little wonder that this ancient book is so often cited in secular culture. Join us for this engaging and uplifting study. This class is open to all. Students should have a basic familiarity with the Old Testament and should read Isaiah prior to attending class. Graduates of Old Testament Survey and Hermeneutics will be best prepared for this class. </p>\n      <p><b>Sharing Your Faith </b>- This course is designed to help Christians share their faith confidently. The class avoids stereotyped approaches that many Christians find wooden and intimidating. Instead, you will learn how to identify and develop an evangelism style that is effective for you. The focus is on helping you to share the Gospel in a natural and powerful way while being the person God made you to be.</p>\n      <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/prophets/index.htm\"><b>The Minor Prophets</b></a> - </b>In the Old Testament, God spoke through his prophets both about his plan for the future through the Messiah, and his will for their own day. This five-week course surveys the history and message of the Minor Prophets: Hosea through Malachi. </p>\n      <p><b>Missions Mobilization</b> - Our God is a missionary God and He calls His followers to be missions mobilizers. This five-week class examines myths about missions, the Biblical basis for missions, and the implications for our lives. We will also identify who the unreached are, where they live, and what Xenos' is doing to meet their needs. </p>\n      <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/ntsurvey/index.htm\"><b>New Testament Survey</b> </a>-</b> This five-week course explores the ministry and teaching of Jesus and the expansion of the early church. We study the cultural and historical setting of the New Testament and survey the major themes of the epistles. This course offers practical insights to facilitate a solid understanding of the New Testament. The material provides an important foundation for more advanced courses that study New Testament epistles. </p>\n      <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/otsurvey/index.htm\"><b>Old Testament Survey</b></a> - </b>This five-week course traces the unfolding of god's plan through the Old testament, paying special attention to the history of ancient Israel. The course provides practical insights to increase understanding of the Old Testament. In addition, it cultivates an appreciation for the significance of this important part of Scripture. This course is open to all. It is especially helpful for Christians who are largely unfamiliar with the Old Testament, its extraordinary message, and its history. </p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/psalms/index.htm\"><b>Psalms</b></a> - \"The New Testament is in the Old Testament concealed. The Old Testament is in the New Testament revealed.\" Nowhere is this more evident than in the Psalms. This book is cited in the New Testament more than any other book of the Old Testament. The Psalms are revelation - God speaks to us through them about Himself and His plans for us. The Psalms are poetry - moving because poetry sneaks around our reluctance to feel strong emotions. The Psalms are honest - not always nice or happy, but they tell the truth about doubt during painful times. We are separated from the authors of the Psalms by more than three millennia, but they still have much to say to us. Come hear God speak through the Hebrew poets in this enlightening, stirring and challenging study. </p>\n      <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/science/index.htm\">Science and Christianity</a> </b>- This class examines a range of issues in the dialogue between secular science and Christianity, specifically the Bible. Taught by those with scientific and theological credentials, the course examines issues like creation and evolution, bioethics, intellectual history and epistemology. </p>\n      <p><b>Women In Marriage</b> - This course will emphasize the practical, and how it is that women can become better lovers of their husbands. Women who aren't yet married but are engaged would benefit from the material, but it's best applied to women who have already been working on applying these principles to their lives. </p>\n      \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Elective Courses","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/electives.htm"}

They\nspoke out against slavery, and witnessed to African Americans. Gradually,\nthousands of African Americans came to Christ and entered Methodist churches.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn24\" name=\"_ftnref24\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[24]</span></span></span></span></a>\nUnlike other denominations of that era, the Methodists were willing to give\nAfrican Americans meaningful ministry roles, including the opportunity to\npreach to blacks and whites. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">C.</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> <i>Methodists used innovative\nmethods to plant churches.</i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Methodist itinerant preachers went from settlement to settlement,\npreaching the gospel and gathering converts into congregations.

Some of these new leaders had sat under Bible teaching in an\nestablished Methodist church back east, but many had not. Circuit riders checked\nin every so often to keep young leaders and their churches from veering off\ntrack. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Older denominations like the Congregationalists were too dependent\non paid, trained clergy to work this way.

Professional clergy replaced amateur pastors.\nCircuit riders dismounted and settled into comfortable parsonages. Congregations\nthat once affirmed racial equality fell back into segregation. Pastors went to\nseminary for training. The establishment crept in. Just as in many movements\nbefore and since, energy gradually shifted away from expansion and toward\nmaintenance. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">2. <place>Calvary</place>\nChapel (1965 - Present)</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">One of the most remarkable church planting movements in recent\nhistory started in a small church called Calvary Chapel in <place><city>Costa Mesa</city>, <state>California</state></place>\n(CCCM). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">In the spring of 2008, Xenos Elder Ryan Lowery and I spent a week at\nCCCM. We met with Chuck Smith, the founding pastor, and had extended\nconversations with Carl Westerlund, the director of the Calvary Chapel School\nof Ministry, and many key staff people. Thanks to the gracious hospitality of\nour hosts, we received an insider's look at the Calvary Chapel movement. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">When Chuck Smith began leading CCCM in 1965, there were 25 people in\nattendance.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn31\" name=\"_ftnref31\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[31]</span></span></span></span></a>\nFrom this humble beginning the church has grown to over 9,500 people. It has\nalso spawned over 1,000 churches in the <place><country-region>U.S.</country-region></place> The Vineyard movement, which started\nwhen John Wimber parted ways from the Calvary Chapel movement in the 1970's,\nhas itself planted more than 550 churches.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Observations</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Seeing the Calvary Chapel movement up close for a week was a great\nexperience. During our flight back to <city><place>Columbus</place></city>,\nRyan and I took some time to discuss what struck us most about our visit:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i></i><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A. Church planting</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Church planting is a core value in the Calvary Chapel movement. The\noriginal Calvary Chapel in <place><city>Costa Mesa</city></place>\nhas planted many churches which themselves have planted additional churches. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">B. Calling</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">CCCM is always looking for individuals who have been called by God\nto start a new church. Calling is essential. \"If there is one characteristic\nthat is absolutely essential for effective ministry, it's that we must first\nhave a sense of calling-the conviction in our hearts that God has chosen and\ncalled us to serve Him.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn32\" name=\"_ftnref32\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[32]</span></span></span></span></a>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">C. Giving and receiving </span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">CCCM routinely releases the best workers in their church to start\nnew ministries. When these new leaders see their ministry flourish, the often\nreturn the favor by sending their best servants back to <city><place>Costa Mesa</place></city> for in-depth training. This\ncreates a dynamic environment at CCCM. People serving in a variety of ministry\nsettings bring back ideas and experiences that invigorate the sending church.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">D. Churches from home Bible\nstudies</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">CCCM's weekend services grew rapidly\nin the 1970s, drawing people from <place><placename>Orange</placename>\n <placetype>County</placetype></place> and surrounding\nareas. Some of these folks gathered together in homes for additional fellowship\nand Bible study. Greg Laurie, a well-known pastor in the Calvary Chapel\nmovement, took over one of these Bible studies in <city>Riverside</city>,\na two-hour drive north east of <place><city>Costa\n  Mesa</city></place>. Under his leadership, it became an independent\nchurch. Today it has well over 15,000 people!<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn33\" name=\"_ftnref33\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[33]</span></span></span></span></a>\nAdditional Calvary Chapel churches sprung up in the <city>Los\n Angeles</city> metro area, and then up and down the <state><place>California</place></state> coast. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Many of these church plants were\n\"cold starts\" where a planter and his wife start a Bible study in their home. I\nmet a man at their <place><placetype>School</placetype>\n of <placename>Ministry</placename></place> who had done\nthis. He began by forming a support group for recovering addicts. Some of the\npeople in this group were responsive to the gospel, and he discipled them. Then\nhe invited them to participate in a small Bible study to form closer\nrelationships. This small group grew and eventually became a new church. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Unlike most Xenos home churches,\nwhich multiply when they reach 30 people or so, Calvary Chapel church planters allow\ntheir groups to become 50 or 60 strong. This group becomes the core of a\nweekend service, and the original home Bible study is then broken down into\nsmaller weeknight studies to provide fellowship. Some of our current Xenos home\ngroups are located a good distance away from our large meeting locations. Perhaps\nthe leaders of some of these groups should consider growing their group into what\nwe call a \"Central Teaching\" or even a new independent church instead of simply\nmultiplying into two new home groups.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">E. Training</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Like the early Methodists, Calvary\nChapel leaders see no need to rely on seminaries to prepare pastors.\nNevertheless, ten years into the movement, Calvary Chapel opened the <placetype>School</placetype> of <placename>Ministry</placename>\nat <city>Costa Mesa</city>, and the <place><placename>Calvary</placename> <placename>Chapel</placename>\n <placename>Bible</placename> <placetype>College</placetype></place><i> </i>in nearby Murrieta. These training\nprograms are available to church planters, but they are not the engines that\ndrive church planting. Most of the church planters who went out from CCCM in\nthe 70's were trained personally by Chuck Smith. He brought them on staff to\nserve in various roles as apprentices, and met with them periodically to offer\ntraining and guidance. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">F. Financial support</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Calvary Chapel church planters\nalmost always go out with very little financial support. They have to hold a\njob down to pay their bills and feed their family. This bi-vocational\narrangement continues until the planter's congregation is large enough to pay\nhim a full time salary. They assume if God is behind the work, the planter will\nsucceed. If God isn't behind it, no amount of money will make it successful. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">As we saw with the Methodists, this\nkeeps costs down. Existing church leaders are not forced to limit the number of\nnew plants because of budgetary concerns. Once new churches are up and running,\nthey do not depend on outside support to survive.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn34\" name=\"_ftnref34\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[34]</span></span></span></span></a>\nMost denominations spend large amounts of money up front on pastor salaries and\nstart up costs.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn35\" name=\"_ftnref35\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[35]</span></span></span></span></a>\nSo <place>Calvary</place>'s approach to funding is unusual.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">G. Evangelism</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">We saw earlier that many megachurches grow primarily by attracting\npeople from dying churches. What seems like growth in the kingdom is actually\njust reshuffling the deck. But CCCM does not fit this growth pattern. They have\nmanaged to win a fair number of new converts. Before Ryan and I visited Calvary\nChapel Costa Mesa, another group from Xenos visited CCCM. After speaking with\ndozens of people, they found that about 48% of them had come to Christ through\nCCCM. This is a much higher percentage than any other church we know of outside\nour own. From what we can tell, many of the new converts were won through three\nprimary avenues: Greg Laurie's Harvest Crusades, personal evangelism by people\nin CCCM, and K-WAVE 107.9 FM, CCCM's radio station.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">H. Aversion to strategy </span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Ryan and I heard a CCCM assistant pastor warn against embracing\nspecific ministry methods. His recommendation: \"just be you and teach the\nword.\" He saw imitating another church as seeking vision from men (vs. hearing\nfrom God in your own setting). We also heard him say, \"effectiveness comes from\nfollowing God's leading, not from style, strategy, etc.,\" and, \"the greatest\nworks of God are unique works of God.\" That said, the CCCM church planting class,\nwhich we've had a chance to review, does have a few \"strategic\" sections.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn36\" name=\"_ftnref36\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[36]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">I. Broad definition of\nministry success</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">CCCM is trying to raise mature disciple of Christ who follow God's\nleading into ministry. Where that takes them varies widely (e.g. starting a\nrecovery ministry for addicts, supervising a home for troubled youth, planting\na church in <place>Eastern Europe</place>).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">J. \"Realevance\" </span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"Realevance\" is being relevant by being real. It is the opposite of\nreligion. Sometimes, in trying to be relevant, Christians become irrelevant and\nlose credibility. CCCM staff strive to avoid this, and were quick to point out,\n\"Chuck Smith never tried to be a hippy. He is who he is.\" </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">K. Bible, Bible, Bible</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">CCCM is more committed to teaching the entire Bible than most\nchurches. They teach verse by verse through books of the Bible at weekend\nservices. Most Calvary Chapel leaders have listened to the \"C2000 series,\" 300+\nsermons by Chuck Smith on every book of the Bible. Chuck's teachings were\nexpository on Sunday morning (2 Corinthians), verse-by-verse on Sunday evening\n(2 Corinthians), and more in-depth verse-by-verse on Wednesday evening (14+\nmonths in 1st John). The Sunday PM and Wednesday PM meetings were open to\nanyone. Many were growing under this teaching ministry and seeking out ways to\nserve.</span><b></b><b></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The establishment kills,\nbut the Spirit gives life</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Most Christian movements follow a predictable cycle: renewal,\ngrowth, prosperity, institutionalization, decline, sometimes renewal/sometimes\ndeath.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn37\" name=\"_ftnref37\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[37]</span></span></span></span></a>\nCalvary Chapel, at least in <city><place>Costa Mesa</place></city>,\nwas showing signs of institutionalization at the time Ryan and I visited.\nGrowth peaked there in the 70s. It has levelled off since, and even declined. One\nperson on their staff admitted that attendance at the mother church was lower\nduring the time of our visit than any time he had worked there, and he started\nin the 70s. That said, CCCM and other Calvary Chapels are still full of life\nand engaged in effective ministry. Many Methodist denominations and churches are\nmuch further along the cycle. Some may see renewal, but others have completely\nlost their way. It makes me wonder what will happen at Xenos. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">In their church planter training materials, Calvary Chapel lists\nsymptoms of institutionalization. Each symptom was exhibited by the Pharisees,\nwho were heavily entrenched in a dead religious establishment. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">1.

A survey of the New Testament reveals that church planting is <i>implied in the Great Commission</i>, <i>a natural result of the expansion of the\ngospel</i>, and <i>a deliberate strategy</i>\nemployed by Paul and others. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">1. Implied in the great\ncommission</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Just after his resurrection, Jesus commissioned his disciples to\ncarry out a great task:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">(Matthew 28:18-20) \"And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying,\n'All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. 'Go therefore and\nmake disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and\nthe Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you;\nand lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.'\" </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The main verb in this command is to make disciples. The verbs for\n\"go,\" \"baptize,\" and \"teach\" are participles that explain what making disciples\ninvolves. In the book of Acts we see how the first Christians carried out this\nprocess. Peter went to the temple precinct to preach the gospel. When listeners\nreceived the good news, they were baptized. Luke says new Christians were\n\"added to their number\" or literally, \"added together\" (Acts 2:47). In other\nwords, converts were not saved in isolation, but rather brought into community.\nThese growing disciples \"devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship,\nto the breaking of bread and to prayer\" (Acts 2:42). They received training in\nthe context of Christian fellowship.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Jesus always envisioned his disciples growing in love together.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn48\" name=\"_ftnref48\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[48]</span></span></span></span></a>\nLearning to obey Christ was never meant to be an individual endeavor. Paul said\nit was only \"as each part does its own special work\" that the \"whole body is\nhealthy and growing and full of love.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn49\" name=\"_ftnref49\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[49]</span></span></span></span></a>\nThis is the environment disciples need in order to grow. Therefore Jesus'\ncommand to make disciples requires the establishment of a community of\nChristians, a church.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"Jesus' command [the Great Commission] instructed his listeners to\nevangelize and to gather the new believers into local congregations where they\ncould be discipled, baptized and taught. In that setting, the process of their\ngrowth would occur.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn50\" name=\"_ftnref50\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[50]</span></span></span></span></a><b></b></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">2. A natural result of the\nexpansion of the Gospel</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The first few chapters of Acts do not reveal a deliberate plan to\nform new churches. But we do see people receiving the gospel and associating in\ngroups to follow Christ together. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A. Small gatherings</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The first assembly of Christ-followers met in the upstairs room of a\nhouse where the apostles lived. This assembly included the apostles, less\nJudas, the brothers of Jesus, Jesus' mom, and many others-about 120 believers total.\nThis early group was \"of one mind\" (Acts 1:14) and \"continually devoted to\nprayer\" (Acts 1:14) as they gathered to hear the apostles speak (Acts 1:15ff).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Originally, this single gathering of Christians in <city><place>Jerusalem</place></city> comprised the entire church. \"On\nthe day of Pentecost,\" Luke says \"<i>all </i>the\nbelievers were meeting together in one place.\" (Acts 2:1)</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Then the Holy Spirit came, as Jesus promised, and the number of\nbelievers in this original group grew quickly. The Holy Spirit empowered Peter\nto preach the gospel, and thousands of people were converted (Acts 2:41).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">This now enormous congregation broke down into smaller groups to\nshare meals and take communion in private homes (Acts 2:46). Luke doesn't\nmention any deliberate plan to bring this about. These home gatherings probably\nformed spontaneously through friendship and family ties. Since there were\nthousands of believers, there must have been hundreds of gatherings like this.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">B. Persecution and\nitinerant preaching.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Jewish authorities began persecuting Christians in <city><place>Jerusalem</place></city>, forcing many to leave (Acts 7;\n8:1-4). These Christians preached the gospel as they travelled to new places.\nPhilip is given as a prime example. He started preaching in \"the city of <city><place>Samaria</place></city>\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn51\" name=\"_ftnref51\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[51]</span></span></span></span></a>\n(Acts 8:5). Luke says that many believed and were baptized there (Acts 8:5-24).\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Probably hundreds of Christians like Philip left <place><city>Jerusalem</city></place> to flee persecution. Many of them\nshared their faith in Christ as they went (Acts 8:1,4), making converts in the\nvillages of Judea and <place><city>Samaria</city></place>.\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">C. Association. </span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">New believers who heard Philip preach in <place><city>Samaria</city></place> associated in crowds at first. They listened\nand watched Philip perform miracles \"with one accord\" (Acts 8:6). They also\nassembled together when Peter and John arrived to give them the gift of the\nHoly Spirit (Acts 8:14-17).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Converts in other locations also gathered into small communities.\nThere was a group of \"disciples at <place><city>Damascus</city></place>\"\n(Acts 9:2,10,19) before Paul ever arrived. Cornelius' relatives and close\nfriends in <place>Caesarea</place> formed another Christian\ncommunity. At Lydda there were a number of Christians (\"saints\" in Acts 9:32).\nThere was also community of disciples at <place><city>Sharon</city></place>\n(Acts 9:35) and Joppa (Acts 9:38). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Luke never tells us how these Christians came to associate with each\nother. Christians in various locations probably sought each other out for friendship\nand support. Whatever the reason, the result was the formation of churches,\nsmall assemblies of believers. <b></b></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">3. A deliberate strategy\nemployed by Paul and others.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Luke's description of Paul's ministry in the middle of Acts reveals\na more developed approach to planting new churches. Read Acts 14:21-23. Notice\nthat Paul and Barnabas' work starts with \"preaching\" to make \"disciples\" (Acts 14:21)\nand ends with \"churches\" (Acts 14:23). Let's break down the steps involved. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A. First, they \"<b>preached the gospel.</b>\"</span></i><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn52\" name=\"_ftnref52\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[52]</span></span></span></span></span></a><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">B. Next, they<b> \"made disciples.\"</b></span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> They met together with young converts for prayer, communion and\nBible study. At this stage, a local church was born.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">C. Then they<b> \"returned,\"</b></span></i><b></b><span lang=\"EN-CA\">which implies they were gone for a while.<b> </b>After letting the new church develop a life of its own, they came\nback to check its progress and to urge believers in it to continue following\nChrist. Luke repeatedly says they did this by \"strengthening and encouraging\" the\nbrethren (Acts 15:32,41; 18:23).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">D. Finally, they \"<b>appointed elders.\"</b></span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> The norm was to appoint more than one, or a \"plurality,\" of elders\nto oversee each church.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn53\" name=\"_ftnref53\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[53]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">We can't reduce the complex story of church planting in the New\nTestament to a simple script, but we can recognize in each of these activities\nan essential component of the church planting process. Let's take a closer look\nat each one. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A. Preaching the gospel</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The Holy Spirit sent Paul and Barnabas on a preaching tour of <place>Asia Minor</place> (Acts 13:1-3). During this first \"missionary\njourney,\" they went from town to town like Methodist circuit riders \"proclaiming\nthe word of God\" (Acts 13:2,5). They preached the gospel in Psidian Antioch,\nIconium, and Lystra. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">On these visits and on subsequent trips, Paul began by preaching to\nthe Jews, usually in a local synagogue.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn54\" name=\"_ftnref54\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[54]</span></span></span></span></a>\nIf there was no synagogue in town, he tried to meet Jews who lived there and\nshared the Gospel with them (see \"place of prayer\" in Acts 16:13). Converts won\nthrough these initial contacts already knew each other and easily formed the\nnucleus of a church.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">In <place><city>Athens</city></place>,\nwhere no synagogue is mentioned, Paul managed to work his way into a different\nsocial network. He spoke with Epicurean and Stoic philosophers, and was\neventually given the opportunity to preach the gospel to their philosophical\nsociety at the Areopagus. Converts he won there also had a natural affinity for\neach other (Acts 17:32-34).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">When Peter arrived at <place>Caesarea</place> to\nmeet Cornelius, he introduced the gospel to yet another social network:\nCornelius' extended family and friends. They met in Cornelius' home to hear\nPeter speak. Like Jews in a synagogue, or the society of philosophers in <city><place>Athens</place></city>, they already had strong\nsocial ties. No one would have to encourage them to gather together as a\nchurch.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">IMPLICATION: These examples suggest that church planters should\nlearn how people organize themselves in the communities they are trying to\nreach. Then they should find away to get the gospel into these social networks\nso converts will already have relational ties with each other. In <place>North Linden</place>, suburban social networks (schools, the work\nplace, sports leagues) are either broken or non-existent. The two primary\norganizing structures we've found are gangs and large numbers of people living\nunder the same roof. We haven't done much work among gangs. But we are seeing\nsome success simply entering people's homes and bringing the gospel into their\nsocial setting. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">B. Making disciples</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The act of preaching the gospel is closely associated with making\ndisciples (Acts 5:42-6:1; 6:7; 14:21). When people responded to the gospel\nmessage by turning to God and asking for forgiveness, they became disciples of\nChrist (Acts 18:27). Paul worked hard to thoroughly ground these new disciples\nin the word. Whether his stay in a particular town was short or long, he used\nevery opportunity to equip believers. During a brief visit at <place>Troas</place>,\nhe taught all night (Acts 20:7,11). Despite being at Thessalonica no more than\na month,<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn55\" name=\"_ftnref55\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[55]</span></span></span></span></a>\nhe taught the Christians there extensively and sent Timothy to provide\nadditional instruction.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn56\" name=\"_ftnref56\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[56]</span></span></span></span></a>\nAt <city>Ephesus</city>, Paul \"reasoned daily in the <place><placetype>school</placetype> of <placename>Tyrannus</placename></place>\" (Acts 19:9), taught \"publicly\nand from house to house,\" (Acts 20:20), and \"for three years <i>never stopped</i> warning <i>each</i> of them <i>night and day</i> with tears.\" (Acts 20:31)</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">IMPLICATION: Church planters should imitate the strong emphasis on gospel\npreaching and training in Paul's ministry. They ought to have a plan in place\nfrom the outset to teach people in their new church \"the whole purpose of God.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn57\" name=\"_ftnref57\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[57]</span></span></span></span></a>\nThis plan should include a provision for in-depth training that goes beyond\nwhat is covered in weekly services.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">C. Returning, overseeing,\nand encouraging</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">On his way to planting new churches, Paul returned to existing ones\nto check on their progress (Acts 15:36). During these visits, Paul devoted his\ntime to teaching and exhortation. The goal of his instruction was to love and\nbuild up his listeners. When necessary, he also disciplined wayward Christians\nand corrected false teaching.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn58\" name=\"_ftnref58\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[58]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Of course, Paul could only visit one church at a time. To provide\nadequate oversight for his growing network of churches, he relied on dozens of\ncoworkers to gather information and relay his instructions. Paul's ability to\nform these coworkers into a team of like-minded servants is an often overlooked\nkey to the success of his church planting ministry.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"In\nhis friends [Paul] was able to call forth a devotion which knew no limits.\nPriscilla and <place>Aquila</place> risked their lives for\nhim in a dangerous situation (Rom. 16:3 ff.). Epaphroditus of Philippi\novertaxed his strength and suffered an almost fatal illness in his anxiety to\nbe of service to the imprisoned apostle (Phil. 2:25-20). Timothy readily\nsurrendered whatever personal ambitions he might have cherished in order to\nplay the part of a son to Paul and help him in his missionary activity, showing\na selfless concern for others that matched the apostle's own eagerness to spend\nand be spent for them (Phil. 2:19-20).\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn59\" name=\"_ftnref59\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[59]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Without the help of his team, Paul could never have overseen so many\nchurches. His friends provided him with critically needed financial support (1\nCor. 16:17), comfort (2 Cor. 7:6), and protection (Acts 9:25). Together with\nPaul they prayed for the welfare of each of their churches (Phil. 1:3-11; Col.\n4:12). They also taught local congregations, corrected false teaching, opposed\nbad influences in the church, and encouraged believers to remain true to the\ngospel.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn60\" name=\"_ftnref60\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[60]</span></span></span></span></a>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">IMPLICATION: If you want to plant a network of churches, the\nchurches you start will need oversight. And to give them proper oversight, you'll\nneed help. Even if you hope to found a church and stay to pastor it, you'll\nneed to build a team of people around you in order to succeed. The importance\nof team building in church planting is confirmed by research: </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"70\npercent... of all churches beginning with a committed core group became\nself-supporting... Those churches started without a committed core group had a\n38 percent... success rate.

He loved them, esteemed them, and appreciated their service.\nPerhaps this is why he \"attracted friends around him as a magnet attracts iron\nfilings.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn62\" name=\"_ftnref62\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[62]</span></span></span></span></a>\nAsk God to give you the same love and affection for your partners in ministry.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">D. Appointing elders<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn63\" name=\"_ftnref63\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><b><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[63]</span></b></span></span></span></a>\n</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">To solidify their gains on their first missionary journey, Paul and Barnabas\nappointed elders in \"every church\" (Acts 14:23). They installed these elders\nafter each church had existed for awhile. Elder appointments were preceded by a\ntime of prayer and fasting, presumably to seek God's wisdom regarding whom to select.\nThen Paul and Barnabas put them before God for consideration as servants (\"commended\nthem to the Lord\", Acts 4:23). Ultimately it was the job of the Holy Spirit to\ndetermine who should lead (Acts 20:28). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">In his own life, Paul pointed to the fruit of his labor as God's\nstamp of approval on his ministry (2 Cor. 3:1,2). He and Barnabas likely looked\nfor similar evidence to identify who was fit to serve as an elder. Character and\ncompetence in the word (1 Tim. 3; Titus 1), faith, being Spirit-filled (Acts 6:5),\nand having a good reputation (Acts 16:2) were also important factors.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">IMPLICATION: Churches can form in the absence of leadership. But they\nshould be led whenever possible. In Titus 1, Paul insists that churches on <place>Crete</place> be in good order with qualified leadership. When\nchurch planters start a church, if they don't plan to lead for the long term,\nthey should appoint one or preferably more than one leader. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">IMPLICATION: Prospective church planters should seriously consider\nnot just going and starting a single church, but going to several places and\nstarting several churches! This is the approach Paul took. There is nothing\nwrong with starting a church and staying long term to lead it. We have at least\none example in the New Testament of a Christian worker who did just that.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn64\" name=\"_ftnref64\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[64]</span></span></span></span></a>\nBut Paul and the Methodists have shown the tremendous fruit that can be born through\na more mobile approach. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Conclusion</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">What does the Bible say about church planting? Planting churches is\nconsistent with the great commission. Churches emerged wherever the gospel\nspread, showing Jesus' commitment to build his church. Church planting was not isolated\nactivity. Paul planted churches almost everywhere he went. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"The life of Paul and the action of the early church demonstrate\nthat church planting was a primary activity. Any church wishing to rediscover\nthe dynamic nature of the early church should consider planting new churches.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn65\" name=\"_ftnref65\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[65]</span></span></span></span></a>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">So the New Testament provides ample support for making church\nplanting a key emphasis in our ministry. We'd be foolish not to employ such an\neffective strategy for carrying out the Great Commission. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Week 2</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Are you cut out to plant a\nchurch?</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">If you're interested in planting a new church, it's natural to ask\nyourself, am I cut out for it? Am I the kind of person who could/should do\nsomething like that? Hopefully anyone interested in planting a church would\nhave the humility to wonder about this.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Fortunately, God can use people with a broken, sinful past to build\nhis church (1 Tim. 1:15). Anyone who has read the story of English pastor John\nNewton<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn66\" name=\"_ftnref66\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[66]</span></span></span></span></a>\nknows what God can do through a sinful person who once was far from him. God\ndelights to do great work through the most unlikely people-this is how he\ndemonstrates his power and glory.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">That said, church planting isn't for everyone. To get a better feel\nfor what church planters are like are what they do, we'll start by considering\nPaul's reflections on his own role as a church planter. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Exercise:</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> Have half the room read Acts 20:17-38 and the other half read 1\nThessalonians 2:1-12. Ask students to make observations in two broad\ncategories: What are church planters like (character qualities)? What do they\ndo? Ask them to tie their observations to the text. Write down what they say on\na whiteboard. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Now that we gave a good profile of what a church planter is like,\nlet's turn our attention to four important areas that will help us determine\nwhether God would have you plant a church: character, consecration, gifting,\nand calling.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">1. The importance of\ncharacter and competence in the word</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The early church commissioned men to plant churches with exemplary\ncharacter who were known by their congregations to be fully committed to Christ\nand gifted to teach the word. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Consider Barnabas. He was generous (Acts 4:36,37), an encourager, a\ngood man full of the Holy Spirit and faith (Acts 11:22-24), and a prophet who\ntaught the word (\"they\" in Acts 11:26; Acts 13:1). </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Timothy was spoken well of by people who know him (Acts 16:2). He\n  was a faithful (1 Cor. 4:17) worker who could strengthen and encourage others\n  (1 Thes. 3:2). He also had teaching-related gifting (1 Tim. 1:18.19; 2 Tim.\n  1:6-8; 2 Tim. 4:5).</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Church planters like Barnabas and Timothy are the DNA of the\nchurches they plant, the founding pattern that others will follow. If deacons\nmust first be tested (1 Tim. 3:10), if elders must be able to teach (1 Tim.\n3:2), if the church should not make a new convert an elder (1 Tim. 3:6) nor\nappoint an elder \"too hastily\" (1 Tim. 5:22), the same is true of a church\nplanter. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Church planters should be \"proven\" in the local church first. If\nthey aren't currently loving anyone (the true measure of character), then their\nefforts to plant a church won't amount to much (1 Cor. 13:3). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Even when the church was looking to fill less visible roles, they\nsought people who had a good reputation with outsiders, who were filled with\nthe Spirit, who were wise (which implies knowledge of the word), and who were\nresponsible (Acts 6:3). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">IMPLICATION: Church planters should have similar qualities. Ideally,\nthey would satisfy the requirements of deacons and elders listed in 1 Timothy 3\nand Titus 1. God isn't limited to these guidelines, and he may, at times,\nchoose to use someone who \"grows into the job.\" But local churches who are\nattempting to identify and send church planters should prefer candidates who\nmeet these qualifications.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"For both types of ministry [pastoring and church planting] there is\none basic essential: spiritual integrity... Christian leaders lead first and\nforemost through their mature character.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn67\" name=\"_ftnref67\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[67]</span></span></span></span></a></span><i></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">2. Consecration</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Before considering what specific ministry God may be directing you\ntowards, it's good to reflect on who you are in relation to him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">(1 Cor. 5:19,20) \"Or do you not know that your body is a temple of\nthe Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not\nyour own? For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your\nbody.\"</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">God owns you, and you exist to glorify him. Watchman Nee explains:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"Once we have made the discovery of the fact that we are the\ndwelling-place of God, then a full surrender of ourselves to God must follow...\nThe difference between victorious Christians and defeated ones is not that some\nhave the Spirit while others have not, but that some... recognize the divine\nownership of their lives while others are still their own masters.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn68\" name=\"_ftnref68\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[68]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Before we seek to do a great work for God, we should first turn our\nlives over to him to direct us. This kind of \"all in\" attitude is a\nprerequisite for anyone who would plant a church. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"He is not calling us to devote ourselves to his cause: he is asking\nus to yield ourselves unconditionally to his will. Are you prepared for that?\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn69\" name=\"_ftnref69\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[69]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">What if God's plans for you don't involve church planting? How will\nyou respond? Our first priority is to make ourselves available to God for the\nwork he has for us. If God does want you to plant a church, an attitude of full\nsurrender, of embracing your identity as God's slave, will help you hang in there\nwhen the work is difficult. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"The one who is called to preach, and answers that call, must give\nup his entire life for the service to His Lord. There can be no\nmisunderstanding at this point. Going into the ministry will not cost you\nsomething; it will not cost you dearly; it will cost you your life and\neverything in it!

But the terms\n\"apostle\" and \"apostolic gifting\" can be confusing. What is the gift of\napostleship? Do church planters really need to have it? If so, how can we\nrecognize when someone is a gifted apostle?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">In the New Testament, the word apostle is used as a title <i>and</i> to describe a spiritual gift.\nApostle (Gk, \"apostolos\") simply means \"messenger,\" which captures the essence\nof what apostles do. They take God's message to places where it hasn't been\nheard and proclaim it.

These \"foundational\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn79\" name=\"_ftnref79\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[79]</span></span></span></span></a>\napostles spoke for God and wrote down the revelation they received in letters\nto churches.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn80\" name=\"_ftnref80\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[80]</span></span></span></span></a>\nThey were also involved in church planting. Peter and Paul are obvious\nexamples, but church tradition indicates that the other apostles planted\nchurches as well.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn81\" name=\"_ftnref81\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[81]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The New Testament mentions additional Christian workers called\napostles (Rom. 16:7; 2 Cor. 8:22,23; Phil 2:25) who taught God's word and\ncollaborated with the foundational apostles to plant churches. Luke calls Barnabas\nan apostle<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn82\" name=\"_ftnref82\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[82]</span></span></span></span></a> and\nexplains how he planted churches with Paul on his first missionary journey.\nPaul also called Titus an apostle.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn83\" name=\"_ftnref83\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[83]</span></span></span></span></a>\nHe assisted Paul in planting churches in <place>Crete</place>.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn84\" name=\"_ftnref84\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[84]</span></span></span></span></a>\nThese individuals shared the same title and gifting as the foundational\napostles, but their message did not carry the same authority. What they taught\nhad to be consistent with the teaching of Paul and the original apostles.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn85\" name=\"_ftnref85\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[85]</span></span></span></span></a>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The New Testament descriptions of apostles just cited show a\nconnection between apostleship and church planting. This may be why Paul lists\napostleship first in his list of spiritual gifts (1 Cor. 12:28). People gifted\nas apostles today are engaged in the same kind of work, but like Titus and Barnabas,\nthey teach and serve under the authority of the original apostles.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">How can we identify people that God has empowered to be an apostle?\nUnfortunately, the Bible doesn't provide a test. All we have to go on are\ndescriptions of what apostles are like and what they do. To the observations we\nmade in our discussion of Acts 20:17-38 and 1 Thes. 2:1-12, we can add these\ntwo characteristics:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A. Starting a new ministry\nfrom scratch:</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> In 1 Cor. 9:2, Paul cites the\nexistence of the church at <place><city>Corinth</city></place>\nas \"the seal\" of his \"apostleship in the Lord.\" In other words, the Corinthian\nchurch itself, which he planted, was visible evidence of Paul's apostleship.\nNotice that Paul's work at <city><place>Corinth</place></city>\ninvolved more than preaching the gospel. Paul was empowered by God to establish\nconverts into loving Christian community. This suggests that the ability to\nstart a new work where nothing has existed before is a sign of apostolic\ngifting.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">B. A mixture of toughness\nand dependence on God</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> (2 Cor. 11:12, 23-28; 2 Cor.\n11:30; 12:9): When Paul defends his apostleship in 2 Cor. 10-12, a strange\nparadox emerges. On the one hand, Paul is clearly a tough, tenacious, hard\nworker who has learned how to serve God through very difficult circumstances. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">(2\nCor. 11:17) Are they servants of Christ?-I speak as if insane-I more so; in far\nmore labors, in far more imprisonments, beaten times without number, often in\ndanger of death. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">On the other hand, we see a man who is fully aware of his own weakness\nand limitations.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">(2\nCor 11:30) If I have to boast, I will boast of what pertains to my\nweakness.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">(2\nCor 12:9) And He has said to me, \"My grace is sufficient for you, for power is\nperfected in weakness.\" Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast about my\nweaknesses.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Paul's toughness was not just an extension of his temperament or\npersonality. God empowered him to serve through tremendous adversity, and he\nknew it. God seems to give apostles like Paul resilience and staying power.\nObservers watching an apostle should see someone who (a) isn't a quitter, who\ncan handle setbacks, and who isn't scared away by opposition, and (b) has an\nongoing awareness of their need to depend on God.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn86\" name=\"_ftnref86\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[86]</span></span></span></span></a>\n<i></i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Along with these positive characteristics, the Bible also gives us\nways to recognize false apostles. True apostles like Paul and John told\nbelievers to look for these warning signs: </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Teaching that does not cohere\nwith doctrines taught by the \"foundational\" apostles (2 Cor. 11:4), which we\nnow have recorded for us in the New Testament.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Status seeking (2 Cor. 11:12). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Dishonesty (2 Cor. 11:13).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Moral compromise (\"evil\" in Rev\n2:2). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Before we leave the subject of apostolic gifting, a quick word about\npastors. In Ephesians 4:11, Paul makes a distinction between \"apostles\" and\n\"pastors.\" That's because pastors and apostles have different job descriptions.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A pastor shepherds the flock.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn87\" name=\"_ftnref87\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[87]</span></span></span></span></a>\nShepherding is one of the main responsibilities of the elders of the local\nchurch (Acts 20:28, 1 Peter 5:2). Pastors shepherd by setting a good example (1\nPeter 5:2), and by protecting their flock from \"wolves\" who spread false\nteaching (Acts 20:28). Of course, this requires that pastors themselves teach.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn88\" name=\"_ftnref88\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[88]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Church planters with the gift of apostleship must also be able to\npastor and teach. We saw this when Paul described his initial work with the\nThessalonians.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn89\" name=\"_ftnref89\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[89]</span></span></span></span></a>\nBut church planters must do more. They have to start something where nothing\nexists. This requires a willingness and ability to <i>go</i> to a new location (2 Cor. 8:17; \"frequent journeys\" 2 Cor.\n11:26; Phil 2:28; 2 Tim. 4:10), and a drive/calling to start <i>new</i> works in a <i>new</i> places (Acts 9:15; Rom. 15:20). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Pastors function well within an existing ministry. People with\napostolic gifting thrive in an unscripted environment. They can develop a vision\nfor a new ministry and begin working toward it. Of course, this doesn't just\ncome from an entrepreneurial personality. God empowers them and infuses them\nwith his vision to start a new work. Have you ever started a Bible study that\nwasn't part of an existing ministry where people came to Christ and grew with\nthe Lord? That is probably the most telling sign of apostolic gifting!</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">IMPLICATIONS: </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A. <i>The gift of apostleship is\nclosely tied to church planting, therefore we should prefer church planters who\nhave apostolic gifting. </i>Daniel Sinclair notes, \"In my observations over the\npast twenty-two years of working with pioneer church planting teams, if a team\nlacks apostolic gifts (that is, no one on the team seems to have that <i>breakthrough </i>type of apostolic gifting),\nthen they are rarely very effective.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn90\" name=\"_ftnref90\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[90]</span></span></span></span></a>\nThis has proven true in Xenos' foreign missions work. The teams we have sent\nout that have lacked apostolic gifting have not fared well. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">B. <i>While we're looking for\nsigns of apostolic gifting, we should also pay attention to obvious\ndisqualifiers.</i> Character is our first consideration (1 Cor 13:1-3).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">C. Being an effective pastor/home group leader does not necessarily\nmean you are well-suited to plant a church. Pastoring and church planting are different\nskill sets. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">D. Being involved in a church planting effort doesn't require\napostolic gifting. Paul needed a supporting cast to be effective. You can make\na major contribution to a church planting effort, even if you don't have the\ngift of apostleship. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">4. Calling</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">We are all responsible to make disciples (Matt. 28:18-20). And the\nworld needs new churches where disciples can grow. Does that mean every\nChristian has a mandate from God to plant a new church? Obviously some are not\nqualified because of moral failure, and others don't know the Bible well. But\nwhat about individuals who have good character and sound knowledge of the word?\nCan they assume God would endorse their efforts to plant a new church? Most\nchurch planting experts would say \"no.\" They insist that individuals must be\n\"called\" by God to this work. In the absence of a call, they would advise\nagainst attempting to plant a church.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Is there biblical evidence that calling is this important? Certainly\nthere are some ministries that every Christian should engage in, like\nevangelism and encouragement. But there are other ministries that are only for\na few. Paul asks, \"All are not apostles are they? All are not prophets are\nthey? All are not teachers?\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn91\" name=\"_ftnref91\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[91]</span></span></span></span></a>\nThe assumed answer is \"no.\" Paul states this same concept in positive terms\nwhen he affirms that God has uniquely designed and gifted Christians for\nspecific ministry roles.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn92\" name=\"_ftnref92\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[92]</span></span></span></span></a>\nBecause of the close association between apostolic gifting and church planting,\nmost would argue that church planting is one of those ministries that is for\nsome, not all.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Let's look at situations where individuals were called to specific\nministry roles to see if we can learn what happens when God calls someone to a\nparticular ministry. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A. Judas' replacement:</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> The first Christians agreed on potential candidates to replace\nJudas and asked the Holy Spirit to narrow down their selection.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">(Acts\n1:23-26) \"So <i>they</i> [the brethren] put\nforward two men, Joseph called Barsabbas (who was also called Justus), and\nMatthias. And they prayed and said, 'You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men,\nshow which one of these two You have chosen to occupy this ministry and\napostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.' And they\ndrew lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias; and he was added to the\neleven apostles.\"</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">B. Paul:</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> God called Paul to be an apostle (Rom. 1:1; 1 Cor. 1:1; Gal.\n1:15,16, etc.). But he announced Paul's call to Ananias (Acts 9:11,12), and\nAnanias confirmed Paul's call by laying hands on him (Acts 9:17).

Judas (Barsabbus) and\nSilas:</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> The church at <place><city>Jerusalem</city></place> selected these \"leading men among\nthe brethren\" who were prophets to accompany Paul and Barnabas (Acts\n15:22-27,32). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">F. John Mark and Silas:</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> These men became involved in church planting after Barnabas and\nPaul parted ways. Barnabas insisted on taking along John Mark (Acts 15:39).\nPaul recruited Silas (Acts 15:40). Both had the support of the believers at <city><place>Antioch</place></city> (Acts 15:40b). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">G. Timothy:</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> Paul recruited Timothy to be on his church planting team (Acts\n16:1). He was \"well spoken of by the brethren who were at Lystra and Iconium\"\n(Acts 16:2). Paul linked Timothy's teaching and leading to prophecies spoken\nabout him (1 Tim. 1:18), presumably by Spirit-filled Christians whom God used\nto confirm his calling. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">H. Seven men of good\nreputation:</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> The congregation of disciples in <place><city>Jerusalem</city></place> selected seven\nmen to serve tables who had a good reputation and who were filled with the\nSpirit and with wisdom (Acts 6:2,3).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">I. The leaders of new\nchurches:</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> We saw earlier how, after a time of\nprayer and fasting, Paul and Barnabas appointed leaders in the churches they\nstarted on their first missionary journey (14:23).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">In most of these situations, two parties are involved in the\nselection of individuals for ministry: the Holy Spirit and the local church.\nThis leads us to the following definition of a call: <i>The Holy Spirit working through the Body of Christ to set apart an\nindividual for a specific ministry role.</i> </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">IMPLICATIONS:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A.</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> If you want to plant a church, that's good. Paul encourages\nChristians to aspire to serve in leading roles (\"If any man aspires to the\noffice of overseer, it is a fine work he desires to do.\", 1 Tim. 3:1). But we\nshould also <i>recognize God's role in the\nselection process.</i> Paul told the elders at <city><place>Ephesus</place></city> to shepherd \"the flock, among which\nthe Holy Spirit has <i>made you</i>\noverseers\" (Acts 20:28). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">B. Lean against your\nAmerican tendency to think and act as an individual.</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> Aspiring church planters would do well to reflect on this\nobservation by Scott Thomas:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"While\nwestern culture promotes and encourages the personal call and entrepreneurial\nspirit of the planter, the New Testament by contrast stresses the corporate\ninitiatives of congregations in selecting suitable people for Gospel ministry.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn94\" name=\"_ftnref94\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[94]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Having become convinced that a call is indeed important, many\naspiring church planters agonize over whether or not they have truly been\ncalled by God. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"Many... are... wondering and questioning the whole matter. In the\nprocess, the enemy would seek to convince that it is all your doing, your\ndesire, your imagination, just your pride! After all, why would God call you to\nthe ministry? And to even entertain the thought just proves your own arrogance!\nEvery one who is genuinely called will go through this and must work through\nthis until it is personally resolved.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn95\" name=\"_ftnref95\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[95]</span></span></span></span></a>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"It is like the farmer who was plowing in his field when God called.\nHe saw the clouds in the sky form the letters G P C, which he understood to\nmean, 'Go, preach Christ!'

Here are a few. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A. Through other people</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">. Because of the Bible's strong emphasis on the corporate nature of\nour call to ministry, it's vitally important, if you're feeling called to plant\na church, that you talk about it with people who know you. Ask them what they\nthink. Do they agree that you are well-suited to start a new church? If God has\nplaced a desire on your heart to start a new work, he is likely speaking to\nother believers about it as well. Pray with them and seek clarity and direction\nfrom God. We should value the affirmation and support of our local church when\nassessing the validity of our call.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">B. By putting a similar\nburden on someone else's heart. </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">If God is leading\nyou to plant a church, he will probably put people in your life who are\ncaptured by the same vision and want to help. God often deploys his servants in\nteams. Jesus sent his disciples out two-by-two (Luke 10:1). God called Barnabas\n<i>and </i>Paul (Acts 13:1-3). And even\nafter they split, both men showed their aversion to serving solo by immediately\nseeking out new ministry companions (Acts 15:39,40). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">C. Through your past\nministry experience. </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Paul pointed to the fruit of\nhis labor as visible evidence of his commendation by God (2 Cor. 3:1,2). He and\nBarnabas likely looked for similar evidence to identify who was fit to serve as\nan elder. What has happened in your past ministry? Have you started a new work\nbefore? Did God use it to change lives (1 Cor. 9:2)?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">D. Through your own burdens\nand desires. </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">If your call is genuine, you're\nprobably feeling an inward desire (Phil 2:13) to do the kinds of things that\nchurch planters do, like starting something new in a new place, preaching the\nword and deeply investing in other people. Do you have those desires? </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">E. By providing\nopportunities.</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> Having an opportunity to do\nsomething doesn't mean you are called to do it.But God will open doors (<state><place>Col</place></state>\n4:2-4) and put opportunities in front of us that are consistent with what he\nwants us to do. God gave Paul and Apollos opportunity to conduct their\npreaching ministry (1 Cor. 3:5). Paul realized his desire to stay with the\nCorinthians was contingent on God allowing it (16:5-7). What open doors are\nbefore you in your current situation?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">As you ponder the ways God confirms his calling, don't forget to watch\nout for these red flags.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A. Sometimes we can mistake\na strong desire to leave an unpleasant situation for a call.</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> Our desire to leave our present post could be due to a variety of\nfactors:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Some people are temperamentally predisposed to being restless. Being\nbored and wanting to try something new is not a good reason to start a church. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Others may be running away from problems. Maybe you're disappointed\nwith your friendships. Maybe you have a point of contention with God (e.g. an\nunwillingness to forgive someone who hurt you). Or perhaps it is difficult to see\nhow your present ministry will ever bear fruit. Planting a church may be an\nattractive new venture, but it won't make these problems go away. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Sometimes we've been embarrassed, and aren't happy with how we're\nperceived by other people. A new start may seem attractive, but our character\nflaws won't be changed by leaving. Wherever we go, our flaws will follow. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">B. Some people see church\nplanting as a way to make a name for themselves. </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">We've\nall heard the success stories: a visionary church planter starts with a handful\nof people and a dream. After years of hard work, the small flock grows into an\nenormous church. Book deals and speaking tours follow. It all sounds very\nappealing, but rarely happens. Most pastors will spend the best part of their\nlives faithfully serving the people God has entrusted to them in relative\nobscurity. If you're looking for fame and high visibility, you've picked the\nwrong profession. Your \"call\" is just a self serving attempt to build a sense\nof self worth on a shaky foundation. God is already delighted to call you his\nchild! Your name is written in the book of life.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn97\" name=\"_ftnref97\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[97]</span></span></span></span></a>\nIsn't that enough? </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"We\nmust be aware of identifying with our ministry and making it a functional\nsalvation and an extension of ourselves. Until we see this, we may be in the\nshort term successful, but also driven, scared, and either too timid or too\nbrash-until we see what we are doing. We are clashing our cymbals.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn98\" name=\"_ftnref98\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[98]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Being convinced that God (not your flesh) is calling you to plant a\nchurch is important. Church planting is difficult work. Many church planters\nreport that during low points, knowing God called them to their ministry kept\nthem going:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"I don't see how anyone could survive in the ministry if he felt it\nwas just his own choice. Some ministers scarcely have two good days back to\nback. They are sustained by the knowledge that God has placed them where they\nare. Ministers without such a conviction often lack courage and carry their\nresignation letter in their coat pocket. At the slightest hint of difficulty, they're\ngone.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn99\" name=\"_ftnref99\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[99]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Because of this, Paul urged Timothy to draw on his own calling for motivation\nto \"fight the good fight\" in the face of opposition (1 Tim. 1:18,19). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">If you are convinced God wants you to plant a church, here are two\nfinal words of advice. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A. It's important to share\nthe vision God has given you with other people. But in your interactions with\nothers, be aware that overemphasizing your call may have undesirable\nconsequences. </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Chuck Smith warns, </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"Emphasizing\na call to the ministry tends to exaggerate the distinction between clergy and\nlaity.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn100\" name=\"_ftnref100\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[100]</span></span></span></span></a> </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Even as you share that you've been called by God to plant a church,\nkeep stressing that every believer is a minister of God, and that God has a\nspecific ministry role in mind for each person. God is calling everyone to\nsignificant levels of service, even if they haven't had a \"<street><address>Damascus Road</address></street>\" experience, and even if\ntheir calling doesn't involve church planting.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">B.</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> It's also important to remember that <i>unlike the Word, which has objective authority, your call is\nsubjective.</i> Sometimes Christians think they are called when they aren't. We\ncould cite numerous contemporary examples of people who were \"called\" to\nministries for which the later proved to be ill-suited. Francis Schaeffer\nstrikes the right balance of confidence and humility regarding his call:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"When\nthe Lord led my wife and myself to begin L'Abri, the leading was so clear that\nnot to have moved forward would have been disobedience. And yet if you had\nasked me at that time if I was as sure of this as I was that which Scripture\ntaught, I could not have said yes. But as the years have passed there is no\ndoubt that we did understand the leading of the Lord [in beginning L'Abri].\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn101\" name=\"_ftnref101\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[101]</span></span></span></span></a>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Characteristics of\nunsuccessful church planters</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">When a church plant fails, it's often difficult to diagnose what\nwent wrong. Some people think they are called when they are not. Others are truly\ncalled, but their church plant fails for other reasons. Todd Hunter, the former\nNational Director for the Association of Vineyard Churches, prepared an\n\"autopsy report\" of 22 failed church plants. He focused his research on the characteristics\neach church planter. He came up with the following profile of a church planter\nwho is likely to fail:<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn102\" name=\"_ftnref102\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[102]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">1.

Uses ineffective methods\nof evangelism, and is unwilling to be ruthless at evaluating the results of\nthose methods (77%). </span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">3. Has no clear plan and\ngoals which results in working hard at the wrong things or a lack of focus\n(77%). </span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">4. Has no proven track\nrecord under supervision or authority (73%).</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">5. Emphasizes being a\nnurturer / enabler / facilitator rather than an assertive leader who is\nequipped (68%). </span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">6. Fails to adequately\nresearch and understand the community in which they try to build a church\n(64%). </span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">7. Has no local or extra\nlocal support or encouragement from other leaders (64%). </span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">8. Is unsure about the Holy\nSpirit's leading for the church (59%). </span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">9. Is not willing to take\nresponsibility for church growth (55%). </span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">10. Has ego strength\nproblems. The success or failure of the church is tied to the planter's self\nimage (55%). </span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">11. Is unsure of their call\n(50%).</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">This list is helpful, but obviously not exhaustive. Nothing is said\nhere about moral lapses, marital problems, personal tragedies, and other\nfactors which often contribute to failed church plants. The results do imply,\nhowever, that confident, assertive, and directive leaders are more likely to\nsucceed than leaders who lack those qualities.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The role of assessment and\n\"Boot Camps\"</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Most church planting organizations require prospective church\nplanters to participate in some kind of assessment experience. The purpose of\nthe assessment is to evaluate a church planter's suitability for church\nplanting.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Assessments usually last a few days and can be quite intense.\nSpouses are typically required to attend so assessors can get a good look at\nthe church planter's marriage. Assessment activities include:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Self-evaluation.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Simulations where the church\nplanter is put in a problem solving situation and asked to come up with a\nsolution.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Group activities.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">In-depth interviews.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Some assessment centers measure how well church planting candidates\nstack up against Charles Ridley's 13 characteristics of successful church\nplanters.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn103\" name=\"_ftnref103\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[103]</span></span></span></span></a>\nRidley is a leading pioneer in church planting assessment. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">If you sense God's calling to plant a church, I recommend getting\nassessed. Here's why:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">1. </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Most church planting experts believe that<i> church planting candidates who go through an assessment process are\nmore likely to succeed.</i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"Assessed church planters substantially outperformed those who had\nnot been assessed. Assessed church planters led churches with at least a 20\npercent higher attendance each year during the first 4 years than planters who\nwere not assessed. In year three, churches led by assessed planters were 27\npercent larger than their counterparts.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn104\" name=\"_ftnref104\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[104]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">2. Assessments help\nresource providers </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">(churches/denominations who\nsupply people, equipment, land and money)<i>\nuse their resources wisely. </i>Church planting can be expensive both in\npersonnel and dollars. Churches and denominations should have reasonable\nconfidence that the planter is ready and their call is authentic. Certainly a\nchurch planter seeking to draw people and funding from a local church or\ndenomination should be willing to undergo an assessment if asked.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">3. Church planting is\ncostly to the people involved.</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> Failed attempts to\nplant a church can leave a church planter in a weakened spiritual state. People\nin a poorly led church plant can also be adversely affected. Whether the plant\nsucceeds or fails, the entire endeavor will be very demanding on the church\nplanter's family. An assessment helps sending organizations spot potential\nproblems before planters are out on their own. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">4. A good assessment can\nhelp the church planter prepare for a successful plant.</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> Assessment helps church planters better understand what to expect\nwhen they plant their own church. Talking with a seasoned church planter/assessor\ngrounds the idealism of aspiring church planters in reality. Assessments can\nalso clarify next steps for a planter, and identify character and skill\ndeficiencies that need attention. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">5. A careful assessment\nprovides a time of reflection that can either confirm a legitimate call, or\nexpose a false sense of call</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">. As stated earlier, it\nis possible for someone to be mistaken on this point. An assessment invites an objective\noutside opinion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Boot camps offer church planters intensive training for anywhere\nfrom two days to two weeks. Acts 29, a church planting network founded by <city><place>Seattle</place></city> pastor Mark\nDriscoll, offers one of the better known boot camps.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"Acts 29 Boot Camps are church planting conferences open to the\npublic that focus on the vision of church planting, calling of the planter,\nmandate to multiply churches and the theological foundation for gospel-centered\nchurch planting.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn105\" name=\"_ftnref105\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[105]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Acts 29 Boot Camps combine training with an optional assessment on\nthe third day of the event.

God may not call you to\na place. Instead, he may have a particular group of people in mind for you to\nserve, right in your home town.</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> It isn't\nnecessarily more spiritual to go somewhere. What matters most is following God\nwherever (or to <i>whoever</i>) he leads.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">2. A call </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">(or at least a burden)<i> to\nserve in a particular place often arises from exposure to needs.</i> When Paul\nwas in <city><place>Athens</place></city>,\nthe spiritual state of the Athenians prompted him to speak up. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">(Acts 17:16-17) \"Now while Paul was waiting for them at <place><city>Athens</city></place>, his spirit was\nbeing provoked within him <i>as he was\nobserving</i> the city full of idols. So he was reasoning in the synagogue with\nthe Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles, and in the market place every day with\nthose who happened to be present.\" </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">We have seen members of our own church cultivate similar burdens by\nmaking trips back to the town where they grew up, going on a short-term\nmissions trip, or working in an inner-city school. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"I have come to the conclusion that it is much better to call most\nChristians to look outward first in discovering their callings.

Church planters should prioritize serving in locations (or among\npeople) where the Gospel is not being communicated effectively. As we discussed\nearlier in the course, there are still people and places right here in the <country-region><place>U.S.</place></country-region> that meet\nthis criteria.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">4. Paul also concentrated\nhis preaching efforts on major urban centers. </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">He\nstayed for quite a while in the larger cities of <city>Ephesus</city>\nand <city><place>Corinth</place></city>.\nHis work spilled over from there into surrounding regions. At <city>Ephesus</city>\nLuke says \"all who lived in Asia [not the continent but the Roman province\naround <city><place>Ephesus</place></city>]\nheard the word\" (19:10). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Once major urban centers had been reached, Paul was ready to move on\nto new regions. Read Romans 15:19b-20. Notice that Paul says, \"from <city>Jerusalem</city> and round about as far as <place>Illyricum</place>\n<i>I have fully preached the gospel of\nChrist.</i>\" Paul is not asserting that he covered every aspect of the gospel\nin his preaching. He makes that claim in other places.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn113\" name=\"_ftnref113\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[113]</span></span></span></span></a>\nHere he is saying that his mission to preach the gospel was fully carried out\nfrom <city>Jerusalem</city> to Illyricum (northwest of <country-region><place>Macedonia</place></country-region>). Paul\ndidn't personally plant a church in every village in this giant swath of\nterritory, but he started churches in every major urban center within it.\nApparently he thought this was enough. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"In little more than ten years, <city>St. Paul</city>\nestablished the Church in four provinces of the Empire, <country-region>Galatia</country-region>, <country-region>Macedonia</country-region>,\nAchaia and <place>Asia</place>. Before AD 47 there were no\nChurches in these provinces; in AD 57 St. Paul could speak as if his work there\nwas done, and could plan extensive tours into the far west without anxiety lest\nthe churches which he had founded might perish in his absence for want of his\nguidance and support.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn114\" name=\"_ftnref114\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[114]</span></span></span></span></a>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">IMPLICATION: If you are not sure where God wants you to serve,\nconsider going to a city. God may call some people to plant churches in rural\nareas. And they shouldn't be discouraged from doing so. But established\nchurches looking to spend their resources wisely should be aware of the strategic\nadvantages of cities. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The <place><placename>Redeemer</placename>\n <placetype>Church</placetype> <placename>Planter</placename>\n <placetype>Center</placetype></place> has decided to\nfocus on an urban church planting strategy. In Redeemer's <i>Church Planter Manual</i>, co-written by Tim Keller and J. Allen\nThompson, the authors point out, \"Paul's missionary work was urban-centered...\nChristianity spread better in the urban <place>Roman Empire</place>\nthan in the countryside. Why? 1) People in the city are less conservative, more\nopen to new ideas. 2) Christian evangelists found that, in the city the gospel\ncould spread faster into influence centers-law, politics, arts, etc., and into\ndiverse national groups. By the year 300 A.D., over half of the urban\npopulations of the Empire were Christian while the countryside was pagan. (The\nword paganus means country-man!) The early church was urban.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn115\" name=\"_ftnref115\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[115]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-CA\">WEEK 3</span></b></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Studying your field </span></b></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Once you've settled on your target area/group, it's important to\nlearn as much as you can about the people you're trying to reach.

Here are the two\nof the best: conducting ethnographic and demographic research.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Ethnographic (a.k.a. \"qualitative\") research is usually done with a\nvery small sample of the population you are trying to study. The goal is to\nlearn in-depth information about a few individuals who live in your target\nfield. This information is normally gathered through interviews and\nconversations.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Demographic (a.k.a. \"quantitative\") research seeks to form a\ngeneralized description of a large group of people. It involves surveying a\n\"representative sample\" of the population and making generalizations based on\nthe data obtained. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Both kinds of research are very useful. Let's take a closer look at\neach approach.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">1. Ethnographic\n(qualitative) research</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Goal: To gain in-depth understanding of individuals. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">When Paul arrived in <city><place>Athens</place></city>,\nhe studied what he saw carefully. He \"observed the city full of idols\" (Acts\n17:16). He \"observed that they were religious in all respects\" (17:22). He\ngained this information through walking tours and careful inspection: </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">(Acts 17:23) \"For while I was passing through and examining the\nobjects of your worship, I also found an altar with this inscription, 'TO AN\nUNKNOWN GOD.'\" </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Paul increased his knowledge of the people of <place><city>Athens</city></place> by \"reasoning... in the market place\nevery day with those who happened to be present\" (Acts 17:17). Paul didn't just\ndeclare the gospel. He went back and forth with his listeners, sharing Christ,\nresponding to questions and objections, and then sharing Christ again. Paul\nalso \"conversed\" with Epicurean and Stoic philosophers (Acts 17:18). During\nthese conversations, Paul assessed everything he saw and heard through a\nspiritual grid. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">IMPLICATION: We should walk through the towns or neighborhoods we're\ninterested in reaching, noting how people live. Where do they work? What are\ntheir \"monuments?\" What are their interests and passions? We should also engage\npeople in conversation, share our worldview, gauge their responses, and hear\nwhat they have to say. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">If we observe and listen carefully enough, we'll discover idols,\njust like Paul did. These idols typically won't be figurines of deities as they\nwere in <city><place>Athens</place></city>.\nInstead we'll notice that people are devoting great amounts of time, treasure,\nand emotional energy to certain things that give them a sense of meaning,\npurpose, and identity (e.g. A student of Columbus would be struck by the huge\nRVs and elaborate equipment displayed by tailgaters near Ohio Stadium during a\nhome football game).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"Idols are not just on pagan altars, but in well-educated human\nhearts and minds. The apostle Paul associates the dynamics of human greed,\nlust, craving, and coveting with idolatry (Ephesians 5:5; Colossians 3:5). An\nidol is something within, a creation that is inflated to function as a\nsubstitute for God.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn117\" name=\"_ftnref117\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[117]</span></span></span></span></a>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">We want people in the area to put their faith in Christ. But we'll\nfind that many of them have put their faith in something else. C.K. Chesterton\nsaid, \"when we cease to worship God, we do not worship nothing, we worship\nanything.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn118\" name=\"_ftnref118\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[118]</span></span></span></span></a>\nFinding out what that \"anything\" is should be a primary goal of ethnographic\nresearch. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Through our idols we hope to gain power and control over our lives.\nBut unlike the true God who is ever present and reliable, idols fail to deliver\non their promises. The result of putting one's faith in them is disaster.\nInstead of finding freedom and control, we wind up enslaved. Helping people see\nthis dynamic in their own life is an important stage in bringing them to\nChrist.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">IMPLICATION: A key part of gathering ethnographic information is\nuncovering the idols in which people put their trust. What matters most to\npeople? What are they putting their hope in? Who/what do they look to when they\nare sad, confused, or afraid?<b></b></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The video at the link below is an entertaining example of\nethnographic research. It features Mark Driscoll, pastor of <place><placename>Mars</placename> <placetype>Hill</placetype> <placetype>Church</placetype></place> in Seattle, and Terry Moran from\nABC's <i>Nightline. </i>Driscoll takes Moran\non a driving tour of <city><place>Seattle</place></city>'s\nidols.

One way to do this is by volunteering/working in area stores or social\nservice agencies to get to know people and to build relationships. People may be\nsuspicious of your intentions at first, but if you're transparent about your\nfaith, honest about your interest in planting a church, and diligent to work\nharder and be more useful than everyone around you, over time you will\nestablish trust and build relationships. Through friends formed in settings\nlike this and the many conversations you have with them, you will gain\npriceless insight into the lives of people in your target area. You will also\ncultivate an authentic love for the people that you are trying to reach,\nregardless of how they respond.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Below is a list of topics to explore in interviews and conversations.\nYour goal is to find out what people are like: What are their preferences,\nhobbies, goals, values? What social structures organize their community\n(families, gangs, mosques, churches, schools, sports leagues, clubs/societies)?\nWhat is their world view? You'll need to be flexible and realistic about how\nmuch you can learn in a single conversation. People won't have much to say on\nsome topics, but they'll talk on and on about others. Let them drive the\nconversation, and do your best to remember what you hear.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A.

Is there a certain kind of person in\nthe target area I most identify with/ feel comfortable with? </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Do I need more training (e.g.\nlanguage) to effectively serve the people I am trying to reach? </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">What do mature Christians who\nknow me say about my ability to adapt to the unique features of this\nculture/area?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Demographic and ethnographic research will usually deepen your\nburden for the area/people you are trying to reach. My own conversations with\nresidents in <place>North Linden</place> opened my eyes to\nneeds I never knew existed. I met people with a genuine interest in spiritual\nthings. I also learned about their day-to-day lives and struggles. This led to\nimportant innovations in our ministry (e.g. family meals before each Bible\nstudy) that have helped us be more effective. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Through your research, you may also become aware that you and your\nfamily aren't a good fit for your target field. That's fine. Better to discover\nthis early on than several years into a church plant! </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Defining and explaining\nwhat your church proposes to do</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Jesus gave the church a mission statement:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The Great Commandments: \"Love the Lord your God\" and \"love your\nneighbor as yourself\" (Mt. 22:37-40). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The Great Commission: \"Make disciples of all the nations\" (Mt.\n28:18-20). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Jesus also provided a description of what would happen as this\nmission was carried out: a gradually expanding number of disciples who preach\nthe gospel (Acts 1:8) will enjoy loving, unified fellowship (Jn. 13:34,35;\n17:21) until every ethnic group in the world has heard the gospel (Matt.\n24:15). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">But exactly how will you and your team carry out Jesus' mission, and\nwork toward his vision in the field you have chosen to reach? God has left the\ndetails up to us, and church planters will have to explain those details to the\npeople they lead. These details will be constrained and informed by your <i>core theological beliefs</i>, expressed in <i>values</i> that shape the culture of your\nchurch, and guided by God's <i>vision</i>\nfor your ministry.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">1. Core theological beliefs</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> are those primary issues of theology that define what we believe\nabout God, Jesus, the Holy, Spirit, man, sin, the Bible, the role of the\nChurch, and salvation. These non-negotiables define who we are and what we\nbelieve.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Doctrinal\nstatements should avoid churchy language and state beliefs in plain terms that\nseekers can understand. This is not a place to be creative. If your statement of faith is informed by the\nBible, it will be similar to those of other Bible believing churches. Xenos'\nstatement of faith is good. There are many other good examples. It is important\nfor people to know you are not innovating in this area, and that you have\ncarefully connected each core belief with supporting Bible passages. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">2. Values </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">come from your\ncore beliefs and guide what actions you prioritize and honor. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"A value is a standard for judging\nworth, what is important, and what I am committed to. Values determine, to a\ngreat extent, a person's behavior, what one will do in a given situation.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn121\" name=\"_ftnref121\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[121]</span></span></span></span></a>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">When you walk\ninto any church, it has a \"feel,\" an atmosphere. This \"feel\" varies widely,\neven when churches have identical statements of faith. Why? The difference is\nlargely due to what each church values-what they think is important. People who\nhave been to a church 3 to 5 times can usually identify what some of the\nimportant values are. They might notice, \"This church is really into Bible\nteaching,\" or \"They are committed to helping couples have strong marriages.\"</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">At Xenos, we\nvalue: </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Equipping everyone to serve.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Home church body life.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Evangelism.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Authenticity.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Frontier missions.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Multiplication of disciples and\nhome groups.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Leadership development.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Working with youth.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Common values\nin<i> </i>other churches<i> </i>include<i>:</i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Loving people as they are.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Creativity: presenting God's\nword in fresh and interesting ways.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Excellence: people honoring God\nand loving others with all their might.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Having fun.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Discipleship: establishing\nyoung believers in their faith. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Life change: people taking\ntheir next step toward maturity in Christ no matter where they are.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Corporate prayer: people coming\ntogether to praise God, to thank him, and to ask him for help and guidance. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Community: being a \"church\nfamily.\" </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Seeker-sensitivity. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Mercy and justice: people using\ntheir resources to care for the poor. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Values may\noverlap to some extent with core beliefs, but are usually more specific to the\nsetting in which the church planter is called to minister.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Here are some\nimportant values at Redeemer Presbyterian Church in <city><place>New York City</place></city>.

Here are a few suggestions:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A. Start by reviewing your core beliefs. </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Reflect on what we've said earlier about the church. What must\nchurches do? Which practices are essential? </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">B. Think about your experience in Xenos and other churches. </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">What values did you embrace? Which ones do you want to build into\nyour new church? </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">C. Review the information you gathered from your research. </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Consider the trends, felt needs, and challenges that people face in\nthe area you want to reach. What Biblical teachings (e.g. racial equality;\neternal vs. temporal values; God's concern for the poor) will you need to\nemphasize to be effective?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">D. What are the people on your team burdened and gifted to do? </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">How could their gifts and passions be used to reach people in the\ntarget field? And how might their efforts affect the values of your church? The\ncore of people who later became <placename>Willow</placename>\n<placetype>Creek</placetype> <placename>Community</placename>\n<placetype>Church</placetype> used to gather in the basement\nof <place><placename>South</placename> <placetype>Park</placetype> <placetype>Church</placetype></place>\nto listen to Bill Hybels' band, <i>The\nSonship Express</i>, and to hear a short Bible study. Because performances were\na key part of their gatherings, they attracted other artists as they grew.\nThese performers helped Willow Creek use art forms like music and drama to\nreach non Christians. Over time, creative use of the arts became an important\nvalue at Willow Creek. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Small changes\nin DNA profoundly affect the way an organism functions. Core beliefs and values\naffect the church in a similar way, and should be chosen carefully.\nFortunately, values are easier to establish when a church is just starting out.\nOnce a group has met for awhile, values solidify and become very difficult to\nchange. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">After you've\nsettled on your key doctrines and values, you can devise ways to build them\ninto your church. Of course, you should be able to identify biblical principles\nthat explain or imply the importance of each one. Your values should also\nreflect biblical emphases. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">3.

Research shows that churches planted by teams have a higher survival\nrate. Now let's be more specific about what a church planting team looks like. Keller\nand Thompson make a helpful distinction between a \"core group\" and a \"launch\nteam.\" </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Core group:</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> These are people who are involved in your new church from the very\nbeginning. They plan to attend the new church on regular basis and are\ncommitted to varying levels of service-from \"I plan to show up consistently\" to\n\"I will devote a substantial amount of time to help.\" Folks in the core group\nmay or may not have a clear understanding of their own role in the new church.\nThey may also have stronger ties with each other than with people in the target\nfield.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Launch team: </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A launch team is not your initial congregation. Nor is it a group of\npeople who have promised to help with the launch of your church. It is \"a group\nof 'evangelistic bringers' who have been selected and trained by the church\nplanter to assist in the first stage of the founding of the church.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn131\" name=\"_ftnref131\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[131]</span></span></span></span></a>\nThese individuals are fully behind the vision and leadership of the church\nplanter. They have a clear understanding of what is expected of them, and an\noutward focus. Ideally, a launch team will include brand new converts from the\narea where the church will be planted. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Recruiting a launch team</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Assembling a launch team is a church planter's first test of\nleadership. Building a team requires:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Knowing what kind people you\nwould like to have on your team (i.e. character, personality, ministry\nexperience, cultural background, life situation, age).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Knowing which roles you will\nneed to fill in your new church (i.e. administrative support, teachers, service\ncoordinators, children's ministry workers, youth workers, etc.)</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Looking for people with gifts\nthat complement your weaknesses. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Praying that God would send the\nright people your way. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Remember that ideally your team will include a few folks newly won\nto Christ through your relationships with people in the area.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Here are a few questions to ask when considering a potential member\nof your launch team:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">What type of relationship do\nthey have with you?Can they follow your\nlead? Do they seek and take advice from you?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Have you enjoyed working with\nthem in the past?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Do they have similar ministry\nvalues and a similar view of the church? In a large, established church, people\nmay have a wide variety of opinions on non-essential doctrines. They may also\ndisagree over which ministries are important and which aren't. That's\ninevitable and healthy in most cases. But early on, the church planter should\nseek people who have identical core beliefs and similar values. Frequent\ndisagreements among your team members at the beginning of the church plant can\nleave people demoralized and without a sense of direction. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">How healthy is their marriage? Is\ntheir spouse (if they have one) in agreement with what they want to do?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Do they also have a sense of\ncalling? </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Do friends/pastors/other\nleaders think this would be a good ministry for them to pursue?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">What in this person's past\nmakes you believe they will succeed in your field? </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Are they likely show initiative\nand work hard in a new environment with little feedback or supervision? </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Have they ever brought a new\nperson to the church they currently attend? Have they ever led someone to\nChrist?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Don't be afraid to say \"no\" to people who want to join you. You\naren't obligated to provide a church home or a role on your team for anyone who\nis interested.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Exercise: </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Read the following case study out loud to students, then ask them the\nquestions for discussion below.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"Tom and Judy Allen arrived in <place><city>Seattle</city></place>\nin July 1997 to begin their church plant from scratch. They only had a few\ncontact names and 'literally, no one interested in planting a new church in the\ncity.' On July 2, Tom preached at a PCA church north of center city. After the\nservice a (believing) Korean-American couple and their (unbelieving) Filipino\nhousemate approached Tom and expressed interest. That same afternoon a\n(quasi-feminist, quasi-believing female) Japanese-American law student called\ntheir home to find out 'when your services are...'</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Tom gathered these four individuals the next Sunday in order to\npray. He made it clear that these times of prayer were for 'asking God what he\nthought our church should look like.' After about a month and adding a few more\npeople, Tom decided to begin a Sunday afternoon Bible study for the skeptical,\nthe curious and the committed. The Bible study grew over the course of three\nmonths from the original 4 people to around 25. But this group was not the\nlaunch team! </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Although the Bible study's stated purpose was to expose our\nunbelieving friends to the Gospel, the unstated purpose (known only to Tom) was\nthe assessment of those attending.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">As the group met on Sundays at 4pm, Tom watched closely to see those\nindividuals who actually brought their unbelieving friends-these were the\npeople he began to gather into a different meeting-a Launch Team meeting at 2pm\non Sundays.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">In other words, the only people whom he asked to be on the launch\nteam were 'evangelists' and new converts (they had about eight during this\nphase).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Tom's process in developing the launch team included the following:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">1. He began to take them\nthrough their philosophy of ministry.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">2. He began to talk about\ngoals and launch indicators: </span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A. Twenty people committed\nto the launch team.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">B. Locating the best\npossible facilities for worship. </span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">C. Finding the best\npossible, indigenous, worship/arts director.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">D. Regular experience of\npeople being converted to Christ.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">3. As the group moved\ntoward an actual launch, Tom delegated tasks to such an extent that once they\nbegan, he had very little to do besides showing up.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Within a month of the launch, Tom dissolved the Launch Team and\nevenly divided them into three geographic groups-the beginning of their\nCommunity Group ministry. Because all of the Launch Team members were so\ncarefully chosen, the majority of the people gladly began the Community Group\nphase, seeing it as the 'next thing' they needed to do.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn132\" name=\"_ftnref132\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[132]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Questions for discussion:</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">What are the\nadvantages/drawbacks of using a Bible study to identify potential members of\nyour launch team?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">What is potentially good and\nbad about the way Tom disbanded the launch team and led them into a new\nministry focus? </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Leading your launch team</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Once you have team of people who are willing to join you in the\nproject of planting a new church, what should you do with them? </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">1. Meet together: </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Meet on a regular basis to pray, offer training, and flesh out the\npractical steps that need to be taken to actually start a new church. Launch\nteam members must understand the biblical support for each core belief. They\nmust also be persuaded that the new church's key values are grounded in\nbiblical emphases.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">2. Do ethnographic research:</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> Everyone on your team can do ethnographic research to better\nunderstand the people you're trying to reach. When team members compare notes,\nthey will come up with more accurate observations and conclusions. Swapping\nstories is also a great way cultivate a deeper burden for people who live in\nthe target area.<b></b></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">3. Witness</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">During each interview, walking tour, or conversation with a member\nof the community, launch team members should continually pray that God would\nuse them to bring someone to Christ. Tim Keller reflects on his own church\nplanting experience:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"I came to realize that, by far, the most important person to\nrecruit to this new church was neither the long-time Christian nor the\nnon-Christian. They key person was the brand new Christian, because he or she\nwas without the baggage of expectations from former evangelical churches, and\nstill had lots of strong relationships with non-Christians who could be invited\nto church.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn133\" name=\"_ftnref133\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[133]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Everyone on your launch team should be committed to routinely\nengaging in evangelism.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn134\" name=\"_ftnref134\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[134]</span></span></span></span></a>\nLaunch team members express their commitment by:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Relationship building in the\ntarget area (\"go and be\"). This might involve attending Rotary Club meetings,\nPTA meetings, volunteering at a food bank or school or library, or frequenting\nthe same stores/gas stations to cultivate relationships.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Praying about five people they\ncould lead to Christ, even if they don't yet know the people they are praying\nfor very well.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Being quick to spot new people\nin \"come and see\" gatherings (e.g. cookouts, playgroups, evangelistic small\ngroups), engaging them in conversation, and following up with a phone call or a\nvisit. <b></b></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Your team may also need coaching on starting spiritual\nconversations, sharing their faith, and responding to Christians they meet who\nare interested in your new church.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Some Christians in the target area may be actively involved in\nanother evangelical church. They shouldn't become part of your launch team, but\nthey may know some non-Christians who are warming up to the Gospel. Out of\nfellowship Christians in the area can be a great addition, especially if they\nhave a lot of friends in the area who don't know the Lord. But they can also be\nvery resistant to embracing your vision for the church. It all depends on their\nbackground. <i>Newcomers</i> are<i> </i>churched-Christians who are new to the\narea. They may have theological/strategic views of ministry out of step with\nyours. Or they might fit right in. They usually do not have strong ties to the\ncommunity. Use discernment. <i>Complainers</i>\nare disgruntled older Christians who don't like their current church. It\nprobably won't be long until they find fault with yours. When even a small\nnumber of newcomers and complainers attend a young church, it can be difficult\nto establish healthy DNA. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">4. Brainstorming how you\nwill implement key elements of church life: </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">There\nare several practical questions to answer as you think through the steps\ninvolved in launching your church. Church planters can develop a sense of team\nownership by working through these details with the church planting team.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A. How will your church\ndescribe itself to the community? </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The Xenos website\ndescribes Xenos as \"a culturally relevant, non-traditional and\nnon-denominational church with mainstream biblical doctrines. We develop\ncommunity through home groups led by volunteers.\" What do you want the\ncommunity know about your church?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">B. How will new people\nfirst come in contact with the life of your church </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">(in\nlarge weekend meetings, in home groups/small groups, in classes, etc.)<i>?</i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">C. What style/features will\nyour meetings adopt (music/no music, lecture, discussion, sharings,\ncommunion/no communion, etc)? </span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">D. How should you teach? </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">What misconceptions will you need to dispel?<i> </i>What vocabulary-level should be used (minimally educated, high\nschool educated, college educated)? How long will your teachings be?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">E. What provision will\nthere be for body life: small groups, home churches, men's groups, women's\ngroups?</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> Which are likely to be most effective and\nwhy? Will they be open to non-Christians? Can you meet in the homes of people\nyou want to reach? If not, where will small groups/home groups be held? </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">F. How will you establish\nyoung believers in their faith? How will you equip and mobilize older\nbelievers?</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">G. What criteria will\npotential meeting space need to satisfy </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">(main room\nseating, available parking, kitchen access, visible location, rooms for your\nchildren's ministry, etc.)?<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn135\" name=\"_ftnref135\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[135]</span></span></span></span></a>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">H. What will be your main\nstrategies for building relationships and gathering people to your church</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> (e.g. play groups<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn136\" name=\"_ftnref136\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[136]</span></span></span></span></a>,\nsports leagues, cookouts, community volunteering)? </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">I. What will you do to\nequip people to reach out? E</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">xcluding sermons and\nrelationships, where else will you proclaim the gospel? On the streets? From\ndoor to door? In classes that address felt needs (e.g. marriages, parenting,\netc.)? Over the radio? </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">J. What provision, if any,\nwill be made for child care? </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">At which meetings?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">K. Who will do what? </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Who will oversee the children's ministry? Who will handle logistics\n(e.g. locating a meeting space, overseeing set up and tear down, handling\ncollections, etc.)? How many hours per week will be required for each\nperson?<b></b></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Of course, your view of what churches should do in each of these\nareas has been heavily influenced by your own church experiences, and by models\nof church that are common in our culture. It will take some effort to resist\nthe strong pull to simply do what has been done before. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">In planting a church, you have a rare opportunity to wipe the slate\nclean and create structures that facilitate the essential functions of the\nchurch in a way that fits your target field. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Some traditions may be worth maintaining, but others will hinder\nyour work. Reflect on your ethnographic and demographic research, and keep\ndirecting your team back to the way the New Testament describes the essential\nfunctions of a church. What will those functions look like in your setting?\nRemember, if your church does not speak directly to the situation of the people\nin the field you are trying to reach, you may wind up attracting people from\nnearby communities that are more like you than the people in your target area.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">5. Choose a few things you\nwill do well. </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Trevor Bron, in his paper \"Five\nTruths Churches Struggle to Accept\" maintains that \"churches can do only five\nthings well... For most churches these are the 'Big 5': Worship, Teaching,\nSmall Groups, Kid's Ministry, and Student Ministry.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn137\" name=\"_ftnref137\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[137]</span></span></span></span></a><i></i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">You may\ndisagree with the \"five things\" Bron has chosen. But there are a limited number\nof things a new church can do well. While your church is small and\nunderstaffed, you will have to decide which ministries you can and cannot focus\non. This process of narrowing the scope of your church's activity should be\nguided by your core beliefs, key values, and vision statement.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Can you name a\nfew things your church must do <i>in your\nsetting</i> in order to be effective (e.g. clear Bible teaching, community geared\ntowards families, serving the poor, etc.)? </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Keller and\nThompson point out, \"Each congregation needs to discern its own specific\ncalling, based on the gifts of its leaders, members and the opportunities in\nits community.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn138\" name=\"_ftnref138\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[138]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The ministries you do choose focus on should be suited to the team\nthat you have. Good football coaches design their offensive and defensive\nschemes around the abilities of their players. Choose ministries that maximize\nthe gifting and strengths of your launch team. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">6. Set measurable goals. </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">God is goal-oriented (Eph. 1:10; Luke 13:32, John 17:4, Heb. 12:2).\nSo was Paul (1 Cor. 9:26,27, Phil 2:13,14; 2 Tim. 4:7,8). The Bible encourages\nall Christians to \"run to win\" (1 Cor. 9:24), to compete for an \"imperishable\nwreath\" (1 Cor. 9:25), to \"press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward\ncall of God in Christ Jesus\" (Phil. 3:13,14), \"to run with endurance the race\nset before us\" (Heb 12:1). <i></i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Church planters should not be afraid to state measurable goals and\nstrive for them. People more geared toward shepherding may resist this. But\ngoal setting is a biblical activity, and it's important.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Good goals should be:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A. Specific enough to be\nevaluated.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">e.g.\n\"70% of our folks consistently attending a small group.\" vs. \"People involved\nin fellowship.\"</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">e.g.\n\"Our leadership team will pray together for an hour each week.\" vs. \"Committed\nto prayer.\"</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">e.g.\n\"We will engage in three service projects, invite friends in the community to\nparticipate, and share how our relationship with Christ motivates us to serve.\nWe will hold four seeker small groups where the gospel is presented.\" vs. \"Engaged\nin evangelism.\"</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">B.

Several\napproaches are listed below.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">1. Congregational models: A\nsizable group of people is sent out by the local church.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A. Hiving Off:</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> This is a plant from an existing church that usually involves a\nlarge number of people-at least a couple dozen and maybe many more. First the\nleadership of the existing church identifies a church planter who feels called\nto plant a church somewhere nearby. Then they give the church planter\npermission to recruit people from within the church who live in the target\narea/culture. The church planter gathers people who are willing to join in the\nnew venture, and together they start a church. The resulting church has\nindependent leadership and its own finances. Most people involved in the plant\ndo not need to relocate in order to participate.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">B. Colonization: </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Similar to \"hiving off,\" but the church is planted in a new\ngeographic area. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">C. Satellite/multi-site:</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> One church has multiple sites where large meetings are held. This\napproach is similar to \"hiving off,\" but the new congregation(s) remain under\nthe leadership of the parent church. These large meetings may have a live\nteacher or use video (e.g. At Xenos: North, OSU Campus, West and <place>East Side</place> central teachings).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">D. Multi-congregational\nchurches:</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> Folks in a church start a new meeting in\nthe church's existing facilities for a new ethnic group or age group they are\nreaching.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">E. Accidental parenthood:</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> When disagreement in the church leads to a division, unhappy\nmembers may leave to form a new church. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">2. Mission models: An\nindividual, couple, or small team of people is sent out by the local church.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A. Apostolic:</span></i><b></b><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The planter establishes a church and moves on after a while to start\nanother church (e.g. Paul, Methodist circuit riders).</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">B. Founding Pastor:</span></i><b></b><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The planter starts a church and stays on to be pastor once the\n  church is up and running (e.g. Xenos, Saddleback).</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><place><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Mission</span></place><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> models\ncan be carried out solo (just the church planter and spouse) or in teams. But\nremember, solo church planters have a lower success rate. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The New Testament doesn't <i>prescribe</i>\n(command) a particular church planting technique. What it <i>describes</i> is apostolic planting in teams. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-CA\">WEEK 4</span></b></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Growth strategies</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">How do churches attract new people? How do they grow? The phrases\n\"crowd gathering\" and \"core building\" describe two very different approaches to\ndrawing people into the life of the church. After describing both approaches,\nwe will consider the strengths and weaknesses of each, and ask whether the\nBible prefers one over the other. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">1. Crowd-gathering\n(outside-in): </span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Rick Warren, the well-known pastor of <place><placename>Saddleback</placename> <placetype>Church</placetype></place>,\noffers a summary of this approach: \"A crowd is not a church-but a crowd can be\nturned into a church.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn149\" name=\"_ftnref149\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[149]</span></span></span></span></a>\nPriority is placed on gathering a large group of people to attend a weekend\nservice. The hope is that having a strong turnout for the first meeting will\ngive a new church enough momentum to keep growing. There are two essential\nsteps to taking this approach:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A. Careful planning and\npreparation for a public \"launch meeting.\"</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> A launch\nmeeting is the first official large meeting of the new church, attended by the\nchurch planter, his launch team, and the people they have invited. Going public\nis usually preceded by months of work establishing a healthy core of workers\nwho assist in making the first meeting successful. Often churches have a few\nsmall groups up and running before they host their launch meeting.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Rick Warren started <place><placename>Saddleback</placename>\n <placetype>Church</placetype></place> using a\ncrowd-gathering approach. He went door to-door for twelve weeks introducing\nhimself to hundreds of people. He surveyed them about their needs. Then he\nwrote a letter of invitation that went out to 15,000 people. In addition to\nthis, <city><place>Warren</place></city>\nadds, \"we <i>also</i> used a lot of\nadvertising that first year because we didn't have enough relationships to rely\non word of mouth to build a crowd.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn150\" name=\"_ftnref150\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[150]</span></span></span></span></a>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Some church planters mail 50,000 postcards to households in the\ntarget area, inviting families to attend \"the grand opening of our church.\"\nThey often repeat the mailing a few times, knowing that a certain percentage of\nrecipients will respond. For example, a quarter-percent response rate to 50,000\npostcards will bring 125 people, and some of those people will bring friends\nand family members. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Once the crowd shows up at the first meeting, the church planter\nhopes that the music, teaching, child care, and overall experience are good\nenough to bring people back. Various strategies can be used to entice people to\nreturn for a second meeting. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">When investigators start coming consistently, the goal then becomes\nmoving them toward deeper levels of involvement. <place><city>Warren</city></place> says, \"for about that first year,\nabout all we tried to do was build a crowd and introduce them to Christ.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn151\" name=\"_ftnref151\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[151]</span></span></span></span></a>\nHis next task was to turn the crowd into a church.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">B.

He recommends: </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"Begin\nby moving the unchurched from the community to your crowd (for worship). Then\nmove them from the crowd into the congregation (for fellowship). Next, move\nthem from your congregation into the committed (for discipleship) and from the\ncommitted into the core (for ministry).\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn152\" name=\"_ftnref152\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[152]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><place><city><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Warren</span></city></place><span lang=\"EN-CA\">'s book, <i>The Purpose Driven\nChurch</i>, explains what needs to happen to facilitate each of these steps. </span></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Strengths: </span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Some folks will not come to a\nchurch unless they perceive it to be \"legitimate.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn153\" name=\"_ftnref153\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[153]</span></span></span></span></a>\nA large group of people meeting in a public space boosts credibility in the\nminds of many outsiders. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">If you have an outstanding\nteacher, this approach gives that teacher the opportunity to quickly impact a\nlarge number of people.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Weaknesses:</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">If a very large number people\ncome to the launch meeting, the church planting team may not be able to\nestablish all of the first-time guests in some kind of fellowship. If this\nsituation persists, you may fail to establish healthy body life as part of the\nDNA of your new church. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Keller and Thompson point out,\n\"If you go public too soon, and it is done poorly, it is very hard to re-start\nlater. First impressions are difficult to overcome.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn154\" name=\"_ftnref154\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[154]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">People on the launch team who\npin their hopes on the launch meeting may become passive and neglect personal\nevangelism.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The church planter has no\ninitial role in shaping the core beliefs and key values of the people coming to\nthe large meeting. The new congregation will inevitably have a consumer\nmentality, <i>and</i> have beliefs that\nvalues that are different from those of the church planter. It will be\ndifficult to get this new group to embrace the planter's vision. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">2. Core-building\n(inside-out):</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">In this approach, the launch team becomes the nucleus of a home\nBible study. The church planter and launch team work to foster healthy body\nlife consistent with their values and core beliefs. Each member actively\ninvites people they are meeting in the target field to the Bible study. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Evangelism is primarily done through relationships. Launch team\nmembers host or attend playgroups, dinner/discussion parties, and other social\nevents to build relationships.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Over time, as the group grows, a second or even third group is\nstarted.Once all of the groups have a\ncombined attendance over 75 people or so, the launch team finds a larger,\npublic space to host a \"central teaching\" attended by all the home groups. In\nour culture, Sunday morning is a good large-meeting timeslot for families.\nMeeting times for youth are much more flexible. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Strengths</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">If you've coached your launch\nteam on who to invite (see above), you are more likely to get a higher\npercentage of non-Christians. You will also have far fewer transfers than you\nwould with a crowd-gathering approach.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn155\" name=\"_ftnref155\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[155]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">An inside-out approach conveys\na higher value for Christian fellowship to everyone involved from the very\nbeginning of the church. This kind of fellowship is described and <i>prescribed</i> in the New Testament.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Starting with a small, cohesive\ngroup makes it much easier to start your church with good DNA.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Weaknesses</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Some people will not come out\nto a meeting in someone's home that isn't connected with an established church.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn156\" name=\"_ftnref156\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[156]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A network of house churches or\nsmall groups that does not offer a public meeting within year can lose\nmomentum. Keller and Thompson warn, \"Bible studies or cell groups alone won't\nhold people.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn157\" name=\"_ftnref157\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[157]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>&#xB7;</span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">It can take awhile to develop\n\"critical mass.\" This may demoralize some members of your launch team. Church\nplanters using this approach must manage expectations.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Which approach is better?</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">In the early church we see a mixture of large<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn158\" name=\"_ftnref158\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[158]</span></span></span></span></a>\nand small<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn159\" name=\"_ftnref159\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[159]</span></span></span></span></a>\ngatherings. Large meetings featured evangelism (Acts 2:41; 4:4), preaching and\nteaching (Acts 5:42). In smaller groups, they shared meals (Acts 16:34), took\ncommunion (Acts 2:46), listened to teachings (Acts 5:42), prayed together (Acts\n12:12), and encouraged each other (Acts 16:40). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">We also see signs of \"crowd-gathering\" and \"core-building.\" The\napostles were already meeting with a committed core of people in the upper room\nwho listened to teachings and prayed together. But they also attracted 3000\npeople into their church in a single day! </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">I wouldn't rule out core-building or crowd-gathering. But I am wary\nof using mass-marketing with a consumer-oriented appeal. Peter drew crowds by\npreaching God's word in a dynamic way, not by the promise of a strong\nchildren's ministry and the opportunity to make new friends. If we only\nemphasize what our new church has to offer, the crowd of consumers we attract\nwill prove to be very difficult to work with. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Whichever approach you take, once you begin to meet, it is important\nto meet consistently. People shouldn't be wondering week to week when or where\nyour meetings will be held. If you have a good turnout, great. If hardly anyone\nshows up, that's fine. Everyone should know that the meeting will go on with or\nwithout them. When there is a low turnout, don't bag your teaching. Proceed as\nnormal. If the church planter is going on vacation, someone else should cover\nthe teaching. If people in your church think you should cancel the meeting\nbecause of a competing community event, have the meeting anyhow. Dependable\nchurch planter teachings and steady attendance by the launch team will provide\nmuch needed stability in the early days of your church.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-CA\">How to establish key\nvalues at the beginning of your church </span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Once a church is up and running, the church planter and launch team\nmust reinforce the key values they settled on during their planning. What\nstructures, practices, and teaching emphases will you employ to solidify key\nvalues in your new church? Below are listed a few key values at Xenos that have\nserved us well, along with practical steps we have taken to instil these values.\nSeeing specific steps taken at Xenos may give you ideas for your own church. As\nyou cover this material, ask students to reflect on what is good or what may be\nlacking in Xenos' approach to each area.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">1. Corporate prayer </span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">When a church planter and launch team have prayed together\nconsistently during the launch phase of the church, they're in a good position pass\nthis habit on to their congregation.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">We urge Xenos home group leaders to pray with people in their groups\non a regular basis. We also talk about the role prayer plays in healthy\nfriendships, and encourage people to pray together whenever they meet. Young\nChristians are often afraid to pray out loud with other Christians. We work\nhard to help them overcome this barrier so they can experience the unity and warm\nfellowship that Christians enjoy during corporate prayer. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Corporate prayer sessions can be dry and tiring when someone prays\non and on. Periodic reminders to keep prayers concise and to 'Amen' each other maintain\nthe quality of group prayer sessions.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">2. Evangelism</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">During your first few meetings, excitement about your church will be\nhigh, and folks will want to bring a friend with them. But that won't last\nforever. Helping your church maintain an outward focus takes regular teaching\non the importance evangelism and consistent use of \"go and be\" and \"come and\nsee\" approaches in order to build relationships with nonChristians and share\nthe gospel. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Go and be: </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">We advocate participation in \"Go Groups\" where Christians can pair\nup and volunteer in the community together. Being a helpful neighbor builds\nfriendships with non-Christians, puts Christ in a good light, and opens doors\nto share the gospel.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Come and see: </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">We work hard to make non-Christian guests feel comfortable and\nwelcome at our weekend teachings. Tim Keller reflects on how this value worked\nout in the early days of Redeemer Presbyterian Church: </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"Preaching and evangelism was to assume the presence of\nnon-Christians even before we knew if any were there. If we preached as if they\nwere there, they most definitely would be invited... We realized that the most\ncrucial event in the life of our church was the moment a Christian came to\nworship and said, 'I want my skeptical friends to see this!'\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn160\" name=\"_ftnref160\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[160]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"Come and see\" events like Conversations and Cuisines<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn161\" name=\"_ftnref161\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[161]</span></span></span></span></a>\nand social parties are also a great way to expose non-Christians to the life of\nthe church.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Evangelism is an important emphasis in our equipping classes. And when\nindividuals see fruit in evangelism, we make a point to rejoice with them. What\nwe celebrate reveals what we value. <i></i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">3. Loving personal\ninvestment </span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Jesus repeatedly taught that self-giving love was the key to an\nabundant life.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn162\" name=\"_ftnref162\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[162]</span></span></span></span></a>\nIn our study of Acts 20 and 1 Thessalonians 2, we saw how Paul \"imparted his\nown life\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn163\" name=\"_ftnref163\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[163]</span></span></span></span></a>\nto people in the churches he planted, as he \"exhorted, encouraged, and implored\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn164\" name=\"_ftnref164\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[164]</span></span></span></span></a>\neach person. This level of involvement is not just for leaders like Paul, but\nshould be the norm for all Christians.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn165\" name=\"_ftnref165\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[165]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">When believers form friendships centered on a shared commitment to\nfollow Christ, there are many opportunities to invest in each other. Our main\nstructure for facilitating this kind of close interaction is home church. There\nare additional opportunities for loving investment in the communities we are\ntrying to reach. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">God has also gifted each Christian in a unique way to serve others.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn166\" name=\"_ftnref166\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[166]</span></span></span></span></a>\nAnd so we repeatedly make the case from scripture that every believer should have\na concrete ministry. Every member ministry is not just a lofty ideal, but a\nbasic requirement for the local church to function the way it should.</span></p>\n\n<i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><br clear=\"all\">\n</span></i>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">4. Youth</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Xenos has always emphasized working with youth. This emphasis can be\nmeasured in how we deploy our staff and spend our resources. Both of our senior\npastors work with college students and pre-family adults. Many of our adults\nare mobilized to serve in youth ministries of various kinds. Starting out as a\nyouth movement helped Xenos grow more quickly than it would have if we had\nattempted to start a church filled with families.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">5. Serving together, not\nalone</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Xenos was started in early 70's by two men who have served together\never since. They lead our board of elders, debate important decisions, and work\ntogether as a team. We value the wisdom and balance that their joint leadership\nprovides. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The value of working together extends to every ministry in our\nchurch. We prefer to see home groups and ministry teams led by teams of\nleaders. And whenever someone takes on a big task, we try to surround them with\nthe support they need to succeed. Certainly church planting would be one of\nthose tasks!</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"Those who try to plant a church without the support and counsel of\nothers have greater risk and less chance of survivability. The church planter\nwho meets with a group of church planting peers at least monthly increases the\nodds of survivability by 135 percent. We found that out of those church\nplanters who were part of a peer group, 83 percent of their churches survived\nwhereas only 67 percent of church plants among those who did not have a peer group\nsurvived. The old adage, 'You can't do it alone' is true. Church planters need\nto learn from each other and support one another through the blessings and the\ntrials.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn167\" name=\"_ftnref167\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[167]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Serving together provides accountability and a countermeasure to\nSatan's constant attempts to introduce error and distortion into the church. In\nphysical warfare, Solomon says, \"there is victory in an abundance of\ncounselors.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn168\" name=\"_ftnref168\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[168]</span></span></span></span></a>The same is true in a spiritual war.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">6. Financial Stewardship </span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">New churches will benefit from having a \"stewardship plan\"-a process\nfor mobilizing Christians to use their resources to advance God's purposes. At\nXenos, our plan includes the following: </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A. We teach the biblical\nconcept of stewardship in our core classes.</span></i><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn169\" name=\"_ftnref169\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[169]</span></span></span></span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">B.

We explain our financial\nneeds once a year in our home churches, and in our large weekend meetings. </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">We want people to know how the church's resources are spent and how\nthat spending is connected to our vision. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">D. When individuals make a\npledge, we give them feedback on their giving progress. </span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Having a stewardship plan of some kind is important, and it correlates\nwith higher church plant success rates. \"Of those church plants who had a\nstewardship development plan, 81 percent of churches survived whereas only 68\npercent of church plants survived among those who did not have a stewardship\nplan.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn171\" name=\"_ftnref171\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[171]</span></span></span></span></a> </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">7. Discipleship and\nleadership development</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">We challenge everyone to participate in the work of making\ndisciples, regardless of their maturity level. Anyone can start simply by <i>being with</i> people they are trying to\ninfluence (Acts. 4:13;20:28), <i>taking\nnotice of their needs</i> (Phil. 2:3,4), and <i>praying</i> for them. When Christians embrace their identity as\nservants (Acts 20:19; Phil 2:3,4; 1 Cor. 9:19; 2 Cor. 4:5; 2 Cor. 6:4), they\nlook for further ways to build up others. As they grow in their own knowledge\nof the word, God will give them opportunities to share what they have learned.\nOver time, their life of service will give them further influence because their\nlifestyle is gradually becoming worthy of imitation (Acts 20:35; 2 Cor. 9:13;\nPhil. 1:12-14; 1 Thes. 2:10-12).<i></i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">God doesn't want everyone to be a leader. But we urge our existing\nleaders to always be looking to develop new leaders who are able to teach\nothers.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn172\" name=\"_ftnref172\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[172]</span></span></span></span></a>\nIf a church planter begins developing new leaders on day one, leadership\ndevelopment will more likely become part of the culture of the new church.\nResearch shows that leadership training correlates with higher church plant\nsurvivability.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"If the church planter provides leadership development training for\nnew church members, the odds of survivability increase by over 250 percent. Of\nthose church planters who provided leadership training to church members, 79\npercent of their churches survived compared to only 59 percent of church plants\nsurvived among those who did not provide leadership training. Clearly, it's\nworth the extra effort to develop leaders from the beginning of the church\nplant.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn173\" name=\"_ftnref173\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[173]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">8. A high view of scripture</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Teaching and instruction are needed to make a case for each of the\nareas above. For this instruction, we turn to the Bible, the final authority on\nall questions of doctrine.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">We also teach people how to study and accurately interpret the word\nfor themselves. When church members are confident they can understand the\nBible, they are more likely to read and obey it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">People must also be persuaded that the Bible is truly from God and\ntrustworthy. Whether Christians or not, most newcomers have doubts about the\nreliability and truthfulness of the Bible. We spend five hours in one of our\ncore training classes providing students with sound reasons for believing that\nthe Bible is God's word (inspiration) and that we have the correct set of\ninspired books (canonicity). </span><b></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Next steps </span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">You may be convinced that God has called you to plant a church, but\nunsure what step to take next. Here are a few issues to consider: </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">1.<b> </b>Growing in public</span></i><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn174\" name=\"_ftnref174\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[174]</span></span></span></span></span></a><i></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">As we saw earlier, strengthening and encouraging disciples is a key\ntask for church planters. Paul wanted his church planting partners Timothy and\nTitus to help the people they serve to grow spiritually.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn175\" name=\"_ftnref175\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[175]</span></span></span></span></a>\nBut he also urged them to pay close attention to <i>their own spiritual progress</i>. <i></i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">(1 Timothy 4:12-14) \"Don't let anyone think less of you because you\nare young. Be an example to all believers in what you teach, in the way you\nlive, in your love, your faith, and your purity. Until I get there, focus on\nreading the Scriptures to the church, encouraging the believers, and teaching\nthem. Do not neglect the spiritual gift you received through the prophecies\nspoken to you when the elders of the church laid their hands on you.\"</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">(Titus 2:7,8) \"And you yourself must be an example to them by doing\ngood deeds of every kind. Let everything you do reflect the integrity and\nseriousness of your teaching. Let your teaching be so correct that it can't be\ncriticized. Then those who want to argue will be ashamed because they won't\nhave anything bad to say about us.\"</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Paul was eager to see Timothy and Titus advance in three areas: growing\nin godly character (1 Tim. 4:12; Titus 2:7a), teaching God's word (1 Tim. 4:13;\nTitus 2:7b), and using their spiritual gifts (1 Tim. 4:14). Paul's challenge to\nTimothy: \"give your complete attention to these matters so that everyone will\nsee your progress.\" (1 Tim. 4:15)</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Paul wanted these men to grow in public. He wanted the Christians\nthey led to see them progressing and growing spiritually. Paul believed this\nwas essential part of influencing other people to grow. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"What your people need most from you is your personal holiness.\" -\nRobert Murray M'Cheyne<b></b></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">You cannot lead others into growth unless you are growing. Water can\nrise no higher than its own level. If you aren't growing in your own spiritual\nlife, your ministry will lack the spiritual power needed to move people toward\nGod. But if you <i>are</i> making progress, God\ncan use your example to inspire others to follow him. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\"Successful church planters are spiritual... many church planters\nare by nature entrepreneurs, mavericks, free spirits, sometimes even misfits...\nThat energy can be harnessed and focused to be used for God's glory but only if\nthe church planter is Christ-centered and transformed by the power of the\ngospel. In other words, a newcomer needs to leave the church being amazed by\nthe awesome God the church planter serves, not what a cool preacher the church\nhas.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn176\" name=\"_ftnref176\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[176]</span></span></span></span></a><b></b></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">It will require sustained effort to become more like Christ, handle\nthe word accurately, and use your spiritual gifts. This is evident from the\nverbs Paul uses: \"discipline yourself,\" \"labor and strive,\" \"take pains with,\"\n\"be absorbed in,\" \"pay close attention to,\" \"persevere in.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn177\" name=\"_ftnref177\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[177]</span></span></span></span></a>\nFortunately, God supplies his life and power to bring this transformation\nabout. When we are strengthened by his grace (2 Tim. 2:1), growth in each of\nthese areas is possible. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">2. Talk to other people\nabout your burden:</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">If you think God is calling you to plant a church, tell your\nfriends. Let them in on your plans and aspirations. Listen to what they have to\nsay. Ask them to pray for you, and pray with them as you consider what to do\nnext. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">3. Training </span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">We recommend taking as many adult education classes as you can. You\nwill learn on the job, but classroom training can give you a good foundation\nthat will help you as a teacher and leader.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">4. Home group ministry</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">We always hear from missions agencies we partner with that extensive\nexperience in home group work has been excellent preparation for our people who\nserve on the field. Xenos home groups are a great incubator for ministry\nskills. There are plenty of opportunities to teach and to learn how to serve.\nMake the most of them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">5. Money</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Church planting experts disagree on the amount of financial support\na church planter needs. A recent study commissioned by the Leadership Network\nfound that, \"on average, church planters receive financial support from their\ndenomination for 32 months... Only 7% of planters are fully funded without any\npersonal fundraising required (funding could come through national, regional,\nand local efforts). While 27% of survey respondents reported that their\nplanters raise all of their own funding, the majority (55%) report that their\nplanters receive denomination funds <i>and</i>\nraise their own support.\" <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn178\" name=\"_ftnref178\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[178]</span></span></span></span></a>\nAt the Vineyard Church of Columbus<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn179\" name=\"_ftnref179\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[179]</span></span></span></span></a>,\nchurch planters receive one time support of anywhere from $12-25,000. This\nmoney is managed by an elder board chosen before the new church starts. Some of\nthe money goes for the planter's salary, some covers promotion and other\nministry expenses. Church planters from other Vineyard churches get a one time\ncheck for $2,500 plus whatever their sending church will provide. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">In the Calvary Chapel movement, financial support is the exception,\nnot the rule. The <place><placename>Redeemer</placename>\n <placetype>Church</placetype> <placename>Planting</placename>\n <placetype>Center</placetype></place> takes a different\napproach. They commit to paying the church planter's salary for the first three\nyears. Church planters from the Acts29 network are expected to raise most of\ntheir financial support.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Exercise:</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> Ask students to discuss the pros and cons of low and high amounts\nof financial support. Tent-making church planters have limited time, and are\nforced to delegate responsibilities to their team. This can create a healthy\nvacuum for launch team members to fill. They also become contributing members\nof the community and build relationships through work contacts. But imagine\nwhat it would be like to hold down a job, lead a brand new church, and raise a\nfamily! Time on the job will inevitably reduce time for pastoring. This may\nslow the growth of the new church. An overtaxed schedule could also disrupt the\nchurch planter's family life. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Values that will help or\nhinder church planting at Xenos</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">If Xenos is going to become a thriving center of church planting, here\nare a few values we will need to embrace:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">1. Being responsible about\nleaving current ministries.</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> Home group and ministry\nteam leaders should do their best to raise up new leaders to take their place. As\nwe transition to new ministries, we should do everything we can to ensure that\nthe people we have been serving will be cared for. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">2. A willingness to allow\nnew churches to be significantly different from ours.</span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> We don't want to plant new churches that reject our core\ntheological beliefs. But in order to reach new people in new settings, our church\nplanters must adopt a unique vision suitable for their field.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn180\" name=\"_ftnref180\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[180]</span></span></span></span></a>\nThey will see the need to develop new structures and strategies which may make\nus uncomfortable. New churches will not and should not look exactly like our\nown. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">3. A concern for the growth\nof God's kingdom outside our church. </span></i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Paul was able\nto celebrate the advance of the gospel, even when the people advancing it had\nquestionable motives.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn181\" name=\"_ftnref181\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[181]</span></span></span></span></a>\nKeller and Thompson see this value \"in the way Paul... constantly takes his\nhands off new churches... What we have here is a concern not for his own power\nor his party's power (and even then, different apostles had their followers and\nemphases), but the kingdom as a whole. Test: When we lose two families to a\nchurch that brings in 100 other people who weren't going to any other church,\nwe have a choice! Will we resent the 10 people we have lost or rejoice in the\n80 people they kingdom has gained?\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn182\" name=\"_ftnref182\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[182]</span></span></span></span></a><b></b></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-CA\">4.

Who could fill their shoes? Fortunately, God is committed to raising\nup workers to take their place.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn183\" name=\"_ftnref183\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[183]</span></span></span></span></a>\nAfter sending missionaries overseas, time and again we have seen God use their\nabsence to mobilize other Christians to step up and serve. When God has clearly\ncalled someone to plant a church, we need to entrust our own ministry to him\nand let the person go. Research shows that churches who plant churches usually do\nnot suffer long term losses. On the contrary, \"It would appear that churches\nwhich sponsor church plants are positively affected in Sunday morning worship\nattendance, baptisms, and Sunday School attendance.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn184\" name=\"_ftnref184\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[184]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-CA\">A final thought</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The church is the beautiful bride of Christ, his prized possession,\nthe one for whom he died on the cross. Through the church Jesus is carrying out\nhis plan of redemption and extending his kingdom. What a privilege it would be to\npartner with God to establish a new church! </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Bill Hybels, the founding pastor of <place><placename>Willow</placename> <placetype>Creek</placetype>\n <placename>Community</placename> <placetype>Church</placetype></place>,\nis fond of saying, \"the local church is the hope of the world... the church is\nthe only God-anointed agency in society that stewards the transforming message\nof the love of Christ.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/churchplanting/index.htm#_ftn185\" name=\"_ftnref185\" title=\"\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\">[185]</span></span></span></span></a>\nHe's right.

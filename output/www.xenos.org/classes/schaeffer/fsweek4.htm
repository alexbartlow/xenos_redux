Or rather, we can talk--and shout, demand, and vilify--but\n        we cannot reason. We lack agreed-upon standards to which we can refer\n        our disputes. In the absence of shared notions of justice or equity,\n        many of the issues we confront appear increasingly to be unresolvable.\n        . . Increasingly, debates take place between antagonists who deny their\n    opponents&#x92; ability to understood their plight. Inevitably, that turns\n    such clashes into increasingly bitter <i>ad hominem</i> attacks in which\n    victim status and the insistent demands for sensitivity are played as trump\n    cards. . . Of course, sensitivity to the needs and concerns of others is\n    the mark of a civil and civilized society. But the victimist demand for sensitivity\n    is more problematic. To be sensitive is not to argue or reason but to feel,\n    to attune one&#x92;s response to another&#x92;s sense of aggrievement.\n    . . One can be insensitive without intending to be; only the victims can\n    judge.\"</p>\n    <p>--Charles Sykes, <i>A Nation of Victims</i></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Necessity of maintaining the power of principle and love for\n      the lost</li>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n<i></i><p>Understanding postmodern culture\n\n</p><ul>\n  <li>The manipulability of belief</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"We assume beliefs are under conscious control at all\n  times.

In regard to propaganda the early\n  advocates of universal literacy and a free press envisaged only two possibilities: the\n  propaganda might be true, or it might be false. They did not foresee what in fact has\n  happened, above all in our Western capitalistic democracies--the development of a vast\n  mass communications industry, concerned in the main neither with the true nor the false,\n  but with the unreal, the more or less totally irrelevant. In a word, they failed to take\n  into account man&#x92;s almost infinite appetite for distractions. . .

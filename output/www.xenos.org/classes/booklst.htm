Ortiz fills the\n      book with colorful and humorous illustrations while writing with serious conviction. Good\n      for younger or older Christians.</p>\n      <p><i>Celebration of Discipline</i><b>&amp;&amp;</b> by Richard Foster (Harper and Row)</p>\n      <p>Foster shows that God has prescribed a number of disciplines that are the key to our\n      growth. He compare spiritual disciplines to disciplines in any field, showing that\n      discipline is God's way. A very good book to challenge our passivity. Also helpful in our\n      prayer life.</p>\n      <p><i>Changed into His Likeness</i><b>&amp;&amp;</b> by Watchman Nee (Christian Literature Crusade / Tyndale).</p>\n      <p>Nee studies three OT characters to show how God changes people. Great insight and\n      convicting reading. Good for a Christian of any age.</p>\n      <p><i>Decision Making and the Will of God</i><b>&amp;&amp;</b> by Gary Freison (Multnomah).</p>\n      <p>Even though this is an issue-oriented book, it is important for spiritual growth\n      because discerning God's will is a big part of learning to follow him. Frieson argues with\n      what he calls the \"traditional view\" of following various \"road signs\"\n      to discover God's will. Fascinating and challenging reading, full of scripture study.</p>\n      <p><i>Desiring God</i>,<b>&amp;&amp;</b> John Piper</p>\n      <p>Most Christians struggle with Paul's command to \"Rejoice in the Lord <i>always.</i>\"\n      Commonly we forget that God is the single happiest and contented person in the universe.\n      We tend to think that He is disappointed with us or that His demands are burdensome. Piper\n      explores the Scriptures to come up with some surprising conclusions. Provocative reading\n      because of the way he approaches things.</p>\n      <p><i>Disappointment with God</i><b>&amp;&amp;</b> by Philip Yancey (Zondervan)</p>\n      <p>Yancey shows how our expectations of God are disappointed, and then we have a typical\n      \"Job reaction.\" His discussion of how to come to terms with God's love is very\n      convicting, especially if you have been through some trials and disappointments.</p>\n      <p><i>Finding God</i><b>&amp;&amp;</b> by Larry Crabb (Zondervan).</p>\n      <p>A look at some of the deeper attitudes and problems we face as we grow as Christians\n      and try to get closer to God. Barriers come up from our own expectations and our\n      sinfulness. This is a book for Christians who have been through some suffering or\n      frustration in their sanctification.</p>\n      <p><i>Five Views on Sanctification</i><b>&amp;&amp;&amp;</b> by Deiter, Hoekema, Horton, McQuilken and Walvoord (Zondervan; Academie\n      Books).</p>\n      <p>A more scholarly discussion of sanctification from 5 different theological traditions;\n      the Wesleyan, Reformed, Pentecostal, Keswick and Augustinian-Dispensational view.\n      Excellent reading for someone who is at the stage of studying more seriously.</p>\n      <p><i>Honest to God? Becoming an Authentic Christian</i><b>&amp;</b> by Bill Hybels (Zondervan)</p>\n      <p>Hybels challenges us to be consistent with our Christianity, in the family, in the work\n      place, in our attitudes and prayers. He offers typical signs of inconsistency and\n      practical advice on how to sincerely follow God. Good conviction for Christians of any\n      age.</p>\n      <p><i>In Pursuit of Maturity</i><b>&amp;&amp;</b> by J. Oswald Sanders (Zondervan)</p>\n      <p>Another good all around treatment of spiritual growth, including a huge number of\n      relevant topics such as suffering, developing good habits, prayer, etc.</p>\n      <p><i>Knowing God</i><b>&amp;&amp;</b> by J.I. Packer (IVP)</p>\n      <p>A classic work on the challenge of getting to know God. Packer makes a case that this\n      is the ultimate point of our existence, as well as the most rewarding pursuit of life. The\n      majority of the book shows us pictures of God from the sciptures.</p>\n      <p><i>Knowledge of the Holy</i><b>&amp;</b> by A.W. Tozier </p>\n      <p>A classic work on getting to know God, some of the barriers and benefits. Very\n      convicting words about how we pursue the things of God rather than God himself. Good for a\n      study group or a new Christian.</p>\n      <p><i>Love Not the World</i><b>&amp;</b>, Watchman Nee</p>\n      <p>Nee's insight into scripture exposes this world for what it really is; and the answers\n      will surprise you. He also gives good advice on how to \"be in this world but not of\n      it.\" A great book for new Christians, or anyone living in America.</p>\n      <p><i>Loving God</i>,<b>&amp;</b> Chuck Colson</p>\n      <p>With something like a billion copies sold, there must be something good here. Colson\n      uses entertaining stories in each chapter to show the reader the importance of the Bible,\n      faith, friendship, etc. on the Christian's personal relationship with God. Great reading\n      for young Christians.</p>\n      <p><i>No Little People</i><b>&amp;&amp;</b> by Francis Schaeffer (IVP).</p>\n      <p>Schaeffer studies a number of figures in the Bible with lessons on sanctification.\n      Great insight and teaching material. Schaeffer's writing makes this book a little bit\n      thick, probably intended for a college audience.</p>\n      <p><i>Release of the Spirit</i><b>&amp;&amp;&amp;</b> by Watchman Nee (Sure Foundation).</p>\n      <p>Nee focuses on the need for brokenness in serving God. By brokeness Nee means a lack of\n      confidence in our \"outer man\" (emotions, intellect, will, etc.), and a greater\n      confidence in God. Very convicting reading, probably for Christians 3 or 4 years old in\n      the Lord.</p>\n      <p><i>Screwtape Letters</i>,<b>&amp;&amp;</b> C.S. Lewis</p>\n      <p>A classic of Christian fiction. Lewis uses a correspondence between two demons, one\n      experienced and one novice, to demonstrate to the reader the nature of spiritual warfare.\n      Great insights into the strategies of Satan and the ways of man.</p>\n      <p><i>Sit, Walk and Stand</i><b>&amp;</b> by Watchman Nee (CLC)</p>\n      <p>A concise, understandable study of Ephesians. Great for new Christians or study groups\n      to discuss a foundation for the Christian life.</p>\n      <p><i>Spiritual Authority</i><b>&amp;&amp;</b> by Watchman Nee (Christian Fellowship Publishers, NY).</p>\n      <p>Although this book is also about authority and leadership in the church, much of it\n      centers on our personal problem with rebellion. Authority is at the heart of God's work\n      with us, and Nee demonstrates this with many interesting and convicting stories in the\n      Bible. The second half of the book is an excellent exhortation to those who want to be\n      leaders in the church. We have no authority in ourselves. This book is a must-read for\n      anyone who wants to be a leader or worker because it shows the humility we need to have.</p>\n      <p><i>Teach Us To Pray</i><b>&amp;&amp;</b> edited by D.A.

Stanford gives the reader a picture for what spiritual\n      maturity looks like and the heart attitude that accompanies it. Stanford investigates such\n      topics as time, acceptance, hope, and faith and their relationship to the believer. Good\n      for new Christians.</p>\n      <p><i>The Normal Christian Life</i><b>&amp;</b> by Watchman Nee (Tyndale). </p>\n      <p>A discussion of Romans 5-8 from someone who really understands sanctification. Nee is\n      good because you can tell he is completely given to Christ. So he is very convicting. Good\n      for someone who is at least one year old in the Lord.</p>\n      <p><i>The Pursuit of Holiness</i><b>&amp;&amp;</b> by Jerry Bridges (NavPress)</p>\n      <p>Bridges discusses many issues that pertain to sanctification, such as faith,\n      self-discipline, sins of the flesh, etc. A good all-around treatment of the issue. Good\n      for an introduction to the topic of spiritual growth.</p>\n      <p><i>The Strategies of Satan</i>,<b>&amp;</b> Wiersbe</p>\n      <p>Wiersbe describes Satan's role in the world in four parts: the deceiver, the tempter,\n      the destroyer, and the accuser. This book does a very good job of showing how the devil\n      works in the life of the believer without being sensational. New Christians will really\n      benefit.</p>\n      <p><i>True Spirituality</i><b>&amp;&amp;</b> by Francis Schaeffer (Tyndale).</p>\n      <p>Shaeffer discusses the effects of sin on human nature and what it means to be changed\n      by God. His language is difficult at times, reader should have a good vocabulary. Good for\n      anyone over a year in the Lord.</p>\n      <p><i>Walking in Victory</i><b>&amp;</b> by Dennis McCallum (Navpress)</p>\n      <p>A study of Romans 5-8 with a clear, strong emphasis on living the Christian life on the\n      basis of grace.

Hodges has written this book\n      in response to John MacArthur's <i>The Gospel According to Jesus</i>, which argues that\n      salvation also requires us to submit to the authority of Jesus Christ and commit ourselves\n      to follow him (sometimes referred to as \"Lordship Theology\").</p>\n      <p><i>Basic Christianity</i><b>&amp;</b> by John Stott (IVP)</p>\n      <p>A basic description of salvation covering man's need, the person of Christ, the cross\n      and repentance.

Montgomery (Bethany House).</p>\n      <p>An excellent collection of articles on subjects such as demonology in history,\n      anthropology, the Bible, the connection between demonology and psychology, and pastoral\n      care.</p>\n      <p><i>Foundations of Evangelical Theology</i><b>&amp;&amp;&amp;</b> by John J. Davis\n      (Baker).</p>\n      <p>This book argues for one of the main distinctives of evangelical Christians, the\n      revelation of God in the Scriptures. He builds a case for a conservative view of the\n      scriptures and interpretation. Good for someone who is ready to begin studying theology,\n      the Bible, etc., and needs a foundation (275 pages).</p>\n      <p><i>God's Strategy in Human History</i><b>&amp;&amp;</b> by R.

The book argues against\n      predestination in personal salvation. One of the best scriptural treatments on the issue\n      from the non-Calvinist perspective.</p>\n      <p><i>I Believe In The Historical Jesus</i><b>&amp;&amp;</b> by I.H. Marshall (Eerdmans)</p>\n      <p>Deals with modern critical questions concerning Jesus as he is presented in the\n      gospels.

Good for new Christians.</p>\n      <p><i>Predestination and Free Will</i><b>&amp;&amp;&amp;</b> ed. by D. Basinger and R. Basinger (IVP)</p>\n      <p>Four views on this fascinating topic, with responses to one another's positions. At\n      only 180 pages the coverage is not very deep, but it is very interesting reading. This\n      would be a good book to start with if you wanted to research this topic.</p>\n      <p><i>Redemption Accomplished and Applied</i><b>&amp;&amp;</b> by John Murray (Eerdmans).</p>\n      <p>For a more in-depth look at the cross and what exactly happens when we turn to Christ,\n      this is a well written, informative work. For under 200 pages it covers a lot. Murray\n      believes in predestination, meaning he has a very strong view of the Spirit's role in our\n      repentance. On the whole, great for anyone wanting to understand the cross more.</p>\n      <p><i>Spiritual Warfare</i><b>&amp;&amp;</b> by Ray Stedman (Multnomah).</p>\n      <p>Very practical advice about how the demons try to discourage and attack Christians.\n      Talks about the difference between our own sin and demonic attack.

This book relates much of his research in a popular format. Even\n      if you think you've heard enough about the cross, this book will fascinate you with it's\n      insight into the biblical pictures of the atonement and some of the arguments that swirl\n      around this issue.</p>\n      <p><i>The Christian Life: An Owner's Manual</i><b>&amp;</b> by Scot McCallum (Kregel)</p>\n      <p>What book do you give to new Christians to explain basic Christian doctrines without\n      boring their socks off? Here is one answer. The basic and necessary teachings of the Bible\n      in an interesting, readable format. Full of stories, a focus on narrative, and humor. </p>\n      <p><i>The Great Divorce</i>,<b>&amp;&amp;</b> C.S. Lewis</p>\n      <p>A fictional story about the afterlife.

Bounds</p>\n      <p>Short chapters, big ideas about prayer. With chapter titles such as \"Man's Most\n      Noble Exercise\", \"Talking to God for Men\", and \"The Secret of\n      Power\" this book motivates and educates on the least understood and most neglected\n      aspects of our relationship with God. </p>\n      <p><i>Spiritual Leadership</i>,<b>&amp;&amp;</b> Oswald Sanders</p>\n      <p>Sanders was a world class leader and trainer of Christians.

Along the way he runs into such characters as Worldly Wiseman, Ignorance, and Hope\n      with whom he dialogues. The many challenges that beset Christian, such as the Bog of\n      Despair and trying to climb Mount Sinai, provide relevance and perspective on the\n      Christian walk.</p>\n      <p><i>The Release of the Spirit</i>,<b>&amp;&amp;</b> Watchman Nee</p>\n      <p>Nee states that God cannot use you in this world until you are broken of your own will\n      and strength. Much like Paul in 2 Cor.&#xA0;12, Nee tells us how God's strength is\n      perfected in weakness, and he shows how the Holy Spirit can use us in powerful and\n      supernatural ways. This book is very challenging to Christian workers, especially if they\n      are going through hard times.</p>\n      <p><i>The Summons</i>,<b>&amp;</b> Dennis McCallum</p>\n      <p>A modern novel about a college Bible study that finds itself in the middle of God's\n      plan for their campus.

Hybels, an obviously effective Christian worker,\n      found that without prayer his life was dry and ineffective. He gives the reader some\n      practical advice on \"slowing down from 50,000 rpm to 5,000 rpm\" where you can\n      begin to hear the Spirit of the Lord and not just ask for things.</p>\n      <p><i>Understanding People</i>,<b>&amp;&amp;</b> Larry Crabb</p>\n      <p>Crabb's most thorough book describing his view of human nature, sin, spiritual and\n      emotional growth.

In contrast to the &#x201C;holiness&#x201D; of  the gods of the ancient world (Exod. 15:11), Yahweh is holy in an ethical  sense. Holiness relates most closely  with God&#x2019;s <em>righteousness</em>, God dwells  in &#x201C;unapproachable light&#x201D; (1 Tm. 6:16).</p>\n      <p>God&#x2019;s <em>justice</em> is necessary as a perfect moral Being: &#x201C;All have sinned and fallen short of the  glory of God&#x201D; (Rom. 3:23).</p>\n      <p>God&#x2019;s righteousness, his essential  holiness, also relates to <em>mercy</em>.

Man&#x2019;s purpose in life  was to be the serves of the gods... </p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p> Alexander  Heidel, <em>The Babylonian Genesis</em></p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p>It is small wonder,  therefore, that all polytheisms tend to be religions of the <em>status quo</em>, and that none of them has  ever produced a thoroughgoing social revolution based upon a high concept of  social justice... In the Bible, however, a state of tension exists between God  and creation... A profound disharmony exists between the will of god and the  existing social order. </p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p> G.

It brings focus to the reader that this is a  decisive, signature action of God&#x2014;that he will be known by his redeeming his  people from bondage! It is not that the  name Yahweh was unknown to God&#x2019;s people (Gen. 4:26), rather the character  imbedded in the name was yet to be realized (Gen. 17:1).

Yet, God will use this imperfect vessel for his purpose. <em></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Describe what the narrative teaches  about the human condition </em><em></em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>&#x201C;Fear  of the Lord&#x201D; (3:6). <em></em>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>The utter humility of  sinners before a holy God (see Isaiah 6:3&#x2014;5).  The expression &#x201C;fear of the Lord&#x201D; is used 124 times in the Old  Testament. It relates to &#x201C;amazement,&#x201D;  &#x201C;awe,&#x201D; and genuine &#x201C;fear.&#x201D;</p>\n      <p>Fear of the Lord guards  the heart (Hebrews 11:27; Isaiah 8:12&#x2014;14).  Who you fear is who you serve.  Indeed, the fear of the Lord produces persuasion (2 Cor. 5:11). </p>\n      <p>Fear of the Lord is the  basis for wisdom (Prov. 1:7). <em></em></p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </li>\n\n  <li>Total  inadequacy for the task <em></em>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>The narrative section  3:11&#x2014;4:17 focus on Moses&#x2019; objections to God&#x2019;s commission based on his complete  inadequacy for the task. God responds to  each of the four objections:</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>&#x201C;Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh?&#x201D; (3:11). God responds, &#x201C;I  will be with you&#x201D; and promises Moses a sign.</li>\n      <li> By what authority?  Or in whose name am I going? (3:13).  God  responds by using his  memorial name. </li>\n      <li>&#x201C;What if they don&#x2019;t believe me or listen to what I say?&#x201D;  (4:1). God  will use even a common stick to arrest their attention. </li>\n      <li>&#x201C;I  have never been eloquent of speech&#x201D; (4:10).  God will provide Aaron. <em></em></li>\n    </ul>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n  <li>God  will allow his people to be subject to the historical realities they face <em></em>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>Receiving  the promise land (3:8,17) will come through direct confrontation with Pharaoh  (3:19,20).</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Consider how the narrative reflects or  advances key theological themes in the OT.</em><em></em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Advancing  the Abrahamic Covenant. \n    <blockquote>\n      <p>We have seen that the  entire narrative is filled with reference to the Abrahamic Covenant. Fulfillment is coming!</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </li>\n\n  <li>Slavery  and redemption: key biblical theme of salvation. This text is really crucial to the  inter-textual hermeneutic. <em></em>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>13  times Isaiah alone refers to God as the <em>Redeemer</em>. The exodus from Egypt is the paradigm, or  model of redemption that will echo through Israel&#x2019;s history and overflow into  the New Testament. We have already seen  that exodus is a central <em>motif</em> in  biblical literature. <strong></strong></p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Application</strong> (skin) of the  narrative</p>\n\n<p><em>How the narrative instructs God&#x2019;s  people to be faithful to him.</em><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Biblical narrative relates both  to the original audience and to all of God&#x2019;s people throughout time (Deut. 6:4-9; Hebrews 11; Romans 15:4;  1 Corinthians 10:1&#x2014;6) </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>What  actions, attitudes, or convictions are being called for by the author to his  original audience? (cognitive, relational, and active elements of  application&#x2014;see Deut. 6:4&#x2014;9). In  narrative, application is closely tied to the human drama&#x2014;how are characters  presented? Should we be like them or  should we see in them a cautionary tale? </li>\n  <li>How do  these attitudes, convictions, or actions relate to us?\n    <ul>\n      <li>So  in what ways might we relate to Moses in Exodus 3 and 4? The main point of the narrative is clear: God  has come to deliver his people from Egypt (3:7), but that plan includes  Moses. In what way can we relate to his  situation? In what way can we relate to  his reactions? In what way are we  instructed through Moses?</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><em>Assignment:</em></strong> Exodus 15:1&#x2014;18 The Song of  Moses. This is a response in poetry and  song to the exodus. It highlights two  important dimensions of inductive study: <em>theology</em>&#x2014;what  it says about God and his plan for humanity, and <em>application</em>&#x2014;what is an appropriate response to God&#x2019;s  redemption. </p>\n\n<p> 1.  Identify and define each of the characteristics of God.</p>\n\n<p> 2.  In personal meditation on these characteristics, describe how two of  them   speak to your life today. How they challenge, clarify, or comfort  you. </p>\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Notes 3","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/hermeneutics/onlineclass/Notes/Notes3.htm"}

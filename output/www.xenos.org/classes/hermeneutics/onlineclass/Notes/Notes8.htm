Because of this sign, the crowd concludes  that Jesus is a prophet, perhaps like Moses in the wilderness (6:14). In contrasting John with the synoptic gospels  it is clear that the disciples did not understand the true significance of the  sign (Mark 6:52). Luke 9:12-17 and  Matthew 14:13-21 provide no comment on the crowd&#x2019;s or disciples&#x2019; response, but  in John 6, the sign is followed by detailed explanation of its meaning.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>By this time in  Jesus&#x2019; ministry, strong opposition existed (Jn. 5:58), but the crowds continued  to follow him. This extended dialogue  polarizes the masses (6:60,61,66), and leads to Peter&#x2019;s confession of faith (6:68,69). </li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Setting:</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Multitudes  follow Jesus to Capernaum after the feeding of the 5,000 (6:22&#x2014;25)</li>\n  <li>Jesus speaks in  the synagogue (6:59)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Structure:</em></p>\n<p>Note that the dialogue is framed around Jesus&#x2019;

(the crowd isn&#x2019;t getting the  force of the analogy&#x2014;they continue to seek bread for their stomachs and are  oblivious to the deep content of Jesus&#x2019; teaching)<em></em></p>\n<p><em>Answer</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><u>Truly</u>, unless you eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of Man you  have no life in yourselves.\n    <ul>\n      <li>He who eats my  flesh and drinks my blood has <strong>eternal  life</strong>, and I will <strong>raise him up on the  last day</strong>\n        <ul>\n          <li><u>for</u> my flesh is true food, and my blood true drink</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>He who eats my  flesh and drinks my blood abides in me and I in him</li>\n  <li>As the Father  sent me, and I live because of the Father, he who eats me will also live  because of me.</li>\n  <li>This is the  bread from heaven;

In what  sense(s) is the Old Testament being used?</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Manna. The crowd cites manna as a sign that God  authenticated Moses&#x2019; leadership, &#x201C;As it is written...&#x201D;, Psalm 78:24. Was this text cited by the crowd to incite  Jesus to another miracle to prove himself?  Perhaps. Certainly Psalm 78 is <em>ironic</em> in this context, as it refers to  manna primarily as a charge against the people for their unbelief (Ps. 78:22),  the very thing Jesus is also challenging. </li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is no  &#x201C;fulfillment&#x201D; language associated with the relationship of Jesus to the  manna. However, manna, or &#x201C;bread from  heaven&#x201D; is deeply symbolic of God&#x2019;s spiritual provision for his people:</p>\n  <p>&#x201C;He humbled you and let you be hungry, and fed you with manna which you  did not know, nor did your fathers know, that He might make you understand that  man does not live by bread alone, but by everything that proceeds out of the  mouth of the Lord.&#x201D; Deut. 8:3 (cf. Matt. 4:4)</p>\n  <p>The analogy  between Jesus and manna is easy to see in this extended dialogue: &#x201C;if this, how much more that&#x201D; <em>a fortiori</em> formula.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>urgently needed  to live &#x201C;life,&#x201D;  &#x201C;eternal life&#x201D;  </li>\n    <li>gift from God  coming down from heaven &#x201C;I am the  bread of life coming   down from heaven&#x201D;</li>\n    <li>free and  abundant the  &#x201C;work&#x201D; is to &#x201C;believe&#x201D;</li>\n    <li>accessible to  all &#x201C;he  who&#x201D;/&#x201D;everyone who&#x201D;   believes</li>\n    <li>Citing Isaiah  54:13 (6:45). The blessing of the last  days envisioned by Isaiah, though generically referred to by Jesus as &#x201C;the  prophets&#x201D; (plural), indicates that Jesus is not focusing on specific  prediction&#x2014;fulfillment, but in context, his unique authority to &#x201C;teach of God&#x201D;  given the unique Father/Son relationship Jesus has with God (6:45,46). He is not the son of Joseph (6:42), but far  more. &#x201C;It is written&#x201D; in this context  means, &#x201C;it applies.&#x201D; The last days are  present in Jesus&#x2019; pronouncement of the kingdom.</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n</blockquote>\n<p>Key theological terms:  </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Person of  Christ \n    <blockquote>\n      <p>Son of God&#x2014;a  messianic designation (Psalm 2)</p>\n      <p>&#x201C;I AM&#x201D;

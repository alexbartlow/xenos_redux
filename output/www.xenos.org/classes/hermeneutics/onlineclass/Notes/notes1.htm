There is a  supreme confidence in an ultimate coherence of meaning through language that  informs the biblical vision.&#x201D; </h4>\n</blockquote>\n<h4> Robert  Alter, <em>The Art of Biblical Narrative</em></h4>\n\n<p><em>The  gift of language.</em> Words are not just animal noises, like a bird  chirping or a cow mooing, that cause neuro-chemical responses for the purpose  of survival or reproduction. Words express <em>meaning</em> through propositions, or statements.  Words are a symbolic form of communication possible only for conscious, rational,  intentional beings concerned not merely with survival, but with the pursuit of the  lofty realities of truth, beauty, goodness, and love. Through language, a person understands their  inner life and discloses their thoughts and feelings to another. This ability is one of the evidences of  humanity&#x2019;s unique creation in God&#x2019;s image and is the basis for His revelation  to us. </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For an excellent  assessment of the relationship of language to the unique features of human consciousness  and intentionality, see John Searle, &#x201C;The Chinese Room.&#x201D; </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><em>God&#x2019;s word in creation</em>.  All that exists flows from the creative power of God&#x2019;s word. The Bible begins with the dramatic  pronouncement, &#x201C;God said... and it was... and it was good&#x201D; (Gen. 1:3&#x2014;31). So <em>life  itself reflects the ordered, rational structure of language</em>. Molecular biologist Francis Collins, Director  of the Human Genome Project writes, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"One can think of  DNA as an instructional script, a software program, sitting in the nucleus of  the cell. Its decoding language has only  four letters in its alphabet (A,C,T,G).  A particular instruction, a gene, is made up of hundreds or thousands of  letters of code&#x2026; All of the elaborate  functions of the cell, even in as complex an organism as ourselves, have to be  directed by the order of the letters in this script. Investigations of many  organisms, from bacteria to humans, reveal that this genetic code, by which  information is translated into protein, is universal in all known organisms. No  tower of Babel was to be allowed in the language of life.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong> </strong>Francis  Collins, <em>The Language of God</em></p>\n<p>The  scriptures teach that nature declares the creative, omnipotent power of God:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p> The heavens  proclaim the glory of God. The skies  declare the work of His hands. Day  to day pours forth speech, and night to night  reveals knowledge. Psalm 19:1.2 NLT </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>God&#x2019;s word in history.</em> The power of God&#x2019;s word in creation is also manifested in history, as we  will explore in greater detail with theological narratives. Old Testament prophets were careful to make  the connection between God&#x2019;s <em>omnipotent </em>word  in creation and his <em>sovereign </em>word in  history:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>  Thus says the Lord,  the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: &#x201C;Ask Me about the things to come  concerning My sons [history], and you shall commit to Me the work of My hands.  It is I who made the earth and created man upon it. I stretched out the heavens with My hands and  I ordained all their host. [nature]&#x201D;   Isaiah 45:11,12\n  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Revelation and  knowledge. </em>How could human beings, limited by  space and time, ever really know the eternal God unless He chose to make  Himself known? Philosophers and  religious sages have pondered the chasm separating time and eternity for  centuries, leaving twenty-first century people cynical that there can be any  real answer to our search. But what if  God has spoken? What if God took the  initiative to reach out into space and time to communicate? Then we would have a true basis for knowing. And this is the claim of scripture: God has  spoken and consequently, we can know God!</p>\n<p><em>Ways of knowing. </em>When  we say that we know something or someone, what do we really mean? What does it mean to <em>know</em>? <em>The Bible presents us with interrelated modes of knowledge, rooted in  how God created us as personal beings</em>. </p>\n<p>First,  God&#x2019;s word comes to us in the <em>propositional</em> terms of language, or <em>de dicto</em> knowledge. That is, truths <em>about</em> God are  revealed in the sentences of scripture.  These are statements of fact, meaning that they can be weighed against  the evidence of science, reason, experience, and history (see Luke 1:1&#x2014;4). </p>\n\n<p>Second,  scripture provides <em>wisdom</em>, or <em>de re</em> knowledge. Wisdom is the practical art of understanding  (Gr. <em>phronesis</em>) that comes from  living out the truths of scripture. Cultivating  wisdom brings forth awareness, an insight into the way things are, the essence  of things (Gr. <em>sophia</em>). Like an apprentice learning his craft from a  master, students of the Bible begin to think and assess life from God&#x2019;s  perspective, according to his priorities, creating clarity and a discerning eye  for life that results in blessing (Heb. 5:14; 1 Cor. 2:14; Ps. 1, 119). </p>\n\n<p>Third,  the scriptures cultivate <em>personal</em>, or <em>de se</em> knowing. That is, the scriptures  not only reveal truths <em>about</em> God, they  are also a means through which we can enjoy personal communion <em>with</em> God mediated by the Holy Spirit. That God&#x2019;s word is personal is evident in  Christ: the Word made flesh (John 1:1&#x2014;4).  The written word, like the incarnate Word, is personal communication  between God and His people.</p>\n<p><em>Word of God and the mind of man. </em>The  scripture is more than mere words on a page.  Biblical truth is &#x201C;living and active&#x201D; and able to expose the &#x201C;thoughts  and intentions of the heart&#x201D; (Heb. 4:12).  God communicates directly to our hearts and minds through His word. So scripture is &#x201C;food&#x201D; for the hungry (Deut.  8:3; 1 Pet. 2:2); a &#x201C;shield&#x201D; for the defenseless (Pr. 30:5); a &#x201C;sword&#x201D; for  spiritual combat (Eph. 6:17); a guide to the perplexed (Ps. 119:105,169).</p>\n<p><em>Word of God and the mind of God. </em>The awareness that scripture is &#x201C;God-breathed&#x201D;  (2 Tim. 3:16), that He speaks to us  through His living word is truly transforming.<em> </em>More remarkable still is the realization that  through the scripture, we actually think the very thoughts of God! This is worth a moment&#x2019;s reflection. All fields of knowledge seek ultimate  reality, ultimate answers. Physicists  try to form a &#x201C;theory of everything,&#x201D; philosophers seek timeless, universal  truth, religious seekers set out to discover transcendent reality. Humans by nature have a need deep within to  fully know. As Socrates lay dying, he  comforted his fellow seekers of truth saying, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[T]here is good  reason for anyone who reaches the end of this journey which lies before me to  hope that there, if anywhere, he will attain the object to which all of his  efforts have been directed during life... to the place where there is a  prospect of attaining the object of lifelong desire, which is Wisdom. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> Plato, <em>Phaedo</em></p>\n\n<p>Students  of the Bible, like Socrates, seek the Source of all truth. And the seeking is not without reward: Amazingly, through the scripture, we are  transported into the counsel of heaven (Rev. 4:1,2). Because we are indwelled by the Spirit, we  have the mind of Christ (1 Cor. 2:10&#x2014;16).  And like Moses at Sinai, we are transformed as we behold Him as in a  mirror (2 Cor. 3:18), eagerly anticipating the moment we will &#x201C;fully know, just  as we are fully known&#x201D; (1 Cor. 13:12).<em> </em>This is the extraordinary pleasure and  privilege of scripture&#x2014;to enter into the mind and heart of God! We really should view our time in God&#x2019;s word  as worship and preparation for eternity.</p>\n\n<p>For  a helpful discussion of the range of knowledge, see David Lewis, &#x201C;Attitudes De  Dicto and De Se,&#x201D; <em>Philosophical Review</em>,  88:513&#x2014;543. See also Michael Polanyi, <em>Personal Knowledge, 347&#x2014;380. </em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Stewardship of God&#x2019;s word</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>A sacred trust. </em>What  could be more precious than possessing God&#x2019;s word to humanity? For this reason, we are taught to &#x201C;guard&#x201D;  this &#x201C;treasure&#x201D; (1 Tim. 6:20; 2 Tim. 1:14).  Many people come in the name of God with all kinds of messages. But only in the Bible has God spoken. So as &#x201C;stewards of the mysteries of God&#x201D; (1  Cor. 4:1), God calls us to guard the scripture against those who distort its  meaning (1 Tim. 6:20,21; 2 Tim. 1:13,14).  That means we must know how to &#x201C;accurately divide the word of truth&#x201D; (2  Tim. 2:15). Our ability to interpret the scriptures  faithfully is a sacred task, something we must approach with humility and  rigor, along with the delight and joy of discovery.</p>\n<p>Further, we  are entrusted with God&#x2019;s word to encourage one another in the life of Christ  (Col. 3:16; Eph. 5:19; 2 Tim. 4:1&#x2014;4).  The church is to be a word-centered community and God calls us all to  make a contribution by using His word to infuse His perspective and liberating  truths in each others&#x2019; lives. And how  sweet it is to sense the reality of the Spirit granting insight into God&#x2019;s word  and sharing it with your brothers and sisters<em>.</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Interpreting the Bible </em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Purpose of interpretation</em>: <em>Discovering  the author&#x2019;s intended meaning</em>. Language  is about communication and we speak or write so we can be understood. Understanding happens when the message  received is a faithful representation of the message sent. It&#x2019;s the responsibility of the student of  scripture to stand under the author(ity) of scripture.</p>\n<p>Yet  meaning in language is not always clear.  Unlike mathematical calculation, words are somewhat ambiguous and  subject to <em>interpretation</em>&#x2014;there is  always a subjective aspect inherent in language. But of course it doesn&#x2019;t follow, as some  postmodern theorists have said, that all literature is like a Rorschach ink  blot, where the meaning is forever obscured by subjectivity, and rests totally on  each person&#x2019;s impression, that it&#x2019;s impossible to know what an author actually  means. Denying all objective meaning to  language is as ironic as it is absurd.  Some years ago, Madonna sang a song that went, &#x201C;Words are meaningless,  especially sentences&#x201D; (Madonna, &#x201C;Bed Time Stories&#x201D;). Surely she thought we&#x2019;d understand what she meant....  or did she? Are her lyrics meaningless?</p>\nWe can strive  for an ever more clear understanding of a text without having to possess  absolute certainty about its meaning. We  can gain <em>accurate</em>, but not <em>exhaustive</em> understanding. (note: W. Anderson&#x2019;s three umpires / doctor  looking at x-rays)\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For  a detailed discussion of &#x201C;authorial intent,&#x201D; see E. D. Hirsch, <em>Validity In Interpretation.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Process of interpretation</em>: <em>Inductive  method.</em> There are lots of productive  ways to study the Bible. <em>Topical</em> study looks for answers to  doctrinal questions like, &#x201C;What does the Bible teach about salvation?&#x201D; Most people read the Bible <em>devotionally</em>, sifting through the  scriptures, looking for truths that speak to inner needs or current  interests. But if the purpose is to  understand the author&#x2019;s intended meaning, we&#x2019;ll need the more disciplined  approach that inductive method supplies. </p>\n\n<p>Inductive  method is a way of reasoning used in all areas of life from practical problem  solving to the rigorous experimental methods of science. It is a common sense approach to giving an  explanation for observed data. For Bible  study, it is how interpreters take the data of the text and draw conclusions  about its intended meaning. Each  inductive study worksheet in this workbook is simply a systematic, step by step  application of two key inductive principles:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Principle:</strong> <em>Scripture  interprets scripture.</em> In inductive  reasoning, we look for <em>meaning drawn from  the text itself</em>, not some meaning imposed on it. <em>The  interpretative principles are found explicitly or assumed in the text</em>. Like detectives, Bible interpreters look to  the evidence of scripture for clues to its meaning. </p>\n\n<p>Within the  Bible we find hundreds of references and allusions to other passages that  provide a clear foundation for understanding how the text is meant to be understood. In this way, the Bible supplies its own  commentary, or guide to interpretation. Biblical  writers used techniques like <em>repetition </em>to  unify themes developed over hundreds of years by numerous authors. These repetitions are of four general types  and provide the core of <em>inter-textual  commentary</em>. </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Technical terms.</em> Words used by numerous biblical authors to convey the same idea or a  growing theme in the scripture:  &#x201C;Branch,&#x201D; &#x201C;Son,&#x201D; &#x201C;Servant,&#x201D; &#x201C;Day of the Lord,&#x201D; &#x201C;Christ,&#x201D; &#x201C;kingdom,&#x201D; &#x201C;temple,&#x201D;  &#x201C;grace,&#x201D; etc. </p>\n  <p><em>Event repetition.</em> Reference to key events, especially in Israel&#x2019;s history, that show a  continuity and pattern of meaning over time:  Exodus, creation, wilderness wandering, etc. This is called <em>motif</em>: the meaning of the present or future is defined in terms of a  past event.</p>\n  <p><em>Direct quotes or allusions.</em> Almost every biblical writer quotes or alludes to other biblical  texts. Careful analysis will show <em>how </em>a later author understood earlier  texts, thus shedding light on both the scripture cited and the passage in which  the citation occurs. </p>\n  <p><em>Promises and covenants</em>.  No other point of repetition demonstrates the unity of the Bible more explicitly  than promises and covenants. Key  promises God makes are cited or alluded to in every book of the Bible. </p>\n  <p>For  an excellent explanation of the concept of repetition as a literary and  theological technique and inter-textual commentary demonstrating continuity and  unity throughout the Bible, see Walter Kaiser, <em>Toward An Exegetical Theology;</em> Michael Fishbane, <em>Text and Texture</em> and <em>Biblical Interpretation in Ancient Israel</em>;  Richard Longnecker, <em>Biblical Exegesis in  the Apostolic Period</em>. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Principle:</strong><em> Interpretation is <u>testable</u></em> by the standards of inductive proof. </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Adequacy.</em> This criterion relates to <em>completeness</em>. Does the interpretation explain all of the  details of the text? Are all subordinate  points meaningfully related to the main point?</p>\n  <p><em>Consistency</em>.  This criterion relates interpretation to <em>relevant factual information</em>. Has the interpretation effectively considered  current cultural factors? Is the  interpretation consistent with historical events to which the text refers? What does the text state or imply about  nature?</p>\n  <p><em>Coherence</em>.  This criterion tests the <em>internal  logic</em> of the interpretation and focuses attention on the <em>structure</em> of the text. Does the interpretation harmonize with other  related scriptures? Does the  interpretation include an appropriate understanding of literary context and  genre, word meaning, and sentence structure? What is the basic argument of the text?</p>\n  <p> For  a detailed description of inductive proof, see Patrick Hurley, <em>A Concise Introduction to Logic</em>, 440&#x2014;456. \n  </p>\n</blockquote>\nBiblical  interpretation, like all literary interpretation, is a skill developed over  time. It&#x2019;s part art, part science. The key to enjoying the process is to relax  and build your strength over time.  Progress, not perfection, is the issue.  I find the words of Old Testament scholar Walter Kaiser as encouraging  today as when I first sat under his teaching:\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&#x201C;[The]  aspiring exegete needs to have a patient persistence, a disciplined mind and  methodology, a confidence motivated by a personal faith and born of a hunger to  experience firsthand the transforming impact of what is discovered in the text. Rewarding results will come only if the  search is sustained by an enthusiastic joy of discovery through the long hours  of hard and patient work. And in all, it  must be tempered by the experience of prayer and suffering. The exegetical route is not easy; it requires  a lot of work, but in the end it is just as rewarding as it is awesome in its  initial demands.&#x201D;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Walter Kaiser, <em>Toward An  Exegetical Theology</em>\n</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Inductive Study Worksheet: Old Testament Narrative</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>\n<p><em>Summarize the historical  situation, the main themes of the book and its place in the OT story</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Structure</strong> (skeleton) of the individual  narrative</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Identify  and chart <em>each scene</em> in the narrative:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"238\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>setting</strong><strong> </strong></p></td>\n    <td width=\"221\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>plot and dialogue</strong><strong> </strong></p></td>\n    <td width=\"221\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>purpose clues</strong><strong> </strong></p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"238\" valign=\"top\">\n      <p><em>Context:</em></p>\n      \n      <p>briefly    summarize narratives coming before and    after </p>\n      \n      <p><em>Identify:</em></p>\n      \n      <p><u>who</u>&#x2014;characters </p>\n      <p><u>where</u>&#x2014;location </p>\n      <p><u>when</u>&#x2014;time </p>\n      \n      <p>(shifts    in setting signal shifts from one scene to another) </p>\n      \n      \n      </td>\n    <td width=\"221\" valign=\"top\">\n      <p><em>Narration:</em></p>\n      <p><u>how</u> the story is told</p>\n      \n      \n      <p>&#x201C;point    of view&#x201D; </p>\n      <p> space &amp; tempo </p>\n      <p> editorial insertions: </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>introduction </li>\n        <li>conclusion </li>\n        <li>clarification </li>\n        <li>evaluations </li>\n      </ul>\n      \n      \n      <p><u>why</u> actions &amp; people matter</p>\n      \n      <p><em>Action:</em></p>\n      \n      <p>plot    movement and character development </p>\n      \n      <p><em>Dialogue:</em></p>\n      \n      <p>summarize    the flow of conversation </p></td>\n    <td width=\"221\" valign=\"top\">\n      <p><em>Identify:</em></p>\n      <p><u>what</u> the story is really about</p>\n      \n      <p>often    the <em>main point</em> of the narrative is    found from these clues:</p>\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      <ul>\n        <li>decisive or symbolic actions </li>\n      </ul>\n      \n      \n      \n      </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>state  the <em><u>main point</u></em> and how each  scene supports, illustrates, or applies it</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Content</strong><strong> (</strong>muscle) of the  narrative</p>\n\n\n<p>identify customs, objects, events, and  persons relevant to the story</p>\n<p><em></em><em>Theology:</em></p>\n<p>Identify  and define key theological terms or concepts</p>\n<p>What  the narrative teaches about God&#x2019;s nature or the plan of salvation</p>\n<p>What  the narrative teaches about the human condition </p>\n<p>How  the narrative reflects or advances key theological themes in the OT</p>\n\n<p><strong>Application</strong> (skin) of the narrative</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>How  the narrative instructs God&#x2019;s people to be faithful to him<strong> </strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What Is Old Testament Narrative?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em></em></strong><em>Narrative in scripture</em></p>\n<p><em></em>Narratives are stories told by  a narrator and which include substantial elements of dialogue. Genesis&#x2014;Esther  and substantial parts of many of the prophets are narratives. </p>\n<p><strong><em></em></strong><strong><em>I. Old Testament  narrative as history</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>History vs. myth</em></p>\n<p><em></em>It has been widely taught that  the narratives of the Old Testament are basically nationalistic myths, not  intended to be taken historically or factually.  This view emerged out of the critical scholarship of Europe in the 19<sup>th</sup> century and was rooted in the assumption that the miraculous is impossible and  that the Bible was the product of cultural evolution. However, several reasons exist to view Old  Testament narratives as written from the perspective of history. <em>First</em>,  these narratives are cited all over the Bible, both in the Old Testament and  the New as history. <em>Second</em>, the idea that we should view these narratives as myth  unless corroborated by archaeology is an unfounded assumption not applied to  any other purportedly historical account. <em>Third</em>, the literary style of  Old Testament narrative is significantly different than the characteristics  found in the obviously non-historical mythology of Israel&#x2019;s neighbors.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&#x201C;The ancient Hebrew writers  purposefully nurtured and developed prose narration to take the place of the  epic genre which by its content was intimately bound up with the world of  paganism, and appears to have had a special standing in the polytheistic cults.  The recitation of the epics was tantamount to an enactment of cosmic events in  the manner of sympathetic magic. In the process of total rejection of the  polytheistic religions and their ritual expressions in the cult, epic songs and  also the epic genre were purged from the repertoire of the Hebrew  authors.&#x201D; </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Shemaryahu Talmon, &#x201C;The  Comparative Method in Biblical Interpretation&#x2014;Principles and Problems,&#x201D; in  Robert Alter, <em>Art of Biblical Narrative. </em></p>\n<p><em>Narrative as apologetic</em></p>\n<p><em></em>A key purpose of Old Testament  narrative is to contrast the actually existing God of Israel, a God capable of  acting in history, with the nonexistent animistic deities worshipped in the  ancient near east. (see 1 Kings 18; Isaiah 46:1&#x2014;11; 40:18&#x2014;24) </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>  Biblical faith is a challenge to commitment, and  even the historical literature as we have it was edited, preserved, and for the  most part originally written with this definite evangelical purpose. Decide on  the evidence and act accordingly! What  is the evidence? It is the evidence of  history. What God has the power to do  what he wills and to fulfill what he promises?  Virtually the only comparative religion which the Old Testament  possesses is of this type. \n  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> G. Ernest Wright, <em>The Old Testament Against It&#x2019;s Environment</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For  examples of comparison and analysis of OT historical narratives and  mythological sagas of the ancient near east, see Alexander Heidel, <em>The Babylonian Genesis</em>; James Prichard, <em>The Ancient Near East: An Anthology of Texts  and Pictures, </em>vol. 1,2; Bruce Waltke, <em>Creation and Chaos</em>, 5&#x2014;17 and <em>Genesis</em>, 21&#x2014;78; Henri Blocher, <em>In The Beginning</em>, 15&#x2014;38. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em></em><em>Hebrew concept of  &#x201C;linear time&#x201D; </em></p>\n<p><em></em>The  Bible stands in startling contrast with all ancient conceptions of time. Following the cycle of nature, Mesopotamian,  Egyptian, Greek, African, Mayan, and Chinese writing from antiquity described  history as a wheel or circle. Time leads  to nothing, but just repeats the endless turning from season to season, life to  death. However, in the biblical view, <em>history progresses through a meaningful and  coherent drama toward an end</em>.  Without this notion of linear time, concepts like &#x201C;progress&#x201D; or  &#x201C;meaning&#x201D; or &#x201C;purpose&#x201D; are inconceivable. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Creation and  election, promise and fulfillment, were the means by which history was  interpreted. Thus it came about that the biblical sense of history was  born. The contemporary polytheisms,  having analyzed the problem of life over against nature, had little sense of or  concern with the significance of history.  Nature with its changing seasons was cyclical, and human life,  constantly integrating itself with nature by means of cultic activity and  sympathetic magic, moved with nature in a cyclical manner. ... [But] Yahweh was  the God of history, the living God unaffected by the cycles of nature, who had  set himself to accomplish a definite purpose in time... Both beginning and end,  creation and eschatology, therefore, became an integral part of the Israelite  view of time. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> G.

Old Testament narrative as  theology</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Prophetic history</em></p>\n<p><em></em>Historical narratives of the  Old Testament were <em>written by prophets to  demonstrate the faithfulness of God to his promises in and sovereignty over  human history</em> (see 2 Chron. 32:32; cf. Isaiah 36&#x2014;39; 2 Kings 18&#x2014;20). So historical narratives are written for a  deliberate theological purpose. <em></em></p>\n<p><em>Unfolding God&#x2019;s plan </em></p>\n<p><em></em>Remember the former things long  past, for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is no one like  Me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things which  have not been done, saying, &#x201C;My purpose will be established, and I will  accomplish My good pleasure; calling a bird of prey form the east, the man of  My purpose from a far country. Truly I  have spoken; truly I will bring it to pass.  I have planned it, surely I will do it.&#x201D;  Isaiah 46:9&#x2014;11 </p>\nOld Testament narratives are  interrelated, progressing accounts of <u>what</u> God&#x2019;s purpose for history is  and <u>how</u> He intends to accomplish it. \n\n<p><img width=\"513\" src=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/hermeneutics/Onlineclass/Notes/graphics/image001.gif\"></p>\n<p><strong><em>III. Old Testament narrative as literature</em></strong></p>\n<p>Narrative&#x2019;s  theology points to the literary center, the <strong><em>main point</em></strong> of the story.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Principle</u></strong><strong>:</strong> Theological narrative is <em>selective</em> and <em>purposeful</em>. Events and persons anchored in history are to  be understood in relation to main stated or implied theological point of the  narrative.\n</p>\n<p><strong><u>Principle</u></strong>: The main point of any particular narrative is  based on its relationship to the broader structure of the canonical whole. This is much like understanding a particular  act of a play in the context of the whole story.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><u>Implication</u>: Interpreters must <em>inductively</em> identify the theological <em>framework</em> or structure of Old Testament narrative&#x2014;<em>derived from the text itself</em>. </p>\n  <p><u></u><em>How we  know what the story is about: </em>Key theological statements serve as &#x201C;<strong>markers</strong>,&#x201D; or literary centers to OT  narrative. Meaning of the narrative is  rooted in these theological statements: </p>\n</blockquote><ul>\n  <li>Blessings&#x2014;<em>Be</em>: &#x201C;Be fruitful and multiply and fill  the earth&#x201D; Genesis 1:28.</li>\n  <li>Covenants&#x2014;Law  of Moses (Exodus 20ff); the New Covenant (Jeremiah 31)  </li>\n  <li>Promises&#x2014;<em>I will</em>: Unconditional statements of  God&#x2019;s intent (see below)\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Two key theological markers as structural  literary centers of Old Testament narrative:</em></p>\n<p>Genesis  12:1&#x2014;3 God&#x2019;s promise to Abraham\n</p>\n<p>2  Samuel 7:8&#x2014;17 God&#x2019;s covenant with David\n</p>\n<p><img width=\"616\" src=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/hermeneutics/Onlineclass/Notes/graphics/image002.gif\"></p>\n\n<p><em>Abrahamic Promise</em> as structural center of Genesis&#x2014;Joshua narrative</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Blessing  on Abraham</p>\n  <p>Nationhood </p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n  <li>Gen.  15&#x2014;Exodus 19: Forming a people</li>\n  <li>Exodus  20&#x2014;40, Leviticus, Deuteronomy: Ruling a people</li>\n  <li>Joshua:  Inheriting the land</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Davidic Covenant</em> as structural center of Judges&#x2014;2 Chronicles</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Judges,  Ruth, 1 Samuel: Preparation for monarchy\n  </p>\n  <p>2  Samuel 7&#x2014;24 (1 Chron. 17&#x2014;29): God&#x2019;s blessing on David\n  </p>\n  <p>1 Kings  1&#x2014;11 (2 Chron. 1&#x2014;9): God&#x2019;s faithfulness to Solomon\n  </p>\n  <p>1 Kings  12&#x2014;2 Kings 25 (2 Chron. 10&#x2014;36): God&#x2019;s faithfulness to David&#x2019;s line\n  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See Walter Kaiser, <em>Toward An Old Testament Theology</em>, 41&#x2014;70 </p>\n\n<p><em>Essential markers controlling  Old Testament development can be recognized in the promise, blessing, covenant  theme:</em></p>\nSalvation History Through The Old      Testament \n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"216\" valign=\"top\"><p>Era:</p></td>\n    <td width=\"90\" valign=\"top\"><p>Date:</p></td>\n    <td width=\"138\" valign=\"top\"><p>Book(s):</p></td>\n    <td width=\"150\" valign=\"top\"><p>Historic        Events:</p></td>\n    <td width=\"186\" valign=\"top\"><p>Key        Theological Markers:</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"216\" valign=\"top\">\n      <p> Prehistory </p>\n      \n      \n      </td>\n    <td width=\"90\" valign=\"top\"></td>\n    <td width=\"138\" valign=\"top\">\n      <p>Genesis        1&#x2014;11 </p></td>\n    <td width=\"150\" valign=\"top\"><ul>\n      <li>Creation</li>\n      <li>Fall</li>\n      <li>Flood</li>\n      <li>Babel scattering </li>\n    </ul></td>\n    <td width=\"186\" valign=\"top\"><ul>\n      <li>Creation blessing</li>\n      <li>Adam Covenant</li>\n      <li>Seed blessing</li>\n      <li>Shem blessing</li>\n    </ul></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"216\" valign=\"top\">\n      <p> Patriarchal Era</p>\n      \n      \n      </td>\n    <td width=\"90\" valign=\"top\">\n      <p>2160&#x2014;1876        B.C.</p></td>\n    <td width=\"138\" valign=\"top\">\n      <p>Genesis        12&#x2014;50 </p></td>\n    <td width=\"150\" valign=\"top\"><ul>\n      <li>Call of Abraham</li>\n      <li>Four generations from Abraham</li>\n    </ul></td>\n    <td width=\"186\" valign=\"top\"><ul>\n      <li>Covenant with Abraham</li>\n      <li>Heirs</li>\n      <li>Land</li>\n      <li>Judah blessing</li>\n    </ul></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"216\" valign=\"top\">\n      <p> Egyptian Captivity and </p>\n      <p> Exodus</p>\n      </td>\n    <td width=\"90\" valign=\"top\">\n      <p>1876&#x2014;1446        B.C.</p></td>\n    <td width=\"138\" valign=\"top\">\n      <p>Exodus,        Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy </p></td>\n    <td width=\"150\" valign=\"top\"><ul>\n      <li>Moses</li>\n      <li>Plagues</li>\n      <li>Exodus</li>\n      <li>Law</li>\n      <li>Wanderings</li>\n    </ul></td>\n    <td width=\"186\" valign=\"top\"><ul>\n      <li>God remembers and redeems</li>\n      <li>Mosaic Law</li>\n      <li>Nation of priests</li>\n      <li>Sub.

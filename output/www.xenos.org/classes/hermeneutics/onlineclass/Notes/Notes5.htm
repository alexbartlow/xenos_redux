Is there an end in reference to which we can measure the significance of  our own lives? Is there any reason for  hope? Is there justice in the  universe? Where is God in all this  chaos? Through the word of the Lord,  visions and dreams, biblical prophets reveal the plan of God for history. The prophets proclaim salvation along four  lines, each deeply connected with the others. </p>\n<p><strong><em></em></strong><strong><em>&#x201C;Day of the Lord&#x201D;</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em></em></strong> Prophetic book  Use of term<strong> </strong></p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"126\" valign=\"top\"><h5><em>Joel</em></h5>\n      <p>1:15</p>\n      <p>2:1</p>\n      <p>2:2</p>\n      <p>2:11</p>\n      <p>2:31</p>\n      <p>3:1</p>\n      <p>3:18</p></td>\n    <td width=\"408\" valign=\"top\">\n      \n      <p>Destruction    from the Almighty</p>\n      <p>Cause to    tremble soon approaching</p>\n      <p>Unparalleled    time of gloom</p>\n      <p>Dreadful    coming of the Lord&#x2019;s army&#x2014;who can endure?</p>\n      <p>Great and    dreadful, cosmic imagery</p>\n      <p>A day of    blessing for Judah</p>\n      <p>A day of    blessing for Judah and judgment on Egypt</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"126\" valign=\"top\"><h5><em>Obadiah</em></h5>\n      <p>1:8</p>\n      <p>1:11</p>\n      <p>1:12</p>\n      <p>1:13</p>\n      <p>1:14</p>\n      <p>1:15</p></td>\n    <td width=\"408\" valign=\"top\">\n      \n      <p>Edom    destroyed (Esau)</p>\n      <p>Denunciation    of Edom for assault on Jerusalem</p>\n      <p>Day of    Judah&#x2019;s destruction</p>\n      <p>Day of    Jerusalem&#x2019;s destruction</p>\n      <p>Denunciation    of Edom</p>\n      <p>A day of    distress and accountability for the nations</p>\n      </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"126\" valign=\"top\"><h5><em>Zephaniah</em></h5>\n      <p>1:7</p>\n      <p>1:8</p>\n      <p>1:9</p>\n      <p>1:10</p>\n      <p>1:14</p>\n      <p>1:15</p>\n      <p>1:16</p>\n      <p>1:18</p>\n      <p>2:2</p>\n      <p>2:3</p>\n      <p>3:8</p>\n      <p>3:11</p>\n      <p>3:16</p></td>\n    <td width=\"408\" valign=\"top\">\n      \n      <p>Sacrifice    prepared for those invited</p>\n      <p>Judgment on    the nations</p>\n      <p>Judgment on    the nations</p>\n      <p>Cries from    Jerusalem</p>\n      <p>The Lord    comes as a warrior</p>\n      <p>Day of    wrath</p>\n      <p>Day of    battle</p>\n      <p>End of    world history</p>\n      <p>Day of the    Lord&#x2019;s wrath, appointed by God</p>\n      <p>Seek the    Lord in that day, and repent</p>\n      <p>Day of    judgment for the nations</p>\n      <p>Israel to    be vindicated</p>\n      <p>Jerusalem    to be vindicated</p>\n      </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nThe day of the Lord is a term used  broadly by the prophets to describe <em>the  in-breaking of God in history</em>. It is  not one event, but many. Prophecies  are framed in terms of &#x201C;the day&#x201D;; &#x201C;in that day&#x201D;; &#x201C;the day of the Lord&#x201D;; &#x201C;the day is  coming&#x201D;;  &#x201C;days are coming.&#x201D;  These related expressions are used 250 times by the prophets and are central to their  conception of the unfolding of history.  The Day of the Lord <em>erupts</em> at  key moments in salvation history as God&#x2019;s plan is <em>filling</em> and moving toward ultimate <em>fulfillment</em>. \n<blockquote>\n  <p>The day of the Lord is sometimes  presented in cosmic (apocalyptic) imagery to express the awesomeness of the  event. See Joel 1:15; 2:2,11,30,31. </p>\n  <p>The day of the Lord is both <em>near</em> and <em>far</em>. It is about to occur  and it will occur at the end of history.  The day of the Lord in the Old Testament shares deep similarities with  the New Testament teaching of the kingdom of God. It is the &#x201C;already/not yet&#x201D; dynamic of  history. The day of the Lord is  imminent, but it is a shadow of the day that is coming. </p>\n  <p>The day of the Lord is a time of  judgment for those opposing God and his people and a time of salvation and  blessing for those who look to the Lord.</p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><u>Example of the day of the Lord:</u></p>\n    <p>Joel 2:1&#x2014;11.  The  day of the Lord is near, a time of destruction for God&#x2019;s   people in Zion.</p>\n    <p>Joel 2:12&#x2014;17  A call for the guilty to repent.</p>\n    <p>Joel 2:18&#x2014;27  Blessings of God to his people will come.</p>\n    <p>Joel 2:28&#x2014;3:3 &#x201C;After this&#x201D; the day of the Lord in cosmic imagery,  universal   dimensions, era of the Spirit&#x2019;s  presence on all, salvation  offered  to all, restoration of Zion&#x2019;s stature; the nations will be  gathered  in judgment (cf. Acts 2:16-21).</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><em>Fulfilling the Abrahamic and Davidic promises. </em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Abrahamic  Promise fulfilled: &#x201C;All the nations called by my name&#x201D; </em>(Amos  9:12)&#x2014;<em>the</em> <em>nations share in God&#x2019;s promise to Israel. </em>Remember that God&#x2019;s purpose in calling  Abraham is that &#x201C;in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed&#x201D; (Gen.  12:3) just as they had been dispersed in judgment (Gen. 11:1-9). Salvation thus takes on universal scope. While the nations surrounding Israel had  their gods, the Lord is the true sovereign of all. Throughout Israel&#x2019;s history God&#x2019;s intent for  the nations had been expressed, as for instance in Jonah 4:2,11. Surely it is within this context that we are  to understand Jesus&#x2019; commission to make disciples of all peoples (Matt. 28:19). Promise oracles are often characterized by  the global dimensions of God&#x2019;s salvation and judgment (see Micah 4:1-4). Amazingly, history concludes with the scene  in heaven in which &#x201C;people from every tribe and tongue and people and nation&#x201D;  have become a &#x201C;kingdom and priests to God&#x201D; (Rev. 5:9,10, cf. Ex. 19:6). </p>\n<p><em>Davidic Promise fulfilled: An eternal and universal  kingdom. </em>How  was God going to bless all the families of the earth? Through the extraordinary promise of God to  David (2 Samuel 7:8-17). Because of the  central importance of this covenant to the promise oracles, let&#x2019;s focus on the  key elements as it is developed in the Old Testament. <em></em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>David&#x2019;s       kingdom is<em> everlasting</em> (see 2       Sam. 23:5; Ps. 89:28, 29&#x2026;). </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n  <li>God&#x2019;s kingdom       and David&#x2019;s kingdom are one (see 1 Chron. 28:5). Nowhere is the connection between the       kingdom of David and the kingdom of God more evident than in the &#x201C;Royal       Psalms.&#x201D;\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>Psalm 2. This Psalm contrasts the kings of the earth  who oppose God (2:1,2) with the Lord&#x2019;s <em>Anointed</em> (2:3) who reigns as both King and Son of God. </p>\n      <p>Psalm 89. Here the covenant with David is commemorated  and the reaffirmation that David&#x2019;s seed, or descendant would be established  forever on his throne (89:3). Yet the  king &#x201C;belongs to the Holy One of Israel&#x201D; (89:18). </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </li>\n  <li>  Jerusalem       is both the &#x201C;city of David&#x201D; (2 Sam. 5:7,9) and the God&#x2019;s dwelling (1 Kings       11:13; 14:21; 2 Kings 19:34; 20:6) and the place from which God rules       (Micah 4:1-5).</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n  <li>A unique Davidic ruler (anointed,  messiah). God is faithful to his promise  and while David&#x2019;s sons will be disciplined (2 Sam. 7:14), the promise is  irrevocable, based on God&#x2019;s sworn word.  So as history reaches its climactic moment, the Davidic King comes to  rule from Zion over the nations (see  Ezekiel 37:24&#x2014;27). \n    <blockquote>\n      <p>The Davidic messiah is sometimes called <em>Branch</em> (or &#x201C;sprig,&#x201D; &#x201C;root,&#x201D; &#x201C;stem,&#x201D;  &#x201C;shoot&#x201D;). See Jeremiah 23:3&#x2014;6; 33:15;  Isaiah 11:1; Zech. 3:8; 6:12. </p>\n      <p>Messiah from David is uniquely God&#x2019;s  Son (Psalm 110:4) and indeed described in terms of <em>divinity</em> (Micah 5:2; Isaiah 9:6-8).</p>\n      <p>The unique Davidic anointed One not  only rules, but also serves a <em>priestly  role </em>as well (Psalm 110:4; Zech. 6:12,13; Isaiah 52:15).</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><em>New Covenant: from shadow to substance.</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p>\n<p>The New Covenant (see Jeremiah 31:31-34). Like the fulfillment of the Abrahamic and  Davidic Covenants, the New Covenant is intimately joined to the day of the  Lord. It is God&#x2019;s covenant &#x201C;in that day&#x201D;  (Jer. 31:31,33; Is. 42:6; 49:8; 59:21; Hos. 2:18&#x2014;20).</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>It will be an <em>everlasting</em> covenant&#x201D; (Is. 24:5; 55:3; 61:8; Jer. 32:40; 50:5;  Ezek. 37:26)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n  <li>Rooted in <em>internal</em> obedience, not external conformity to the letter of the  Mosaic law. Provisions of the New  Covenant are a &#x201C;new heart,&#x201D; a &#x201C;new spirit&#x201D; (Jer. 32:39; Ezek. 11:19, 18:31;  36:26). Under the New Covenant, God  works through his Spirit (Joel 3:28,29).  Forgiveness from sin (Jer. 31:34) and deep relationship (Jer. 32:41)  form the heart of the New Covenant. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n  <li>Planned <em>obsolescence</em> of the &#x201C;Old Covenant&#x201D;       (Jer. 3:16,17)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n  <li>In the Old covenant the tabernacle is a  &#x201C;model&#x201D; of the heavenly, but in the New, the <em>substance</em> is present&#x2014;the symbol no longer needed. Remember that God&#x2019;s true concern has always  been the heart (Psalm 51:10-12), not external ritual (see Psalm 51:16,17; Hos.  6:6)\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>God&#x2019;s presence is associated with the  ark (2 Sam. 6:2; 2 Kings 19:15).</p>\n      <p>Moses&#x2019; ark is a &#x201C;model&#x201D; (Exod. 25:9,40;  26:30; 27:8).</p>\n      <p>God will be present with his people  directly (Ezek. 37:26,27), no longer mediated by mere temple activity (Rev.  21:3,22).</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Fulfilling history.</em></strong></p>\nThe future <em>unfolds</em>,  or <em>completes</em> the past&#x2014;fulfilling the historical  flow of God&#x2019;s redemptive acts. The  details, language, and imagery of the great narratives of the Old Testament are  brought into the ongoing drama of history through the prophets. <em>The  future is often painted in the hues of the past to show continuity in God&#x2019;s plan</em>,  and <em>to demonstrate that He who acted in  the past is the One who will bring history to its completion</em>.\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Regeneration</em>: Creation       and a new heaven and earth (Isaiah 65:17; Rom. 8:18-23; Rev. 21:1;       22:1-5). God brings life from       death. Elements of the creation       narrative are used by the prophets to express both the problem of       humanity, and the hope of new life. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Redemption</em>: Historical       deliverance reaches its fullness in universal redemption (Isaiah 11; 19). The Bible&#x2019;s story is, at the core, a       redemption story. Exodus imagery       provides the backdrop for much of the prophets&#x2019; message (Hos. 11:1; Jer.       16:14). </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Reconciliation</em>: The problem starts with rebellion and       man evicted from Eden, away from the presence of God. But the story is not over, as God       maintains his touchstone to humanity.       Ultimately the &#x201C;Father/son&#x201D; relationship of God to Israel will       widen to &#x201C;all the nations called by my name&#x201D; (Amos 9:12) and into New Testament       teaching, as the &#x201C;grafted in&#x201D; gentiles join as one with Israel to form the       new &#x201C;Israel of God&#x201D; (Gal. 6:16). </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><em></em></strong><strong><em>Oracle Structure</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em></em></strong>As with all genres, interpretation of prophetic literature  involves capturing the thought process of the author, the organization of the  ideas that make up the text. We have  seen with Old Testament narratives that certain techniques were used to guide  the reader into an understanding of the main point of the story&#x2014;repetition,  dramatic realization, etc.&#x2014;and how the main point was supported by each scene  in the narrative. These narrative techniques are sometimes used by the prophets  too, especially in those oracles that are rooted in a narrative context.</p>\n<p><em>Here  are some tips for identifying the main point and how it is supported: </em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Notice  repetition of key words</em> that relate to the basis of Israel&#x2019;s  blessing and judgment rooted in the Mosaic Law, and key terms used in promise  oracles. This will tell you what the  oracles are about. Usually, that&#x2019;s the  main point&#x2014;oracles are describing God&#x2019;s activity in history in relation to  these concepts. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Recognize  allusion to or quote from Old Testament narrative</em> that brings an important idea from the past into a fresh situation.

Where metaphorical or highly figurative       language is being used, what are the clues to meaning? Usually, the text itself provides the       meaning. For instance, the       symbolism of Daniel&#x2019;s dreams are interpreted by Daniel himself (Dan.       2:31-45). Sometimes an image is       given, then applied in such a way that the connection between the symbolic       image and historical events is clear (Jer. 18:1-12; Amos 7:1&#x2014;8:14). </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong></strong><strong><em>Theology </em></strong><em></em></p>\n<p><em>Salvation:  What does the oracle teach about God&#x2019;s program on earth? </em>How does the oracle relate to the plan  of salvation?

While humans tend to accommodate sin, God  does not. Interpreters should describe  the human condition in terms of its failures, suffering, value and virtue. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Unity</em></strong></p>\n<p><em></em><em>What kind of  prophetic fulfillment is being used?</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em></em><em>Motif/Type.</em> The future unfolds the past, showing the continuity of salvation history  through fulfilled covenants, events, people and objects. Consequently, prophets may speak of both the <em>present</em> and the <em>future</em> in the same terms even in the same oracle. <em>The  &#x201C;overflowing into the future&#x201D;</em> pattern is the most common way of predicting  the future. <em>The prophet&#x2019;s message is about the character or nature of the future  more than when it will occur</em>. We  have already noted this pattern in the exodus and creation motifs and will  explore this kind of prophetic fulfillment in greater detail when we study the  gospels and the New Testament&#x2019;s use of the Old Testament.</p>\n  <p><em>Prediction/fulfillment</em>. The prophets &#x201C;see&#x201D; the future through visions  or words from the Lord. But usually the  distant future and the near future are described together&#x2014;that the short-term  future of Israel is a picture of what the end of history looks like, as though  near-term events presage the culmination of history. Or, alternatively, the end of history  provides the language and images to describe the near-term future (see Joel 2:1,2). That is in keeping with the  &#x201C;day of the Lord&#x2019; imagery so common with the prophets. For the interpreter it means that when  looking at oracles, it&#x2019;s important to consider whether the prophet is speaking  of the near future, the culmination of history, or both.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n  <ul>\n    <li><u>multiple reference prediction</u></li>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n<p><img width=\"133\" src=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/hermeneutics/Onlineclass/Notes/graphics/image003.gif\"><img width=\"287\" src=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/hermeneutics/Onlineclass/Notes/graphics/image004.gif\"></p>\n<p> Prophet&#x2019;s  Day as nation repents/Resettlement after captivity/End  of History</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p><em>semantic clues</em> (then, and  then): Joel 2:28</p>\n      <p><em>temporal clues</em>&#x2014;things said  that could not be true of the historical description at hand; verb tenses: Daniel 9:26</p>\n      <p><em>content clues</em>&#x2014;descriptions  that relate to the <em>universal</em> &amp; <em>eternal</em>, rather than merely covenant  blessings on Israel.

The clearer these themes are  understood, the more able interpreters will be to grasp narrative flow and  place individual narratives in their proper interpretative framework. The controlling theme, usually stated but  sometimes implied, is an &#x201C;umbrella&#x201D; under which all of the narratives of the  book fit together.</p>\nControlling theme as a <em>theological marker </em>(promise, covenant,  blessing), repeated or alluded to throughout the narrative. \n<p><strong></strong><strong><u>Example: Genesis 12&#x2014;36: God&#x2019;s  faithfulness to His promise to Abraham</u></strong></p>\n12:1&#x2014;3 Promise of blessing to  Abraham, a nation, all humanity while   Abram is still in Ur.\n<p>12:7 Reaffirming the land  blessing as Abraham travels to Canaan.</p>\n<p>13:14&#x2014;17 After Abraham redeems Lot from  Sodom</p>\n<p>15:4&#x2014;7 Clarification: From your  own body will the promised son come.</p>\n<p>15:13&#x2014;21 Promise becomes a unilateral  Covenant&#x2014;notice land dimensions</p>\n<p>16:10 Ishmael is blessed as  a son of Abraham</p>\n<p>17:2&#x2014;8 Abram becomes Abraham;  circumcision is the sign of covenant.</p>\n<p>17:16 Sarah is to be blessed</p>\n<p>17:19&#x2014;21 Isaac to be born; God will  establish His covenant with Isaac.</p>\n<p>18:18,19 Purpose of the promise:  legacy of justice and righteousness.</p>\n<p>21:12 Isaac is the son of  covenant, not Ishmael.</p>\n<p>22:17,18 Reaffirming the covenant  after Abraham&#x2019;s obedience at Mt.

Consequently the  prophet-author of Kings (see 2 Chron. 32:32) assesses kings in terms of their  obedience/disobedience to God. </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Controlling theme as a <em>repeated phrase</em>: 2 Kings 3:3; 10:29;  13:2; 13:11; 14:24; 15:9,18,28; 17:21.\n    <ul>\n      <li>Each king is evaluated by the standard of  apostasy: &#x201C;The sin of Jeroboam, son of Nebat.&#x201D;  Little more needs to be said about whether a king was faithful to the  Lord or not. The reader can easily grasp  the historical implications for Israel based on this assessment.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Summarize historical situation of the book</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>What  time does the book cover? (see chart) E.g.:  Genesis includes prehistory (1&#x2014;11); patriarchal period (12&#x2014;50)</li>\n  <li>Describe  the general <em>circumstances</em> facing  God&#x2019;s people?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Summarize the main characters and their  relationship to the main theme(s)</em></p>\n<p>Abraham  (12&#x2014;23); Isaac (24&#x2014;26); Jacob (27&#x2014;36); Joseph and his brothers (37&#x2014;50)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Structure (skeleton) of the individual narrative</strong></p>\n<p><em></em><em>Structure </em>concerns how the pieces of a narrative relate to each other. By closely noting the flow of the story and  the connection of each scene within the narrative, interpreters are able to  understand its purpose (main point) and how the main point is illustrated,  supported, or applied by the dialogue and flow of action. Structure is the<em> form</em> or shape of the text while content relates to the <em>substance</em> of the ideas contained within  it. </p>\n<p><em></em><em>Identify and chart <u>each</u> <u>scene</u> in the narrative. </em>Substantial portions of books may constitute a  narrative, a complete story (E.g.: Exodus 1&#x2014;19; Genesis 37&#x2014;50). Narratives may also be defined in narrower  terms&#x2014;the life of a patriarch, the reign of a king, and so forth. <em>A  more or less complete story defines a narrative: generally with a beginning, a  sequence of events or dialogue, and a conclusion. </em>Chart each scene in the story.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Setting</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Context</em></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\tBriefly  summarize <em>preceding</em> and <em>subsequent</em> narratives. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em></em><strong><em>Identify</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><u>Who</u>? Describe  each person in the scene, noting characteristics the   narrator  identifies&#x2014;where they are from, friend or foe, etc. The  more  we know about the characters of the narrative, the more vivid  will be the  dramatic effect of the story. Characters  offer cautionary  or  positive examples to the reader who is invited to identify with them.</p>\n<p><u>Where</u>? Location  can play an important role in understanding the poignancy  of a text or its  meaning. Why are the characters where  they are?</p>\n<p><u>When</u>? Identify  when the narrative takes place. What  could be generally   said about these times that would aid  understanding why this  particular  story matters? For example, narratives  from 1 and 2  Kings  relate to the reign of the kings of Israel and Judah. These  are  distressing times and times of blessing, often depending on the  spiritual condition  of the king. What God is accomplishing  through  the  narrative relates directly to this historical circumstance. </p>\n\n<p><em>Note:</em> changes in setting signal shifts in scene. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Purpose clues: what is the <u>main</u> <u>point</u> of the story?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Repetitions</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><em></em>Formulas:\n    <ul>\n      <li>&#x201C;Evil/good  in the sight of the Lord (2 Kings)</li>\n      <li>&#x201C;Is it  because there is no God in Israel&#x2026;&#x201D;

The word of the Lord  came to him, saying, 3 &#x201C;Go away from here and turn eastward, and hide yourself  by the brook Cherih, which is east of the Jordan. 4 &#x201C;It shall be that you will drink of the  brook, and I have commanded the ravens to provide for you there.&#x201D; 5 So he went  and did according to the word of the Lord, for he went and lived by the brook  Cherith, which is east of the Jordan. 6 The ravens brought him bread and meat  in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he would drink from the  brook. 7 It happened after a while that the brook dried up, because there was  no rain in the land. </strong><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>8 Then the  word of the Lord came to him, saying, 9 &#x201C;Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs  to Sidon, and stay there; behold, I have commanded a widow there to provide for  you.&#x201D; 10 So he arose and went to Zarephath, and when he came to the gate of the  city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks; and he called to her and  said, &#x201C;Please get me a little water in a jar, that I may drink.&#x201D; 11 As she was  going to get it, he called to her and said, &#x201C;Please bring me a piece of bread  in your hand.&#x201D; 12 But she said, &#x201C;As the Lord your God lives, I have no bread,  only a handful of flour in the bowl and a little oil in the jar; and behold, I am  gathering a few sticks that I may go in and prepare for me and my son, that we  may eat it and die.&#x201D; 13 Then Elijah said to her, &#x201C;Do not fear; go, do as you  have said, but make me a little bread cake from it first and bring it out to  me, and afterward you may make one for yourself and for your son. 14 &#x201C;For thus  says the Lord God of Israel, &#x2018;The bowl of flour shall not be exhausted, nor  shall the jar of oil be empty, until the day that the Lord sends rain on the  face of the earth.&#x2019;&#x201D; 15 So she went and did according to the word of Elijah,  and she and he and her household ate for many days. 16 The bowl of flour was  not exhausted nor did the jar of oil become empty, according to the word of the  Lord, which He spoke through Elijah. </strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong><strong>17 Now it  came about after these things that the son of the woman, the mistress of the  house, became sick; and his sickness was so severe that there was no breath  left in him. 18 So she said to Elijah, &#x201C;What do I have to do with you, O man of  God? You have come to me to bring my iniquity to remembrance and to put my son  to death!&#x201D; 19 He said to her, &#x201C;Give me your son.&#x201D; Then he took him from her  bossom and carried him up to the upper room where he was living, and laid him  on his own bed. 20 He called to the Lord and said, &#x201C;O Lord my God, have You  also brought calamity to the widow with whom I am staying, by causing her son  to die?&#x201D; 21 Then he stretched himself upon the child three times, and called to  the Lord and said, &#x201C;O Lord my God, I pray You, let this child&#x2019;s life return to  him.&#x201D; 22 The Lord heard the voice of Elijah, and the life of the child returned  to him and he revived. 23 Elijah took the child and brought him down from the  upper room into the house and gave him to his mother; and Elijah said, &#x201C;See,  your son is alive.&#x201D; 24 Then the woman said to Elijah, &#x201C;Now I know that you are  a man of God and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.&#x201D;</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Plot and dialogue</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Narration: Story teller&#x2019;s relationship to the  story.</em></p>\n<p>&#x201C;<strong>Point of view</strong>&#x201D;</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Space</em> and <em>tempo</em> of the <em>scene provide a sense of symmetry to the narrative</em>. It draws the reader&#x2019;s attention to what is  important. Note for instance in the  creation narrative of Genesis 1 that the creative days leading to the creation  of man move very quickly, but then the pace slows as the uniqueness of man is  carefully described: the crown of creation.  So interpreters need to pay close attention to what is being emphasized  through narrative slowing and events or dialogue expanding. </p>\n  <p>Editorial  insertions:  </p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Introduction  (Genesis 1:1) </p>\n    <p>Conclusion  or summary (Genesis 2:3)</p>\n    <p>Clarification/evaluations/explanations  (Genesis 6:6; 1 Sam. 21:6; Ex. 1:8)</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><u>Action and Dialogue</u></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>How does the plot move forward?</em> Usually  the narrative begins with a<em> circumstance </em>(perhaps  a problem) that unfolds through a sequence of scenes, bringing the story to a<em> climax or crisis,</em> and then <em>resolution</em>. </p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Genesis  6&#x2014;9 Flood narrative</p>\n    <p>Genesis  22 Abraham&#x2019;s sacrifice of Isaac</p>\n    <p>Genesis  32, 33 Jacob and Esau</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p>Note  the plot movement from scene to scene. This linear progression in the narrative  reflects the Old Testament&#x2019;s unique linear view of history. See for instance the critical contrast with  the Hindu epic, <em>Bhagavad-Gita</em> II:26&#x2014;III:5, where Krishna &#x201C;comforts&#x201D; Arjuna by reminding him of life&#x2019;s  unavoidable fate&#x2014;it&#x2019;s resignation, not resolution. </p>\n  <p>Note  how the narrator&#x2019;s description of events and dialogue shape the <em>character&#x2019;s development</em>. <em>Describe  what we&#x2019;re told of the inner life, motivations, relative virtue, spiritual  sensitivity, and relationship of the characters to the main point of the  narrative</em>. Is the reader to be draw  to or repulsed by the characters? How  have the key characters been changed through the narrative? (see Gen. 32,33).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jonah</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scene #1: 1:1,2</strong></p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"238\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>setting</strong><strong> </strong></p></td>\n    <td width=\"221\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>plot and dialogue</strong><strong> </strong></p></td>\n    <td width=\"221\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>purpose clues</strong><strong> </strong></p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"238\" valign=\"top\"><p><em>Context:</em></p>\n      \n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Jonah         is a complete narrative</strong>. </li>\n      </ul>\n      \n      <p><em>Identify:</em></p>\n      \n      <p>who&#x2014;

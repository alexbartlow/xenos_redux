In drawing out these theological points, it is helpful to  look for content related to three central areas: the use of the Old Testament  in the Gospels, the nature of the kingdom of God, and God&#x2019;s fatherhood.</p>\n<h3>The Use of the Old Testament in the Gospels</h3>\n<p>The Gospels contain many references to the Old Testament,  including direct quotes, references to Old Testament narratives, and  connections to Old Testament prophesy. When studying passages containing these  references, it&#x2019;s essential to first determine the meaning of the Old Testament  narrative or prophesy to which the Gospel account refers. From there, look at  the way the Gospel authors employ the Old Testament writings. This will give  you clues as to the meaning and truth being conveyed in the Gospel passage:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Use of the  Old Testament language and citations as colloquial expressions: Old  Testament expressions and imagery were a significant part of simple cultural  references used by people at the time. For example the imagery of a tree used  in Matthew 13:32 would have easily been recognized by the people of the time as  being a reference to God&#x2019;s provision. Such a reference didn&#x2019;t hold a deep  theological or prophetic meaning, but instead was just a simple cultural  expression, rooted in the Old Testament.</li>\n    <li>Allusions: Many times the Gospels indirectly use  Old Testament material to bring out the tone or nature of a particular  situation. For example, Jesus&#x2019; words in Mark 14:34 conjure up the language of  Psalm 42 &amp; 43, thus giving us a sense of the emotion and meaning of his  words.  </li>\n  <li>Application  or accommodation of an Old Testament principle:<em> </em>Sometimes an Old Testament  principle is applied in the New Testament in a fresh way, in a fresh context  that takes it a step beyond its original use but is still in keeping with its  original principle. For example when Jesus talks to the unbelieving crowd in  Matthew 15:5ff, he is not saying that they are somehow completing a  prophesy&#x2014;instead he is noting how they are like the people Isaiah describes in  the Old Testament passage cited. </li>\n  <li>The Old  Testament is cited as a way of capturing an opponent&#x2019;s point of view. See  Jesus&#x2019; use of the Old Testament in Matthew 5:21-22; 27-28; 31-32; 33-34; 38-39;  and 43-44. </li>\n  <li>Direct Old  Testament prophesy fulfillment: Many times the Old Testament is referenced  to show that the New Testament&#x2014;specifically Jesus&#x2014;fulfills the explicit intended meaning of an Old  Testament author. For example, in Luke  4:18-21, Jesus claims that he is fulfilling the Messianic prophesy given in  Isaiah 61:1-2. See also Matthew 8:16-17 and Luke 22:37 (Is. 53), Matthew  1:22-23 (Is. 7:14), and Acts 2:16-21 (Joel 2:28-32). </li>\n  <li>New  Testament fulfillment of Old Testament passages that are not explicitly tied to an Old Testament  passage, but which implicitly carry  the meaning found in the New Testament. Under this category, Old Testament  prophesies, themes, and motifs find their completion&#x2014;they are brought to fullness&#x2014;not in an event, but in the  person of Jesus. See Matthew 5:17, Luke 18:31-33, and Luke 24:44. See also John  4, where Jesus offers himself as &#x201C;living water,&#x201D; water being a theme in the Old  Testament of God&#x2019;s provision. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The  Nature of the Kingdom of God</h3>\nThe  concept of the <em>kingdom of God</em> is  woven throughout the Gospel accounts, frequently referenced by Jesus. \n<ul>\n  <li>His  use of the term is rooted in Old Testament teachings and concepts: </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li>God is a king over his people: See Exodus 15:18, Numbers 23:21, and Isaiah 43:15.  See also passages referencing the &#x201C;Day of the Lord&#x201D; (e.g. Joel 2-3), which is  seen as God breaking in on history to establish His rule. </li>\n    <li>God is the earth&#x2019;s  king: Portrayed as both a current king (2 Kings 19:15, Isa. 6:5, Jer. 46:18) and a future king (Isa. 24:23, 33:22, 52:7, Zeph. 3:15, Zech. 14:9)</li>\n    <li>God&#x2019;s rule  is David&#x2019;s rule: 1 Chron. 28:5; 2 Chron. 9:8; 13:8; Ezek. 34:23,24)</li>\n  </ul>\n  <li>Jewish people of Jesus&#x2019; time had an apocalyptic  outlook of the kingdom of God, expecting a radical, overpowering, in-breaking of God on earth. They regarded the &#x201C;present&#x201D; age as being  evil, and anticipated a future time of blessing for God&#x2019;s people and judgment  for His enemies. There was a sense of being a &#x201C;wall&#x201D; between these two  times&#x2014;the present time belonging to Satan and the future time belonging to God.  This perspective led to moral and ethical passivity, with a focus on individual  efforts to fulfill the law.</li>\n  <li>In contrast, Jesus taught that there was a very  real fulfillment of the <em>kingdom of God</em> at the present time, though it had not yet been brought to full consummation.  He was ushering in a messianic rule, and while not apparent in a geo-political  sense, it was a conquering of the age of evil nonetheless. Jesus offered that  there were &#x201C;kingdom blessings&#x201D; available to those who put themselves under the  authority of the messianic rule:</li>\n  <ul>\n    <li>People  were invited to enter into the kingdom: Matthew 25: 34, 46</li>\n    <li>The kingdom  is a gift (Luke 12:32) of salvation (Mark 10:17-30) to be sought and received  (Mt. 7:7, 13:44-46, 6:33), even to outsiders (Mt. 8:11-13). </li>\n    <li>The kingdom included eternal life (Mt. 25:46, Mark 9:43) and the &#x201C;joy of the Lord&#x201D; (Mt.  25:21, 23) </li>\n    <li>The kingdom offered resurrection at the end of the age  (Luke 20:34-36) </li>\n    <li>Evils are purged in the kingdom (Mt. 25:34,46) </li>\n    <li>By entering into the kingdom, fellowship with God is  restored (Mt. 22:1-14; 25:1-12) </li>\n    <li>The kingdom includes unexpected reversals&#x2014;those who  would seem to be in it are not, and those who would seem to be out are in (Matthew  5:1&#x2014;12) </li>\n    <li>These &#x201C;reversals&#x201D; are also seen in Jesus&#x2019; teachings on  the nature of discipleship (Mark 8:35; 10:43-45) </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li>The <em>kingdom of God</em> is portrayed as a <em>mystery</em> that is seen easily and given  freely to those who have a willing heart, but is kept hidden from those who are  not humble before God (Matthew 13:10-17) </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Fatherhood of God</h3>\nIn the Gospels, <em>father</em> is the most common way Jesus  refers to God. It is used over 100 times in John and 65 times in the other  Gospels. Note its use in Matthew 5-7, and the implications for relating to God  and being His disciple:\n<ul>\n  <li>Your Father knows  you fully (therefore trust in Him)&#x2014;Matthew 6:26 &amp; 6:32</li>\n  <li>Your Father  accepts you unconditionally (therefore give others unconditional love)&#x2014;Matthew  5:44-45 &amp; 6:14</li>\n  <li>Your Father fully  cares for you and delights in you (therefore relate to Him in a way that  reflects His great love and care for you)&#x2014;Matthew 6:8 &amp; 7:11</li>\n</ul>\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Identifying Theology in the Gospels","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/hermeneutics/Gospel/IdentifyingTheologyintheGospels.htm"}

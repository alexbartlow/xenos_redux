Important distinctions about the Gospels that  will aid your understanding of them:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The gospel accounts are selective, purposeful  accounts of the life of Jesus. Each Gospel has a thesis the author is  defending to a particular audience. For Luke and John, the theses are explicitly  spelled out (see John 20:30-31 and Luke 1:1-4). While Matthew and Mark have no  such clear statement, their core purposes can be inferred from the events and  teachings they select, and from the editorial and structural perspective the  author provides.</li>\n  <li>The gospel accounts are meant to persuade and  equip the reader. They are not disinterested, neutral presentations of the  facts, but instead are evangelical treatises. Through their course they develop  arguments, based on evidence supporting their claims. For example, Matthew extensively uses the Old Testament as  proof of the validity of Jesus&#x2019; teachings while Luke emphasizes historical accuracy and Jesus&#x2019;  innocence by Roman legal standards. </li>\n  <li>The Gospels provided the early church with  authoritative teaching against the backdrop of emerging heresy and other  challenges faced by the early Christian church. Note the teachings on the dangers and rewards of  discipleship in Mark and the  emphasis on Christology in John.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Understanding How Jesus is Portrayed in  the Gospels</h3>\n<p><strong>Jesus as Rabbi: </strong>Clearly  the Gospel authors and many who heard Jesus speak regarded him as a teacher&#x2014;a rabbi&#x2014;a term that in used 40 times in  the Gospels (see Mt. 23:8 &amp; 10:24-25). With that in mind, it&#x2019;s helpful to  be aware of common rabbinical figures of speech and how they were used to  convey meaning to an audience at the time. When using one of these forms,  typically a single general point is  made, and the context is crucial for seeing the point. </p>\n<table width=\"849\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"8\">\n  <tr valign=\"top\">\n    <td width=\"192\" valign=\"top\"></td>\n    <td width=\"313\" valign=\"top\"></td>\n    <td width=\"280\" valign=\"top\"></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr valign=\"top\">\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Overstatement/hyperbole</p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Exaggeration to make a point</p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Luke 14:26 &amp;Mt. 5:29-30</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr valign=\"top\">\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Pun</p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Play on words </p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Mt. 23:23-24 (salma vs. samla) or Jn. 3:8 (spirit and wind)</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr valign=\"top\">\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Simile</p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Comparison using <em>like</em> or <em>as</em></p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Mt. 10:16 &amp; 12:40</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr valign=\"top\">\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Metaphor</p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Comparison not using like, as</p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Mark 8:15</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr valign=\"top\">\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Proverb</p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Wise saying, aphorism</p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Mt. 6:21 &amp; 26:52</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr valign=\"top\">\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Riddle</p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Puzzling story with a deeper    meaning</p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Mark 14:58 &amp; Mt. 11:12</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr valign=\"top\">\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Paradox</p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Statement that seems    contradictory, but isn&#x2019;t</p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Mt. 5:1ff &amp; 16:25</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr valign=\"top\">\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>A fortiori</p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>&#x201C;how much more&#x2026; &#x201C;</p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Mt. 7:9-11 &amp; 10:25</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr valign=\"top\">\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Irony/sarcasm</p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Unexpected result</p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Mt. 16:2-3 &amp; Luke 16:20</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr valign=\"top\">\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Question</p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>&#x201C;Who do you say that I am?&#x201D; or &#x201C;Can a man have two masters?&#x201D;</p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Mark 8:27-32; 3:1-4; 9:50</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr valign=\"top\">\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Poetic parallelism</p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Repetition used to advance,    contrast thought of first line</p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Mt. 7:7-8; Mark 9:37; Luke 16:10</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr valign=\"top\">\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Parable</p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Extended metaphor with single    meaning, or allegory </p></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\"><p>Mt. 13 &amp; Luke 15:4-10 </p></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Jesus as a Prophet</strong>:   In addition to being regarded as a teacher, Jesus also is recognized throughout Gospel accounts as a prophet. See Mark 5:15; 8:28; 14:65;  Luke 7:16; Mt. 21:11, 46. Notice how he is shown as one who shared the  characteristics of the Old Testament prophets:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>He performed prophetic signs and miracles. See  Luke 17:16 &amp; John 3:2</li>\n  <li>His message was inspired by the Holy Spirit. See  Mt. 12:18 &amp; Luke 4:16-30</li>\n  <li>He claimed a divine calling and message. See Luke 4:18, 10:21, &amp; Mt. 5:21</li>\n  <li>As with Old Testament prophets, he was rejected.  See Luke 13:33-34</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Jesus as a Unique  Authority</strong>:   The Gospels attest to Jesus&#x2019; unique authority as a teacher  and prophet:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>His authority above the teachings of others,  through his use of the phrase, &#x201C;You have heard...but I say...&#x201D; See Mt. 5:21-22, 27-28, 31-32, 33-34, 38-39,  and 43-44. See also Mt. 7:28-29.</li>\n  <li>The testimony of John the Baptist&#x2014;see John  3:31-36</li>\n  <li>Jesus&#x2019; use of &#x201C;I AM&#x201D; statements, indicating his  claim to deity. See John 8 &amp; 10.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Jesus&#x2019; use of  &#x201C;Parabolic Acts&#x201D; as Teaching Devices</strong>: Many times the Gospels show Jesus making a point&#x2014;teaching,  in a sense&#x2014;through an action instead of through a spoken teaching. Many times  Jesus performed a miraculous sign not only as a simple act of mercy, but also  to make a theological point about the nature of God, man, and God&#x2019;s plan of  salvation. He often employed actions that were symbolic of these theological  points.  </p>\n<p>As you work to understand these deeper points, remember  that Jesus&#x2019; actions were taken against the backdrop of Judaism of that time. He  was a controversialist and his teachings were designed to inflame opposition to  God and dramatically demonstrate God&#x2019;s mercy.  With that in mind, notice where, when, and for whom the action in a  particular passage is performed. Ask yourself, &#x201C;What is the significance of  this demonstration, in this particular context, to Jesus&#x2019; original audience?&#x201D;</p>\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Gospels Worksheet Intro","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/hermeneutics/Gospel/GospelsWorksheetIntro.htm"}

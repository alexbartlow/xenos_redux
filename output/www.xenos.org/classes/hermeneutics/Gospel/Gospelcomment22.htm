Where?  When?</li>\n      <li>Note  the irony&#x2014;Jesus leaves Israel after engaging Jerusalem&#x2019;s religious elite over  the nature of ritual cleanness, to pagan land.  The Canaanite woman, unlike either the disciples or the religious  authorities, recognizes Jesus&#x2019; true identity as &#x201C;Son of David&#x201D; (see also 9:27;  12:23&#x2014;two prior uses of &#x201C;Son of David&#x201D;, both on lips of the unclean).</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li> Second  scene: exchange with disciples (15:23-24)&#x2014;establishes the significance of the  deliverance.\n    <ul>\n      <li>Jesus&#x2019;  silence is met by the disciples&#x2019; request to send her away.</li>\n      <li>Jesus&#x2019;  response is significant: &#x201C;I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.&#x201D;\n        <ul>\n          <li>The Son  of David is Israel&#x2019;s messiah in a unique way (see Jn. 4:22&#x2014;26). But at the same  time, Jesus has healed gentiles (8:5&#x2014;13). </li>\n          <li>These  points contribute to the dramatic exchange between the woman and Jesus.</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Third  scene: exchange with the woman (15:25-28)&#x2014;the sufficiency of faith in God&#x2019;s  mercy.\n    <ul>\n      <li>To the  woman&#x2019;s repeated plea Jesus says, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not good to throw the children&#x2019;s bread  to the dogs.&#x201D; I.e.&#x2014;blessings go to Israel, not gentiles.</li>\n      <li>Woman  does not contradict Jesus, but extends the saying to include the needs of her  daughter&#x2014;a true act of reverent faith.</li>\n      <li>Jesus,  seeing her faith, grants her the request.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Structure summary</strong>: Context:  challenge of internal vs. external cleanliness </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Supporting  Point #1: Ironic identification by &#x201C;unclean&#x201D; woman that Jesus is &#x201C;Son of David&#x201D;\n  </li>\n  <li>Supporting  Point #2: Messiah&#x2019;s mission centers on the lost of  Israel\n  </li>\n  <li>Supporting  Point #3: Woman pleas for inclusion in blessings of God to Israel </li>\n  <li>  Main  Point: God honors the greatness of woman&#x2019;s faith (both persistence and  content)&#x2014;she is a strong antithesis to the rabbis&#x2019; tradition-based religion  centering on purity and defilement \n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Matthew 15:1-20 </h4>\n<p><strong>Context</strong>: Why is this passage  here? </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Preceding  passage: walking on the water&#x2014;a challenge to Peter&#x2019;s faith (compare with 9:27  where the emphasis is on Jesus&#x2019; unique authority)\n  </li>\n  <li>Following  passage: delivering the Syrophoenician woman&#x2019;s  daughter and other healings&#x2014;here is a woman who is certainly unclean\n    Teaching  is directed first to the Pharisees themselves (denunciation); then to the  multitude; finally, to the disciples.

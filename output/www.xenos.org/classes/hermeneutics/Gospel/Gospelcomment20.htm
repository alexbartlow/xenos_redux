Yet, this fulfillment has much irony which was almost certainly lost on  the original participants in this event.  Jesus directly fulfills Zechariah 9:9, anticipating the messiah coming  as king, bringing salvation to Jerusalem, and mounted humbly on a colt. Laying branches before the messiah symbolically  connects the hope of messiah with the &#x201C;Branch of David&#x201D; (Jer. 23:5; Is.  11:1,2,10; Zech. 3:8-10). The crowd  cites Psalm 118:25, 26. &#x201C;Hosanna&#x201D; means  &#x201C;Lord save us&#x201D; (Ps. 118:25), followed by &#x201C;Blessed is the one who comes in the  name of the Lord.&#x201D; The whole text of Ps.  118:22-28 seems uniquely relevant and prophetic. It is a hymn sung at one of the key festivals  of the Jews, probably Passover&#x2014;which in context clearly has symbolic  significance. So Jesus, the &#x201C;rejected  cornerstone&#x201D; is to be the sacrifice bound to the altar. </p>\n<h3>Matthew 21:12-17  Cleansing the Temple</h3>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"319\" valign=\"top\"><p>Context:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Triumphal    entry, fulfilling scripture; Jesus accepts public acknowledgement that he is    the messiah</li>\n        <li>Followed by    the symbolic cursing of the fig tree</li>\n        <li>His authority    will be challenged based, in part, on this event (21:23ff.)</li>\n    </ul></td>\n    <td width=\"342\" valign=\"top\"><p>Setting:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>In Jerusalem    at the temple</li>\n        <li>Blind and    lame; priests and scribes; children</li>\n    </ul></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"319\" valign=\"top\"><p>Dialogue/Story Development</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Entering the    temple, Jesus throws out moneychangers</li>\n        <li>Prophetic    denunciation of the hypocrisy at the temple</li>\n        <li>Blind and    lame at the temple healed</li>\n        <li>Crisis: Priests become indignant with    Jesus&#x2019; healings and the children recognition that Jesus is the Son of David</li>\n        <li>Resolution:    Accommodation of scripture to denounce the priests</li>\n        <li>Jesus    retreats to Bethany for the night</li>\n      </ul>\n    </td>\n    <td width=\"342\" valign=\"top\"><p>Character Development</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Note the    sharp contrasts between the needy and innocent, and the priests</li>\n        <li>Rather than    &#x201C;anointing the holy place,&#x201D; Jesus creates a scandal by in essence denouncing    it.</li>\n    </ul></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n<p>Main point:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Cleansing the  temple for its true purpose, as a confrontation with the religious officials  that misrepresent its purpose</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Supporting points:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Cleansing the  temple is in keeping with the tradition of prophetic denunciation such as in  Isaiah&#x2019;s day (v.13 cf. Jeremiah 7:11)</li>\n  <li>More signs from  Jesus in healing the blind and lame (v.14)</li>\n  <li>Child&#x2019;s faith  again affirmed (v.15,16, cf. Psalm 8:2)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Theology:</p>\n<p>When the messiah comes, he is to anoint the temple  (Dan. 9:24 and related passages). But in  this scene, Jesus does not consecrate the temple, but confronts it for its  hypocrisy. This event is another  instance of confronting the religious who are far from the kingdom. The discussion in vs. 23-27 clearly draw  importance on the issue of authority&#x2014;an issue that pervades Jesus&#x2019;  ministry. The children&#x2019;s faith and the  signs performed, again, demonstrate the truth of Jesus&#x2019; witness and the emptiness  of Jewish formalistic religion.</p>\n<h3> <p>Matthew 21:23-27  Cursing the Fig Tree</p></h3>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"319\" valign=\"top\"><p>Context:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>After    cleansing the temple (21:12-17)</li>\n        <li>Jesus&#x2019;    authority to be challenged (21:23-27)</li>\n      </ul>\n    </td>\n    <td width=\"342\" valign=\"top\"><p>Setting:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>On the return    to Jerusalem the next morning</li>\n        <li>Jesus is with    his disciples</li>\n    </ul></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"319\" valign=\"top\"><p>Dialogue/Story Development</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Crisis: Jesus finds no fruit on the fig    tree</li>\n        <li>Tree is    cursed, no longer to bear fruit</li>\n        <li>Disciples    marvel, &#x201C;How did the tree wither at once?&#x201D;</li>\n        <li>Jesus    responds using figures of speech</li>\n        <li>Resolution: What you    ask in prayer, believing, you will receive</li>\n      </ul>\n    </td>\n    <td width=\"342\" valign=\"top\"><p>Character Development</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Jesus&#x2019;    symbolic act of cursing the fig tree seems a fitting continuation of his    cleansing the temple</li>\n        <li>Disciples    focus on the miraculous nature of the event rather than its symbolic    importance</li>\n    </ul></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n<p>Main point:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Jesus&#x2019;  disciples called to a true, effective faith (v.22)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Supporting points:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Contrast of  Israel&#x2019;s failed faith&#x2014;the symbolic imagery of the fig tree</li>\n  <li>Israel (the fig  tree) is condemned to fruitlessness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Theology:</p>\n<p>Fig tree as Israel (in context of previous scene; also Hosea 9:10;  Jeremiah 8:13 use the same imagery in relation to Israel, and the latter, in  relation to God&#x2019;s judgment of the nation).  Israel was to bear the fruit of being God&#x2019;s unique covenant people. They failed to obey God&#x2019;s law and did not  live as a witness of God to the watching world.  So Jesus pronounces judgment on Israel and shifts his attention to his  disciples, who will carry on the work of the kingdom. Effect of believing  prayer rooted in true belief, not ritual. </p>\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Gospel comment 20","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/hermeneutics/Gospel/Gospelcomment20.htm"}

In 1 Corinthians 1:18, Paul  admits these arguments may seem foolish to people of the time, but they are  based on God&#x2019;s revelation in history. </p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s helpful to understand the cultural point of view in  order to understand the logic and arguments being put forth by the authors. Often  the epistle authors write with three major viewpoints in mind:</p>\n<p>1. Greek  Dualism</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This philosophy taught that reality is divided into the  spiritual and physical. Humans are spirits encased&#x2014;or enslaved&#x2014;in a physical  body. The authors of the epistles advanced both doctrinal and  practical arguments against dualism:</p>\n  <p><em>Doctrinal</em> arguments against dualism:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Dualism       conflicts with several attributes of Jesus including his full humanity (1 John       1:1, 4:1-2 &amp; John 1:14), full deity (Col. 2:9 &amp; Heb. 1:3), and the       fact that he experienced bodily resurrection from the dead (1 Cor.       15:1-17).</li>\n    <li>Dualism       conflicts with the doctrine of the bodily resurrection of Christians (1       Cor. 15:12, 18, 19, 50-58)</li>\n    <li>Dualism       conflicts with the singular authority of Christ to forgive sins and rule       creation since forgiveness was based on a blood-shedding atoning sacrifice,       and Jesus&#x2019; right to rule is based on his sacrifice (Col. 1:15-20).</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Practical</em> arguments against dualism:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>The philosophy       of dualism often led to pervasive <em>license</em> within the culture. If humans were spirits       trapped within a body, and the physical world was separated from the       spiritual world, then the <em>physical</em> could be indulged without it harming the <em>spiritual</em>. Paul uses Christian doctrine to argue against this       in 1 Corinthians 5:1-13 and 6:12-20.</li>\n    <li>Conversely, the       philosophy of dualism also led to <em>asceticism</em>.       If the physical realm trapped and imprisoned the spiritual, then one might       be able to escape this prison by radical self-denial. See Paul&#x2019;s argument       against this in Colossians 2:20-23.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>2. Spiritual  Illumination by Mystical Experience\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Roman culture embraced mystery religions from  Asia, offering &#x201C;secret&#x201D; knowledge and mystical awareness&#x2014;revelation&#x2014;to those  willing to follow its often-bombastic rituals. In contrast, Christianity was  emerging with the offer of revelation through the observance and study of God&#x2019;s  movement in history and His communication of truth.\n  </p>\n  <p><em>Doctrinal</em> arguments against mystical revelation advanced by epistle authors:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>God offers       objective revelation, in the face of the tendency toward &#x201C;gnosis&#x201D; and       false teachings (1 Tim. 6:20-21, Col. 2:8-9, 2 Cor. 10:3-5)</li>\n    <li>Spiritual       revelation is based on historic fact (1 Cor. 15:1-10; see also Luke 1:1-4)</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Practical</em> arguments against mystical revelation advanced by epistle authors:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Group gatherings       were to be orderly, in contrast with the chaotic rituals of the mystics (1       Cor. 11:20-22; 14:6-19)</li>\n    <li>They were to       stress faithfulness to the Word of God above experience. (Rom. 12:1-2)</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>3. Cyclical  View of History\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Roman culture regarded man&#x2019;s existence as  being in an endless cycle, with both history and nature on an endless and  unchanging loop. There was no sense of ultimate purpose or destiny to human  history, and no sense of progression in history. This stands against the  epistle&#x2019;s argument for the importance of God&#x2019;s revelation of salvation over  time (1 Thes. 4:13-5:11), and the hope that Christians can derive from knowing  there is a beginning (Gen. 1:1), a meaningful sequence of events, and a final  culmination.\n  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Christian  Ethics in the Context of Greco-Roman Culture</strong></p>\n<p>The Christian world view stood in stark contrast  with the popular views of basic social structures of the time, including  slavery, religion, family, and government.  As such, Christianity became a driving force of social transformation in  these arenas. This heart of this ethos is summed up in Galatians 3:28 and  Colossians 3:11. For more on this topic,  see John Howard Yoder&#x2019;s book <em>The Politics of Jesus</em>.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Slavery: Slavery was widespread in the Greco-Roman culture,  with slaves outnumbering the free. Though the culture promoted a sharp divide  between slaves and the rest of society, the Christian was to see every person  as a brother and an equal. Slavery is addressed throughout the epistles: slave status in       the church (Philemon 8-21); freedom is to be       valued (1 Cor. 7:20-24); relationship and       attitude between slave and master (Eph. 6:5-9); and the condemnation of       slavery (1 Tim 1:10&#x2014;cf. Ex 21:16; Philemon 8).</li>\n  <li>Jews and Gentiles: The epistle authors also challenged the divide  between the Jews and Gentiles of the time, calling on them to unite as  Christians and regard each other as brothers (Gal. 3:28). They were to  practically care for each others&#x2019; needs (Rom. 12:5; 1 Cor. 16:3; 2 Cor. 8-9). They were also given instructions on cultural  and religious practices, in light of their new status as Christians, including  the status of circumcision (Gal. 1:6-9; 5:2-4) and eating meat sacrificed to  idols (1 Cor. 8:1-13). The authors were helping the new Christians understand  what practices were controlled by doctrine and what were controlled by cultural  norms. </li>\n  <li>Family: Cultural practices dictated a much higher status  for men over women, which played out in family life at the time. Women and  children were to be subservient. The new Christian ethics of equality and community  challenged this, calling for a mutual submission and respect. Ephesians 5:21-33  places the primary burden of responsibility in the family on the man to love  and care for his wife and children. </li>\n  <li>Government: Paul promoted an ethic of subordination and respect  for the government, even when the government seemed unreasonable (1 Tim. 2:1-3;  Rom. 12:14-13:7).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>IVP Bible Background Commentary on the New Testament</em> by Craig Keener is a great verse-by-verse resouce on how the text is rooted in Jewish and Roman cultural practices and beliefs.</p>\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Cultural Context of the Epistles","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/hermeneutics/Epistles/CulturalContextoftheEpistles.htm"}

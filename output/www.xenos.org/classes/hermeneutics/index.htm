We don&#x2019;t have to imagine or surmise what God is like or  what He asks of us. Instead we can have confidence in the truth that God  Himself has made known to us, because it comes directly from Him.</p>\n<p>The Bible is one of God&#x2019;s primary vehicles of revealing  Himself. Through it He will show us <em>statements  of fact</em> (See Luke 1:1-4), <em>wisdom</em> (See Heb. 5:14, 1 Cor. 2:14, Ps. 1, 119), and even <em>personal insight</em>&#x2014;God speaking to us and our situation through the  Holy Spirit (Heb. 4:12; Deut. 8:3; 1 Pet. 2:2; Ps. 119:105, 169; 2 Tim. 3:16). Since the Bible represents God&#x2019;s communication  to us, we have a sacred responsibility to guard it as a precious treasure (1  Tim. 6:20; 2 Tim 1:14). We are to accurately interpret and teach it (2 Tim.  2:15), protect it against those  who distort its meaning (1 Tim. 6:20- 21; 2 Tim. 1:13-14), and regularly  use it to encourage other members of the Body of Christ (Col. 3:16; Eph. 5:19;  2 Tim. 4:1-4).</p>\n        <table width=\"581\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n          <tr valign=\"top\">\n            <td width=\"559\" valign=\"top\"> <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/personal/jim.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Jim Leffel</a> explains<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/hermeneutics/Intro/Intro-part2.mp3\" title=\"The Inductive Method of Bible Study\" class=\"popup audio\"> the inductive method</a><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/hermeneutics/graphics/audio.png\" width=\"16\" alt=\"audio\">, an approach to studying the Bible that aims to get at the Biblical author's original intended meaning.

This can  be difficult because language can be ambiguous, but a student of Scripture is  under obligation to work toward an accurate (though perhaps not exhaustive)  understanding of the author&#x2019;s original intent.</p>\n        <p>Biblical interpretation is a skill that you can develop with  practice over time. Just as with learning a musical instrument or a new sport,  you may feel clumsy or ill-equipped at first. But with sound technique and  practice, you&#x2019;ll become more proficient and capable. The reward of such effort  is being able to see deeply into the mind of God, and fall more and more under  His loving leadership.</p>\n        <p>The <em>inductive method</em> of Bible study offers a practical process for accurate interpretation. This  method uses details of the text to arrive at the author&#x2019;s intended meaning.  It&#x2019;s an approach used widely in both everyday problem solving and rigorous  academic study, relying on common sense to give explanation for the observed  data. The inductive method is in contrast with topical study&#x2014;looking for  answers to a particular doctrinal question&#x2014;and with devotional study&#x2014;looking at  scripture for truth that speaks to current needs or interests.</p>\n        <p>The inductive method is rooted in two principles:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Scripture  interprets scripture: The inductive approach looks to draw meaning from the  text itself, rather than imposing meaning upon it. It relies on information  gleaned from text. A careful student of the Bible will find a wealth of such  information, with repeated themes, terms, and direct quotes of other scripture  providing a commentary of sorts within the Bible itself. Such information  includes:</li>\n          <ul>\n            <li>Technical terms:&#xA0; Words used by numerous biblical authors to  convey the same idea or a growing theme in the scripture (e.g. &#x201C;branch,&#x201D; &#x201C;Son,&#x201D;  &#x201C;servant,&#x201D; &#x201C;Day of the Lord,&#x201D; &#x201C;Christ,&#x201D; &#x201C;kingdom,&#x201D; &#x201C;temple,&#x201D; and &#x201C;grace&#x201D;).</li>\n            <li>Event repetition<em>.</em>&#xA0; Reference to key events, especially in  Israel&#x2019;s history, that show a continuity and pattern of meaning over time (e.g.  Exodus, creation, and wilderness wandering).&#xA0;  This is called <em>motif</em>&#x2014;the meaning of the present or future is  defined in terms of a past event.</li>\n            <li><em>Direct quotes or allusions.</em>&#xA0; Almost every biblical writer quotes or  alludes to other biblical texts.&#xA0; Careful  analysis will show how a later author  understood earlier texts, thus shedding light on both the scripture cited and  the passage in which the citation occurs.&#xA0; </li>\n            <li>Promises and covenants.&#xA0; No other point of repetition demonstrates the  unity of the Bible more explicitly than promises and covenants.&#xA0; Key promises God makes are cited or alluded  to in every book of the Bible.</li>\n          </ul>\n        </ul>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Your interpretation is held up to three standards of proof&#x2014;sometimes  called the &#x201C;grammatical historical method&#x201D;&#x2014;which will either give you  confidence or skepticism about your take on a passage. </li>\n          <ul>\n            <li>Adequacy<em>:</em>&#xA0; Is your interpretation complete? Does it explain  all of the details of the text? Are all subordinate points meaningfully related  to the main point?</li>\n            <li>Consistency.  &#xA0;Does your interpretation agree with  external facts? Has the interpretation effectively considered current cultural  customs?&#xA0; Is the interpretation consistent  with historical events to which the text refers?&#xA0; What does the text state or imply about  nature?</li>\n            <li>Coherence.  Given the context and the rest of Scripture, does your interpretation make  sense?&#xA0; Does it harmonize with other  related scriptures?&#xA0; Does it include an  appropriate understanding of literary context and genre, word meaning, and  sentence structure?&#xA0; What is the basic  argument of the text? </li>\n          </ul>\n        </ul>\n        \n        <p>Inductive  study worksheets for four major genres of Scripture are available at the tabs at the top of page and here: <a class=\"openTab\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/hermeneutics/tab-2\">Old Testament</a>, <a class=\"openTab\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/hermeneutics/tab-3\">prophets</a>, <a class=\"openTab\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/hermeneutics/tab-4\">Gospels</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/hermeneutics/tab-5\" class=\"openTab style1\">epistles</a>.\n        \n        </p>\n        \n\n          </div>\n          \n            \n \n          </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"A Practical Guide to Hermeneutics","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/hermeneutics/index.htm"}

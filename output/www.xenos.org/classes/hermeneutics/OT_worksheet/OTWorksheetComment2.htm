They provide an outline or  overview of the events.

Links show that  these markers are not random ways that God works in human history, but are  instead \"linked\" together to form God's overall plan of salvation for  mankind. E.g.: God tells Joshua that He will be with him just as He was with  Moses (the Exodus <em>marker</em>).

Does that relate  to the meaning of the narrative? As you consider this narrative in relation to the rest of the Old Testament (and New Testament) how does it add to the Biblical teaching of God, humanity, and salvation? Are there terms or words that are part of a broader vocabulary relating to theology? For instance, does the narrative relate God's promises to Israel?

Included in the  works of narrative are the books of Genesis through Esther as well as major  portions of the prophetic books. Proper interpretation and application of Old Testament  narrative is built on the principle that such scripture is historical,  theological and literary in nature.</p>\n<p><strong>Old  Testament Narrative as History:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>In contrast with a nationalistic myth, Old  Testament narrative is a truthful recording of history, with the goal of  revealing and glorifying God. This principle is supported for several reasons: \n    <ul>\n      <li>These narratives are cited in both the Old and New  Testament as being history</li>\n      <li>Requiring archaeological confirmation of an Old  Testament event in order to consider it historic is not a standard applied to  other historic accounts.</li>\n      <li>Old Testament narratives employ a literary style  that is distinctly different from the mythology written by other cultures of  this time</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>In contrast with the non-existent animistic  deities worshipped by people the Old Testament times, one of the key goals of  Old Testament narrative is to demonstrate the God of Israel as an actual God,  existing and moving in history (See I Kings 18; Isaiah 40:18-24; 46:1-11.)</li>\n  <li>In contrast with other ancient cultures&#x2019;  concepts of time&#x2014;that time is just an endless turning of season to season&#x2014;the  view of Old Testament narratives is that time is <em>linear</em> and <em>history progresses through a meaningful and  coherent drama toward an end</em>. Without this notion of linear time, concepts  like &#x201C;progress&#x201D; or &#x201C;meaning&#x201D; or &#x201C;purpose&#x201D; are irrational.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Old Testament Narrative as Theology</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Old Testament narratives are not just stories. They are historic accounts deliberately told to demonstrate God's faithfulness to His promises and His sovereignty over human history.</li>\n  <li>Old Testament narratives are inter-related,  progressing accounts of God&#x2019;s purpose for history and how He intends to  accomplish it. As the narratives tell <em>what</em> happened (the context for God&#x2019;s revelation), they also indicate <em>why</em> it matters (the purpose of history).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Old  Testament Narrative as Literature</strong></p>\n<p>The  theology of a given narrative provides the literary center of the work&#x2014;its main  point. Narrative accounts are selective and purposeful&#x2014;events and characters  are to be understood in relation to the main theological point of the  narrative. A proper understanding of the main point depends on an understanding  of the narrative&#x2019;s place in the rest of Scripture, much as a play&#x2019;s different  acts should be understood in the context of the rest of the play. </p>\n<p>Three  important devices are used in Old Testament narratives to show God  progressively revealing Himself and His plan of salvation through the course of  time. Understanding these devices and  looking for them within Old Testament narratives will greatly enhance your  ability to see the main point and properly apply it.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Markers: Often  the main point of an Old Testament narrative&#x2014;its meaning&#x2014;can be found in key  theological statements called <em>markers</em>.  These are the primary points God is communicating or the primary ways he is  working&#x2014;they &#x201C;mark&#x201D; out eras of <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/hermeneutics/OT_worksheet/OT_worksheet/OTworksheetcomment3new.htm\" title=\"Old Testament Historic Eras\" class=\"popup sticky\">Old Testament history</a>. A proper understanding  of a given narrative will depend on an understanding of what <em>marker</em> God is working through.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Markers  include:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Blessings:  &#x201C;Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth&#x201D; Genesis 1:28</li>\n    <li>Covenants: the Law of Moses (Exodus 20ff) and  the New Covenant (Jeremiah 31)</li>\n    <li>Promises: unconditional statements of God&#x2019;s  intent. God&#x2019;s promises to Abraham and David serve as the literary center of  meaning for many Old Testament narratives:\n      <ul>\n        <li> The Abrahamic promise serves as the center of  the narrative from Genesis through Joshua.  It starts with God&#x2019;s blessing on Abraham, continues with the forming of  a people (Gen. 15-Ex. 19) and the ruling of a people (Ex. 20-40, Leviticus,  &amp; Deuteronomy), and the inheriting of the land (Joshua).</li>\n        <li>The Davidic promise serves as the center of the  narrative from Judges through 2 Chronicles. It covers the preparation for the  monarchy (Judges, Ruth, 1 Samuel), God&#x2019;s blessing on David (2 Samuel 7-24/1  Chron. 17-29), God&#x2019;s faithfulness to Solomon (1 Kings 1-11/2 Chron. 1-9) and  God&#x2019;s faithfulness to David&#x2019;s line (1 Kings 12-2 Kings 25/2 Chron. 10-36)</li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n  <li>    Links:\n    \n    Along  with the <em>markers</em> are <em>links</em>, which serve as transitions from  one marker to another. Links demonstrate that God has not changed His mind  about how He will move in human history or suddenly switched to a different  plan of salvation. Instead <em>links</em> show that He is progressively  revealing and accomplishing His plan&#x2014;that the markers are &#x201C;linked&#x201D; together to  form a chain of eventual salvation for mankind. Links show the purposefulness  and cohesiveness of God&#x2019;s work.  </li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some  examples:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>God &#x201C;remembers&#x201D; his covenant (a <em>marker</em>) with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob  (Ex. 2:23-25; 6:5) and orchestrates the Exodus (a new <em>marker</em>).</li>\n    <li> God tells Joshua that He will be with him just  as He was with Moses (the Exodus <em>marker</em>). This comes as God begins a new <em>marker</em>&#x2014;the <u>conquest</u> of the land,  which fulfills a promise made to Abraham.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n  <li>Motifs  or thematic paradigms: Certain  themes regularly surface throughout the telling of God&#x2019;s plan of salvation&#x2014;from  the beginning of Genesis through the end of Revelations. These themes are:\n    <ul>\n      <li><em>Regeneration</em>:  the creation of new life out of chaos  and lifelessness. Consider the creation story in Genesis and Jesus&#x2019; offer to be  re-born spiritually.</li>\n      <li><em>Reconciliation</em>:  God attaching Himself to people. Consider God&#x2019;s promise to Abraham to create a  unique covenant people and Jesus&#x2019; death providing reconciliation with God  through his death on the cross&#x2014;the New Covenant.</li>\n      <li><em>Redemption</em>:  God rescuing people from bondage. Consider the Exodus and salvation through  Jesus providing people the opportunity to have freedom from the bondage of sin.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>These  themes come up again and again because God is progressively fulfilling His goal  of rescuing man from spiritual death, enslavement to sin, purposelessness, and  alienation. Old Testament narratives use these themes to show an incomplete fulfillment  of God&#x2019;s plan of salvation, which is then &#x201C;filled&#x201D; by Jesus, but will be  completely and ultimately fulfilled at history&#x2019;s end. Looking for these themes  will greatly help your ability to see the main point of an Old Testament  narrative and its place in God&#x2019;s overall message of grace and salvation for  people.\n  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"OT Worksheet Intro","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/hermeneutics/OT_worksheet/OTWorksheetIntro.htm"}

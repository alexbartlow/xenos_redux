In  contrast to the &#x201C;holiness&#x201D; of the gods of the ancient world (Exod. 15:11),  Yahweh is holy in an ethical sense.  Holiness relates most closely with God&#x2019;s righteousness, God dwells in &#x201C;unapproachable light&#x201D; (1 Tim. 6:16).</li>\n      <li>God&#x2019;s justice is necessary as a perfect  moral Being: &#x201C;All have sinned and fallen  short of the glory of God&#x201D; (Rom. 3:23).</li>\n      <li>God&#x2019;s  righteousness, his essential holiness, also relates to mercy.

Substantial implications exist for the concept of morality and social  justice. \n        <ul>\n          <li>The purpose of man&#x2019;s  creation is conditioned by the general purpose of the universe. According to the <em>Enuma</em><em> Elish</em>, the universe was created for the  benefit of the gods... Even Babylon was built for the gods... man&#x2019;s creation  was conceived and executed not as an end it itself or as a natural sequel to  the formation of the rest of the universe, but rather as an expedient to  satisfy a group of discontented gods.  Man&#x2019;s purpose in life was to be the serves of the gods... --Alexander Heidel, <em>The Babylonian Genesis</em></li>\n          <li>It is small wonder,  therefore, that all polytheisms tend to be religions of the status quo, and that none of them has  ever produced a thoroughgoing social revolution based upon a high concept of  social justice... In the Bible, however, a state of tension exists between God  and creation... A profound disharmony exists between the will of god and the  existing social order. --G.

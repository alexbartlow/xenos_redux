What role does this scene play in the unfolding narrative? To answer that question we must identify the main point of the entire story. </p>\n<p>Often the narrative's  main point can be found in its closing verses--the plot's resolution. Before drawing a conclusion about the overall main point, make sure you consider each scene--is that  main point is connected to your conclusions about these individual scenes?&#xA0; The more diligence taken with this step, the more sound your \ninterpretation will be.</p>\n<p>Below are commonly used literary devices Old Testament authors used to draw their readers' focus onto the main point of the narrative.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Summary statements:\n<ul>\n      <li>Genesis 1:1 &#x201C;In the beginning God created the  heavens and the earth&#x201D; summarizes&#x2014;and provides the main point&#x2014;of the scene  covered in Genesis 1:1-2:3</li>\n      <li>Ex. 7:2-5 serves as an outline for the general  flow of the plagues that follow\n        <ul>\n          <li>vs.  2: \"Let Israel go\"</li>\n          <li>vs.  3: \"Pharaoh's hard heart\"</li>\n          <li>vs.  3, 4: \"God will multiply signs and wonders...\"</li>\n          <li>vs.  5: \"...<em>so that</em> the Egyptians  will know that Yahweh is the Lord\"</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Repetitions: Repetitions are usually purposeful  and might take the form of:\n    <ul>\n      <li>Formulas: E. g.: 1 &amp; 2 Kings--king is  evaluated as to whether they did \"evil\" or \"good\" in the  eyes of the Lord; </li>\n      <li>Words: &#x201C;Give&#x201D; in Joshua 1</li>\n      <li>Events that are repeated with different people  and contexts, but with the same point or meaning--e.g. Joshua and Moses or  Elijah and Elisha (I Kings 17 and II Kings 4)</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>God speaks: When God breaks into the  narrative&#x2014;either directly or through the words of a prophet&#x2014;it is usually a  vital statement of purpose.

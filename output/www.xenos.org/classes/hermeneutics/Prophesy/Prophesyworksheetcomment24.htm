It may be fulfilled in the short term, serving as a picture for a future  fulfillment, or it may be a dramatic picture of the end of history, which  provides a picture of a nearer term fulfillment that is to come. Here are some  suggestions for picking up on these type of prophetic fulfillments:</li>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Semantic  clues: descriptions of a \"then and then\" fulfillment. See Joel 2:28.</li>\n    <li>Temporal  clues: things that  could not be true of the historical description at hand.  Look at the verb tenses for clues. See Daniel 9:26.</li>\n    <li>Content clues: descriptions  that relate to the <em>universal</em> and <em>eternal</em> rather than just covenant  blessings on Israel.  See Isaiah 19:1-15 &amp; 16-25</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Prophesy worksheet comment 24","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/hermeneutics/Prophesy/Prophesyworksheetcomment24.htm"}

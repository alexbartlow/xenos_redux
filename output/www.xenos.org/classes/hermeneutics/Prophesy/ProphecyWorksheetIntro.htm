See Isaiah  41:22-23, 26; 42:9: 43:9-10; 44:7- 8;  45:21; 46:10-11; and 48:5.</p>\n<p>In Biblical history, most prophets are associated with the  time of the divided monarchy through the resettlement, approximately 800 BC to  400 BC.</p>\n<p><strong>Characteristics  of prophets as preachers to their contemporary culture</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Sensitive to evil: The society in which they  spoke often had become accommodating of and callous to evil. Prophets  sensitized people to their true spiritual state.<strong></strong></li>\n  <li>Confrontational of covenant violations, calling  for social reform in areas such as:</li>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Superficial and apostate religion. See Hosea 6:6; Isaiah 29:13; Jer. 2:8; 7:9-10</li>\n    <li>Materialism,  a love of power, and the wisdom of the world. See Jer. 9:23-24</li>\n    <li>Social  injustice. See Isaiah 10:2</li>\n  </ul>\n  <li>Often heavily burdened by their calling,  suffering in their role:</li>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Threatened and rejected by people, as a sign of  their response to God. See Jer. 26:7-15</li>\n    <li>Martyred. See Heb. 11:37</li>\n    <li>Despairing. See Jer. 20:14-18</li>\n  </ul>\n  <li>Not selective in whom they guided or denounced,  serving an important role in guiding kings. See 2 Kings 19</li>\n  <li>Were often personally affected by their visions,  experiencing horror from bleak predictions of judgments and intense joy from  visions of God&#x2019;s glory and salvation. They were not detached receivers and  communicators of God&#x2019;s word to people.</li>\n  <li>Represented the humiliation of the people. \n    <ul>\n      <li>See Micah 2:8; Isaiah 20</li>\n      <li>In the book of Hosea, Hosea&#x2019;s marriage to the  unfaithful Gomer served as a picture of Israel&#x2019;s unfaithfulness to God,  including the following elements:      \n        <ul>\n          <li>Reason for marriage (1:2)</li>\n          <li>Names of the children (1:3-9)</li>\n          <li>Unfaithful and unknowing Gomer (2:1-13)</li>\n          <li>Hosea pursues and redeems his wife (2:14-3:5)</li>\n          <li>The children are redeemed (1:10-11; 2:1, 23)</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more on this topic see Abraham Heschel's \"What Manner of Man is the Prophet?\" in <em>The Prophets, Volume I</em>.</p>\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Prophecy Worksheet Intro","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/hermeneutics/Prophesy/ProphecyWorksheetIntro.htm"}

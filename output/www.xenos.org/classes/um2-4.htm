The evangelistic principle here for us to imitate (see\n1 Cor. 10:32-11:1) is the principle of cultural identification: Without compromising in\nmoral and/or doctrinal areas, we are to identify as much as possible with the\nnon-Christian culture we are seeking to reach. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>\"though not myself...\" (vs 20,21) - Paul is under grace and living\nwithin biblical moral absolutes. In the area of doctrine and morality, we are not to\ncompromise or else we lose what we have to offer to non- Christians. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>\"to the Jew I became as a Jew . . . to those under the Law, as under the Law\n. . . to those who are without law, as without law . . . to the weak I became weak . . . I\nhave become all things to all men\" - Paul meets people on their level culturally.\nWhen with Jews, he observed their dietary restrictions (wouldn't order bacon with his\neggs). When with pagans, he went naked in the gymnasiums, quoted their authors, etc. </big></p>\n\n<p><big><b>Why is this principle so important?</b> The language of this text makes it\nclear that the observance of this principle is very important in reaching people for\nChrist (\" . . . that I might win . . . \"). When we identify with our audience's\nculture, more people will be reached for Christ. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>If the gospel is really true and really universally applicable, why can't we\nsimply get a tract in every mailbox, a Bible in every house and say that we have\nevangelized people effectively? </big></p>\n\n<p><big>The answer to this should be obvious to all of us. People will not receive a\nmessage which they do not perceive to be relevant to their own lives. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>People tend to view themselves primarily in terms of their own personal\nexperiences and cultural heritage. Therefore, in order to be perceived as meaningful and\nrelevant, the gospel must be communicated in a way with which the non-Christian can\nidentify culturally. Non Christians can't \"hear\" the gospel effectively\notherwise because of the \"noise\" of our different culture. This is why\nmissiologists remind us that people like to be able to become Christians without having to\ncross cultural boundaries. </big></p>\n\n<p><big><b>Discussion Question:</b> How many of you were brought to Christ by someone with\nwhom you could identify personally and culturally? How big of a factor would you say this\nwas? </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Along with the message of grace, this is a key evangelistic principle. In fact, it\nis an expression of the message of grace. Just as we do not make people change morally\nbefore they can come to Christ, so we don't insist that they change culturally in order to\ncome to Christ. Christ himself is our example for this principle. He definitely\n\"changed cultures\" to reach man! Out of love, the Christian should make the\neffort necessary to do just this. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>But there is an unconscious tendency for Christians to identify Christianity with\ntheir own personal cultural tastes and thus to drift into a cultural \"ghetto\"\nthat needlessly alienates non-Christians from Christ. When this is the case, Christians\noften misinterpret non-Christians' distaste for their cultural tastes as \"hardness to\nthe gospel.\" The resultant perspective is sometimes called a \"fortress\"\nmentality. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Christians sit safely inside the walls of their church and church culture, judging\nthe non-Christian world for its \"worldliness\" and hardness of heart. When this\nhappens, the message of the gospel becomes effectively sealed off from all but those who\nhappen to identify with the \"Christian\" culture. And, tragically, Christianity\nis not seen as the personally and culturally relevant world-view that it is, but instead\nas an irrelevant anachronism. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>For this reason, church structures and strategies must be formulated in a way\nwhich not only promote true spirituality, but also cultural identification with the\nsociety to be reached. This has been a key distinctive of Xenos through the years, and\naccounts for a large measure of our evangelistic success. </big></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><big>Discussion:</big></h3>\n\n<p><big><b>What are some examples of the application of this principle at Xenos?</b> <br>\n</big></p>\n\n<h4><big>Central Teachings (Seeker-Sensitive Meetings)</big></h4>\n\n<p><big>Xenos calls its large meetings (in place since 1976) <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/ct/ct.htm\">\"Central Teachings\"</a> because we began as a\ncollection of home churches. The teachings we shared were centralized, unlike the rest of\nour activities. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>The purpose of the Seekers' meetings is to provide the non-Christian with a\n\"safe place to hear a dangerous message.\" Every aspect of the meeting has been\ndesigned with the unchurched seeker in mind. The atmosphere is casual and unchurchy. The\ndress is also casual. The meeting is large enough for the unchurched person to feel safely\nanonymous while he investigates. The musical style\nand content is selected to impact the seeker rather than to promote corporate worship for\nthe Christian attenders. Other modern media (such as computer graphics) are used to\ncommunicate the relevance of Christianity to modern unchurched people. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>The teachings are filled with contemporary language and examples; theological\nwords are explained and we avoid \"Christianese.\" We use a contemporary version\nof the Bible. Collections of money are announced with a specific disclaimer to the seeker\nthat he should not feel obligated to give. <br>\n</big></p>\n\n<h4><big>Parties:</big></h4>\n\n<p><big>One of the main purposes for parties is to give non-Christian friends the\nopportunity to discover that Christians in Xenos are culturally and personally relevant\npeople. Sometimes, the non- Christians may drink too much or become rowdy, but we feel\nthat parties are still an effective way of communicating the cultural \"common\nground\" that we share with non-Christians, and therefore open up additional\nopportunities to discuss Christianity. <br>\n</big></p>\n\n<h4><big>Attending Bars and Non-Christian Parties: </big></h4>\n\n<p><big>When Jesus was invited to parties held by \"sinners,\" he accepted. He\nevidently did this so much that he became liable to the erroneous charge that he was a\n\"wine-bibber and a glutton\" (Mt. 11:19). When he was rebuked by religious people\nfor this practice, he defended himself by reminding them that he \"did not come to\ncall the righteous, but sinners\" (Mt. 9:13). </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Jesus loved lost people enough to identify with them culturally in this setting.\nChristians have this same privilege and responsibility (although some may not have the\nself-control to handle these settings). </big></p>\n\n<h4><big>Taking in Non-Christian Movies, Books, Music, etc.:</big></h4>\n\n<p><big>Media is a powerful expression of culture. Therefore, those who wish to reach\nnon-Christian people do well to understand the media of that culture. It is evident that\nPaul read Greek and Roman literature because he quotes it many times in his speeches and\nletters. By demonstrating an awareness of non-Christian books, movies and music, we open\ndoors of receptivity to the message of Christ. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Some object to this practice by saying that non-Christian media contains false and\nimmoral content. Of course, this is true. However, the Christian is equipped with the Word\nof God with which to discern truth from error. If his motivation is to more effectively\nreach non-Christians for Christ, he should be applauded rather than judged. </big></p>\n\n<h3><big>Discussion:</big></h3>\n\n<p><big>Did any of the above four factors play into your own salvation, or someone else's\nthat you know? If so, explain how. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Some Christians can communicate a very clear, crisp explanation of the gospel\nmessage, but are really lacking in the cultural identification department. Other\nChristians can relate beautifully with the culture, but often find themselves tongue-tied,\nshy, or they let golden opportunities float by to explain Christ to the non-Christian.\nSome Christians are pretty good at both or neither of these elements. Which of these most\ncharacterizes you these days? </big></p>\n\n\n\n<p><big><a href=\"mailto:DeLashmuttG@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Ask Gary a question\nor share a comment.</a> <br>\n<a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Ask Dennis a question or share a\ncomment.</a> <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to Xenos Home Page</a> <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/und_min.htm\">Return to Understanding Ministry Table of Contents</a> <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/um2-5.htm\">Read on to the next section in Understanding Ministry</a>  </big></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Evangelism and Cultural Identification","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/um2-4.htm"}

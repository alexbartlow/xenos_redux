(Psalms 127:1,2) God's power is released into ministry situations through\nprayer, as the following passages demonstrate. Not only did the apostles feel the need to\nhave their own ministries supported by prayer, they sought to accomplish ministry in\nothers through prayer. </big>\n\n</p><ul>\n  <li><big>Eph. 6:18,19 \"With all prayer and petition pray at all times in the Spirit,\n    and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the\n    saints, and pray on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my\n    mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel.\" </big></li>\n  <li><big>2 Thess. 3:1 \"Finally, brethren, pray for us that the word of the Lord may\n    spread rapidly and be glorified, just as {it did} also with you\" </big></li>\n  <li><big>Heb. 13:18 \"Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a good conscience,\n    desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things.\" </big></li>\n  <li><big>Col. 1:9 \"For this reason also, since the day we heard {of it}, we have not\n    ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in\n    all spiritual wisdom and understanding.\" </big></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><big>Groups that persistently pray for evangelism, and who pray for non-Christians by\nname will eventually receive answers to their prayers. Groups that feel no need to pray\nfor evangelism eventually lose their ability to do evangelism. This is either because they\ntend to rely on human will power through pressure tactics, or they become demoralized and\nturn to other endeavors. </big></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><big>Discussion</big></h3>\n\n<p><big>Have the group describe how these things have been true in their experience or\nobservation. </big></p>\n\n\n\n<p><big><a href=\"mailto:DeLashmuttG@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Ask Gary a question\nor share a comment.</a> <br>\n<a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Ask Dennis a question or share a\ncomment.</a> <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to Xenos Home Page</a> <br>\n  <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/homegroups/index.htm\">Return to the Home Group Home Page</a> <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/und_min.htm\">Return to Understanding Ministry Table of Contents</a> <br>\n  <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/um2-6.htm\">Read on to the next section in Understanding Ministry</a> \n  </big></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Evangelistic Prayer Ministry of the Church","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/um2-5.htm"}

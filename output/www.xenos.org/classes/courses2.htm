Most of our training occurs in the field--in home groups or ministry\nteams, where we foster personal discipleship. However, we also believe lay leaders need\nsupport in the area of formal training. Hence we offer a broad suite of adult courses.\nMost of our <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/minteam.htm\">ministry teams</a> require some level of formal\ncourse work for their workers. Taking courses has become the \"thing to do\" at\nXenos, and most committed members look forward to taking a great, informative and\nchallenging course at least once a year. </p>\n\n<p>We are also convinced that growing to maturity is rooted in a deep knowledge of God's\nWord and how it applies to all areas of life. </p>\n\n<p>As you investigate further, you will see that we have put together an elaborate,\npractical core of courses for Christians at every stage of spiritual development. </p>\n\n<p>That's why every year we have over 1200 registrants enrolling in at least 25 different\nclasses! All of the classes charge tuition, usually about $25 for 5 week courses and $50\nfor 10 week courses. No, the tuition does not pay our expenses! We simply believe that\nunless students pay for education, they will not fully value it. Poor students can apply\nfor relief, either in the form of payment schedules or waiving of most (but never all) of\nthe tuition. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>About the Staff:</h3>\n\n<p>The adult education staff brings a dynamic blend of advanced academic credentials and\nyears of practical ministry experience into the classroom. Of the 22 regular instructors,\nover half hold masters or doctoral degrees. Xenos instructors have been involved in\nnationwide publication of 8 books. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Major Areas of Study</h2>\n\n<h3>Biblical Studies:</h3>\n\n<p>Xenos respects the authority of Scripture. We recognize that the scripture is\n\"living and active,\" and that drinking deep from the riches of scripture\ntransforms our lives. So we have numerous courses to facilitate knowledge of the Bible,\nand Bible study skills. The introductory courses in Biblical Studies are: \n\n</p><ul>\n  <li><b>New and Old Testament Surveys</b> These 5 week courses acquaint students to the\n    history, literature and theology of the Bible. The plan of salvation, the Bible's core\n    message, is chronicled from Genesis to Revelation. These survey courses are rich in\n    content, but designed with the young Christian in mind. Students are expected to read\n    major sections of the Bible and summarize their observations as well as pass a test to\n    evidence knowledge of the key thematic and historical issues covered in the presentations.\n    We offer a course in inductive study method. Students are taught inductive method and how\n    to use word study tools. These skills are developed as the workshop-style class applies\n    the inductive principles to Paul's prison letters. By the end of this 5 week class,\n    students have the ability to do in depth Bible study on their own--a life changing\n    experience! More advanced courses are offered in New and Old Testament books. These 5 to\n    10 week courses range from Hebrews and General Epistles, to the Gospels, the Prophets and\n    the Pentateuch. Authorship and historicity are examined, as well as theological and\n    textual issues. Students complete detailed inductive studies. The instructor facilitates a\n    healthy \"give and take\" as students defend their interpretation of the text.\n    Students complete the course having written their own inductive commentary of the book(s)\n    studied. </li>\n  <li><b>Inductive Book Studies </b>In-depth book studies stressing personal study and\n    interpretation skills are popular. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to the Xenos home page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/equip.htm\">Return to Equipping Page</a> <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/index.htm\">See a listing of courses</a>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Adult Education: Philosophy and Faculty","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/courses2.htm"}

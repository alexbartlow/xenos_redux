And as for His stretched-out hand, who can turn it\n    back?\"</p>\n    <p>40:15-18, 21-23 Behold, the nations are like a drop from a\n    bucket, And are regarded as a speck of dust on the scales; Behold, He lifts up the islands\n    like fine dust. Even Lebanon is not enough to burn, Nor its beasts enough for a burnt\n    offering. All the nations are as nothing before Him, They are regarded by Him as less than\n    nothing and meaningless. To whom then will you liken God? Or what likeness will you\n    compare with Him?&#x85;Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been declared to\n    you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth? It is\n    He who sits above the vault of the earth, And its inhabitants are like grasshoppers, Who\n    stretches out the heavens like a curtain And spreads them out like a tent to dwell in. He\n    it is who reduces rulers to nothing, Who makes the judges of the earth meaningless.</p>\n    <p>45:9-10 \"Woe to the one who quarrels with his Maker--\n    An earthenware vessel among the vessels of earth! Will the clay say to the potter, 'What\n    are you doing?' Or the thing you are making say, 'He has no hands'? \"Woe to him who\n    says to a father, 'What are you begetting?' Or to a woman, 'To what are you giving\n    birth?'\"</p>\n    <p>45:6b-7, 9, 21-24 That men may know from the rising to the\n    setting of the sun That there is no one besides Me. I am the LORD, and there is no other,\n    The One forming light and creating darkness, Causing well-being and creating calamity; I\n    am the LORD who does all these&#x85;.\"Woe to the one who quarrels with his Maker-- An\n    earthenware vessel among the vessels of earth! Will the clay say to the potter, 'What are\n    you doing?' Or the thing you are making say, 'He has no hands'?&#x85; \"Declare and\n    set forth your case; Indeed, let them consult together. Who has announced this from of\n    old? Who has long since declared it? Is it not I, the LORD? And there is no other God\n    besides Me, A righteous God and a Savior; There is none except Me. \"Turn to Me, and\n    be saved, all the ends of the earth; For I am God, and there is no other. \"I have\n    sworn by Myself, The word has gone forth from My mouth in righteousness And will not turn\n    back, That to Me every knee will bow, every tongue will swear allegiance. \"They will\n    say of Me, 'Only in the LORD are righteousness and strength.' Men will come to Him, And\n    all who were angry at Him shall be put to shame.</p>\n    <p>46:10-11 Declaring the end from the beginning And from\n    ancient times things which have not been done, Saying, 'My purpose will be established,\n    And I will accomplish all My good pleasure'; Calling a bird of prey from the east, The man\n    of My purpose from a far country. Truly I have spoken; truly I will bring it to pass. I\n    have planned it, surely I will do it.</p>\n    <p>49:22-50:3 Thus says the Lord GOD, \"Behold, I will\n    lift up My hand to the nations, And set up My standard to the peoples; And they will bring\n    your sons in their bosom, And your daughters will be carried on their shoulders. \"And\n    kings will be your guardians, And their princesses your nurses. They will bow down to you\n    with their faces to the earth, And lick the dust of your feet; And you will know that I am\n    the LORD; Those who hopefully wait for Me will not be put to shame. \"Can the prey be\n    taken from the mighty man, Or the captives of a tyrant be rescued?\" Surely, thus says\n    the LORD, \"Even the captives of the mighty man will be taken away, And the prey of\n    the tyrant will be rescued; For I will contend with the one who contends with you, And I\n    will save your sons. \"And I will feed your oppressors with their own flesh, And they\n    will become drunk with their own blood as with sweet wine; And all flesh will know that I,\n    the LORD, am your Savior, And your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.\" Thus says the\n    LORD, \"Where is the certificate of divorce, By which I have sent your mother away? Or\n    to whom of My creditors did I sell you? Behold, you were sold for your iniquities, And for\n    your transgressions your mother was sent away. \"Why was there no man when I came?\n    When I called, why was there none to answer? Is My hand so short that it cannot ransom? Or\n    have I no power to deliver? Behold, I dry up the sea with My rebuke, I make the rivers a\n    wilderness; Their fish stink for lack of water, And die of thirst. \"I clothe the\n    heavens with blackness, And I make sackcloth their covering.\"</p>\n    <p>51:13-16 That you have forgotten the LORD your Maker, Who\n    stretched out the heavens, And laid the foundations of the earth; That you fear\n    continually all day long because of the fury of the oppressor, As he makes ready to\n    destroy? But where is the fury of the oppressor? \"The exile will soon be set free,\n    and will not die in the dungeon, nor will his bread be lacking. \"For I am the LORD\n    your God, who stirs up the sea and its waves roar (the LORD of hosts is His name).\n    \"And I have put My words in your mouth, and have covered you with the shadow of My\n    hand, to establish the heavens, to found the earth, and to say to Zion, 'You are My\n    people.'\"</p>\n    <p>55:11 So shall My word be which goes forth from My mouth;\n    It shall not return to Me empty, Without accomplishing what I desire, And without\n    succeeding in the matter for which I sent it.</p></td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Isaiah: Theology Proper and Chapters 56-66","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/Isaiah/isweek5.htm"}

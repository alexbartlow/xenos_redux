Since this time,\nothers have advanced arguments in support of dual or even multiple authorship. Others have\nargued for one author, Isaiah.

At least two possibilities exist:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>The passages are recorded chronologically and this is when\n      God&#x92;s commission occurred in the narrative. Thus the earlier chapters reflect earlier\n      revelations of Isaiah prior to his vision.</li>\n    <li>The passages are not, necessarily, recorded chronologically.\n      Thus the vision is placed after the first five chapters for literary and logical reasons\n      (i.e. to set up the context for Isaiah&#x92;s commission.)</li>\n    <li>6:11-13; This is an important passage b/c it is indisputably\n      written by Isaiah and b/c it makes a prediction over 150 years in advance&#x85;the very\n      reason that the anti-supernaturalists reject so much of the rest of Isaiah as authentic.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <ul>\n      <li>vv. 11-12 say that Judah will be devastated and depopulated;\n        something that happened over 150 years after Isaiah.</li>\n      <li>v. 13 says literally, \"but [there will] still be a\n        tenth-part in it [i.e. the exiled people] and it will return [<i>w<sup>e</sup>sabah</i>]\n        and it will be for burning [i.e. subjected to fiery trials], like a terebinth or like an\n        oak, which in [their] felling [still have] a root-stump in them, a holy seed [shall be]\n        its root-stump.\"</li>\n      <li><i>w<sup>e</sup>sabah</i> is held to mean \"again\"\n        by higher critics meaning, \"and it will again be subject to burning\" thus\n        eliminating the interpretation \"it shall return\" from the verb <i>sub</i>\n        \"to return\"; this dampens the prediction but fails to eliminate it.</li>\n      <li>However, these analysts have failed to translate <i>w<sup>e</sup>sabah</i>\n        properly because three verses later he gives his firstborn son the name \"a remnant\n        shall return,\" which is what Shear-jashub means, a translation that no critic denies;\n        where else would he come up with such a name if not from 6:13?

John\n      Wesley said, \"If a man will not believe God, he will believe anything.\"\n      Ahaz&#x92;s unbelief is so strong he will not permit proof of its falseness.</li>\n    <li><i>House of David....the Lord himself will give <u>you</u> a\n      sign. \"you\" is plural until verse 16 when Ahaz himself is addressed.</i></li>\n    <li>\"sign\" a signal with supernatural elements; this\n      sign touches on the Davidic covenant--how it will be fulfilled.</li>\n    <li><i>alma = maid or young woman but it always means an\n      unmarried woman; bethshira = a technical term for a virgin but it is occasionally used of\n      a married woman (Joel 1:18; Deut.22); alma is actually a better choice for a prophetic\n      double reference.</i></li>\n    <li>Young says that in cognate languages (e.g. Ugaritic, Syriac\n      and Arabic) <i>alma</i> is used to mean virgin and in fact, the earliest LXX translates it\n      as <i>parthenos</i> the definitive Greek word for virgin.</li>\n    <li>Rabbinic commentary on this passage is interesting: <ul>\n        <li>Rasheeth says, \"Behold the almah...the girl will be one\n          who has never had intercourse\" </li>\n        <li>In the Talmud, Rabbi Humni in the name of Rabbi Joshua\n          writes, \"This is messiah of whom it is said, this day I have begotten you\"</li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>A real challenge with this passage is its connection with\n      Ahaz&#x92;s time when it appears to refer to Christ. This is an apparent prophetic\n      double-reference. The early reference appears to be to Mahershalalhashbaz (8:1-4). If the\n      passage refers to the childs mental capacity, then it concerns the destruction of Syria in\n      3 years. If the passage refers to the childs moral capacity, then it concerns the\n      destruction of Israel 12 years hence.

Furthermore, there are prophecies which seem to \n    focus on the immediate historical context of the prophet, yet there is a more \n    complete fulfillment later. This tendency to speak of events that are separated \n    by time as though they were not separated is called the principle of <strong>double \n    reference</strong>. </p>\n  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>(<strong>J. Dwight Pentecost</strong>) \"<strong>Two events, widely \n      separated as to the time of their fulfillment, may be brought together into \n      the scope of one prophecy</strong>. This was done because the prophet had \n      a message for his own day as well as for a future time&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;It \n      was the purpose of God to give the near and far view so that the fulfillment \n      of the one should be the assurance of the fulfillment of the other.\" \n      (J. Dwight Pentecost, <i>Things To Come</i> [Grand Rapids: Zondervan Publishing \n      House, 1964], pp.&#xA0;46,47.)</p>\n    <p><strong>The phenomenon of double reference prophecy to reveal God's plan \n      is common in and unique to the Bible.</strong> The Old Testament employs \n      four different kinds of double-reference prophecy: Type, Gap, Type-gap, \n      and Unforeseen partial.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <h3>Type</h3>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p><strong>The Old Testament prophet describes an event, person, or institution \n        (\"type\") and later Scripture reveals the prophetic significance \n        of this event, person, or institution (\"anti-type\").</strong> \n        <br>\n      </p>\n      <p>This subsequent event usually pertains to Christ or the events surrounding \n        one of his comings. Typology is also present in many Old Testament rituals.<br>\n      </p>\n      <p>Typological interpretation is different than allegorical interpretation, \n        because there must be some explicit scriptural basis for identifying the \n        type and anti-type. </p>\n      <p>Note to the instructor: \"Type\" is the English translation of \n        the Greek word <i>parabolay, </i>which means <i>a placing beside </i>or \n        <i>comparison</i>. A type forshadows the antitype - a future event or \n        person that is similar to the type. \"Antitype\" comes from the \n        Greek word <i>antitupon, </i>which is literally <i>to be struck back</i> \n        or <i>to correspond to</i>. Think of an antitype as a mold, and the type \n        as the thing being molded.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><strong>Examples:</strong><b> </b>Num. 21:9 (see Jn. 3:14,15);&#xA0;Gen. \n      6; </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p><b>(Num. 21:8,9)</b> The LORD said to Moses, \"Make \n        a snake and put it up on a pole; anyone who is bitten can look at it and \n        live.\" (9) So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. \n        Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, \n        he lived.</p>\n      <p>In Num. 21:9, God predicts to Moses that if anyone looks to the brazen \n        serpent Moses lifts up, they will be healed from the serpents' venomous \n        bite.</p>\n      <p><strong>Fulfillment:</strong>&#xA0; Jesus declares that this event foreshadowed \n        him being lifted up (on the cross) so that whoever believes in him may \n        be forgiven. </p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p><b>(Jn.&#xA0;3:14,15)</b> Just as Moses lifted up the \n          snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, (15) that \n          everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><b>Additional Examples: </b></p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Gen. 6: Noah's rescue from the flood through the Ark foreshadowed believers' \n        rescue from God's judgment through \"baptism\" into Christ (1 \n        Pet. 3). </p>\n      <p>Old Testament atonement rituals (see Heb. 8-10); Dan. 8:17-26; Jer. 31:15 \n        (see Mt. 2:17,18) </p>\n      \n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <h3>Gap</h3>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><strong>Definition: </strong></p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p><strong>The prophet predicts two dissimilar events, widely \n        separated by time, as though they were one event. </strong><br>\n        It should be noticed in this case that the predictive material referring \n        to the later event will not fit the earlier event.

This \n      kingdom, however, appears to have two phases. </p>\n    <p><strong>Part I (vs. 40):</strong> Two legs encompass both east and west. \n      It is much more powerful than the other kingdoms (\" . . . crushes and \n      shatters . . . \"). </p>\n    <p><strong>Reasons for seeing a <em>Prophetic Gap</em> between vs. 40,41</strong> \n      (more evidence for a gap will be provided in subsequent visions): </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Anatomical distinction:</strong> Vs 40 refers to the legs, while \n        vs. 41 refers to the feet. </li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Composition distinction:</strong> The legs are composed entirely \n        of iron, while the feet are composed of iron and clay. </li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>This part of the vision is still unfulfilled.</strong> Vs 44 \n        says that \"in the days of those kings\" (the 10 nations), the \n        God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed.\" \n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><strong>Part II (vs. 41-43):</strong> reasons for \"iron and clay\" \n    </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Vs 41: It is a divided kingdom, but has the toughness of iron. </p>\n      <p>Vs 42: Some of its nations are strong, while some of them are weak (diverse \n        forms of government?). </p>\n      <p>Vs 43: There are evidently futile attempts to unify different nations \n        and nationalistic interests through political alliances. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><strong>Stone That Becomes a Mountain</strong> (vs. 44): GOD'S KINGDOM \n      evidently destroys the kingdom of iron and clay. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Daniel 7: 4 Beasts </strong></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Daniel receives this vision in 553 BC (vs. 1), between the events of chapters \n      4 &amp; 5. The \"sea\" (vs. 2) from which the beasts arise is equated \n      with the \"earth\" (vs. 17), and probably refers to Gentile humanity. \n      This vision clearly correlates with the vision in chapter 2. </p>\n    <p><strong>Note: </strong>The beasts <strong>descend in <em>majesty</em> </strong>(correlating \n      to the metals' <i>value</i> in chapter 2), but <strong>increase in <em>terror</em></strong> \n      (corresponding to the metals' <i>strength</i> in chapter 2). </p>\n    <p><strong>Lion with Eagle's Wings</strong><i> (vs. 4): </i>NEBUCHADNEZZAR \n      and NEO-BABYLON. Since the head of gold referred to Nebuchadnezzar and Babylon, \n      it seems logical that the first beast is about the same kingdom. Jer. 4:7 \n      uses similar imagery to refer to Babylon. Winged lions guarded the gates \n      of the royal palaces. These are two most kingly of animals of the land and \n      air respectively. The wings plucked and a human mind given to it probably \n      refers to the events in Dan. 4:28-37. </p>\n    <p> <strong>Bear </strong><i>(</i>vs. 5): MEDIA-PERSIA. It was powerful and \n      ferocious, but less swift than Neo-Babylon. \"Raised up on one side\" \n      probably refers to the dominance of the Persians over the Medes. The Persians \n      came up last, but were greater and absorbed the Medes (see 8:3,20). The \n      \"three ribs\" may refer to three decisive battles, three geographical \n      components of the empire (Media, Persia, and Babylon), or to three peoples \n      subdued by them (Babylonians; Lydians; Egyptians). </p>\n    <p><strong>Leopard with Four Wings &amp; Four Heads</strong> (vs. 6): GREECE. \n      The leopard was less grand, but far swifter and greatly feared as a beast \n      of prey. The four wings emphasize great speed. Alexander the Great conquered \n      most of the known civilized world (from Macedonia to India) within 10-15 \n      years. The four heads refer to the four generals who divided his kingdom \n      after his premature death in 323 BC (see 8:8 for details). </p>\n    <p><strong>Terrible Beast </strong>(vs. 7a-11,19-26): ROME. Note the similarities \n      with the statue (iron teeth; crushing and trampling down all before it). \n      Note also the two phases: </p>\n    <p><strong>Part I</strong> (vs. 7,23): It will be more powerful and have larger \n      rule than the other kingdoms. Unlike the Greeks, who preferred to absorb \n      culturally while granting relative political autonomy, Rome ruthlessly crushed \n      and slew the peoples they conquered (e.g., Carthage where the Romans slew \n      all the inhabitants, threw the buildings into the sea, and sewed the land \n      with salt). </p>\n    <p><strong>Part II </strong>(vs. 7b,8,24-26): This is based on the <b>Prophetic \n      Gap</b> in chapter 2, and the fact that there is no historical fulfillment \n      yet. </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p><strong>The ten horns refer to ten kings</strong> (as in 2:44) who arise \n        out of this kingdom, evidently ruling simultaneously. </p>\n      <p><strong>The \"little horn\" is not one of the ten</strong>, but \n        arises after they come into power and deposes three of them. This is the \n        Anti-Christ. His \"boasts\" (vs. 8) are actually \"speaking \n        out against the Most High\" (vs. 25). He persecutes Jewish believers \n        (vs. 25) and attempts to make major changes in the Jewish calendar and \n        law. \"Time, times, and half a time\" probably refers to the first \n        3.5 years of the tribulation, during which God grants him authority (see \n        Dan. 9:27). Vs 26 probably refers to the second 3.5 years, during which \n        he is judged by God (Dan. 9:27)&#x97;or simply to his destruction when \n        Messiah comes. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><b>Son of Man's Eternal Kingdom (vs 9-14,18,27)</b></p>\n    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Vs 12 contrasts the end of the first three kingdoms \n      to that of the last. Unlike the last one, which is annihilated completely \n      (evidently by God's kingdom), they are conquered by other human kingdoms \n      but allowed to go on existing in some form. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Daniel 8: Male Goat &amp; Ram </strong></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><strong>Ram with Two Horns</strong> (vs. 3,4): MEDIA-PERSIA (vs. 20). Note \n      the two horns' similarity to two shoulders of the bear in chapter 7. Just \n      as one of the bear's two shoulders was higher than the other (7:5), so also \n      one of the ram's two horns is longer than the other (8:3). This kingdom \n      did in fact expand northward, southward, and westward. </p>\n    <p><strong>Male Goat </strong>(vs. 5-8a): GREECE (vs. 21). Compare the description \n      in 7:6 (\"leopard with four wings of a bird\") to 8:5 (\"without \n      touching the ground\")&#x97;speed. The large horn is Alexander the Great, \n      who defeated the Persians in three decisive battles in 334,333,331 BC. He \n      died at the height of his power at 33 years old in 323 BC. Vs 8b,22 describe \n      his four generals who divided his kingdom (\"Give it to the strong\"): \n      Seleucus (Syria and lands to the east), Ptolemy (Egypt, Palestine and Arabia), \n      Lysimachus (Turkey), and Cassander (Macedonia and Greece). During the Inter-testamental \n      period, the Seleucid and Ptolemaic kingdoms took turns controlling Palestine \n      because of its strategic importance on the trade route. </p>\n    <p><strong>The \"little horn\"</strong> is the Seleucid king Antiochus \n      IV (Epiphanes), who ruled over Palestine 175-164 BC. What is his relationship \n      to the \"little horn\" in chapter 7? </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p><strong>Similarities between him and the \"little horn\" of chapter \n        7:</strong> boasters (7:20; 8:11,25), \"little horn\" (7:8; 8:9), \n        fight with saints (7:25; 8:24). </p>\n      <p><strong>Differences from the \"little horn\" of chapter 7: </strong>They \n        emerge from different kingdoms (AC is from fourth in Dan. 7; AE is from \n        third in Dan. 8), and their period of dominance over Israel is of different \n        duration (AC is 3.5 years; AE is 6.5 years/2300 days). </p>\n      <p><strong>Resolution:</strong> Antiochus IV is a <b>Type </b>of the Anti-Christ, \n        which is inferred by 8:17,19 (\"<i>pertains</i> to time the end\"). \n      </p>\n      <p>8:11-14 was fulfilled when Antiochus IV removed the high priest Onias \n        III from 171 BC until 164 BC (2300 days), when Antiochus died. The \"abomination \n        of desolation\" (vs. 13: \"the transgression causes horror\") \n        occurred on December 25, 167 BC, when Antiochus IV sacrificed a swine \n        on the altar of the temple. This sacrilege precipitated the Maccabean \n        Revolt (see Josephus, <i>Antiquities</i>, Book XII, Chapter 5; 1 Macc. \n        4:34ff.). </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Daniel 9: The Prince Who Is To Come </strong></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><strong>Vs 24: Summary of the entire 70 \"weeks\" and what will \n      happen afterwards (the millennial kingdom). </strong></p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Daniel receives this vision in 538 BC (9:1), as the Jews are nearing \n        the end of their 70 year exile for disregarding the land Sabbaths (9:2; \n        see also Lev. 25:1-7; 26:34,35,43; 2 Chron. 36:20,21). </p>\n      <p>This context is the key to understanding the \"weeks\" as weeks \n        of years. The Jews had disregarded the land Sabbath law for 490 years, \n        since God exiled them one year for every land Sabbath disregarded. Now, \n        God reveals to Daniel the next 490 years of his dealings with Israel. \n      </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><strong>Vs 25: Summary of the first 69 \"weeks\"&#x97;7 \"weeks\" \n      for the rebuilding of Jerusalem, and 62 \"weeks\" intervening between \n      the completion and Messiah. </strong></p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>The only decree that authorized a full rebuilding of Jerusalem (including \n        fortifications) was the one given in 444 BC by Artexerxes Langimanus (see \n        Neh. 2:1-8). </p>\n      <p>Converting from Daniel's 360-day lunar years to our present solar years \n        makes 69 \"weeks\" just over 476 years long. Crossing from BC \n        to AD requires that we move one year further because there is no \"zero\" \n        year. This brings us to 33 AD, the very year that Jesus rode into Jerusalem \n        and was hailed as Messiah by the multitude of disciples (see Luke 19:35-44). \n        Notice that when Jesus predicts the destruction of Jerusalem in Luke 19:42-44, \n        he is merely repeating what Daniel predicted on Dan. 9:26 (see below). \n      </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><strong>Vs 26: The gap of time between the 69th and 70th \"weeks.\"</strong> \n      The break from describing this period as pertaining to the weeks strongly \n      implies that it should be viewed as a gap of unspecified duration. During \n      this gap, Messiah will be rejected and killed, the people of the prince \n      to come (i.e., the Romans) will destroy Jerusalem and the Temple, and there \n      will be many wars over Jerusalem. This corresponds exactly to the \"gap\" \n      already deduced in chapters 2 and 7. Jesus calls this same period \"the \n      times of the Gentiles\" which begins when the Romans destroy Jerusalem \n      (Lk. 21:24)&#x97;in other words, the Church Age. </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>The \"prince who is to come\" who desolates the Temple (9:26,27) \n        has already been mentioned in chapter 7 (\"little horn\") and \n        will be mentioned in chapter 11. This is clearly the Anti-Christ who emerges \n        from the Roman Empire and who is judged by God himself immediately before \n        he sets up Messiah's kingdom (9:24,27). He is from the \"people\" \n        who will destroy Jerusalem&#x97;the Roman general Titus fulfilled this \n        in 70 AD, which Jesus also predicted in Lk. 19,21. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><strong>Vs 27: Summary of the 70th \"week.\" This is the tribulation.&#xA0; \n      </strong>The prince begins it by making a covenant. He evidently breaks \n      this covenant 3.5 years later by suspending legitimate worship in the Temple \n      and setting up the abomination of desolation. This brings God's judgment \n      on him over the next 3.5 years, culminating in the second coming of Messiah \n      and the millennial kingdom. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Daniel 11,12: Warring Kingdoms </strong></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><strong>11:1,2 refer to four more kings of Persia</strong>&#x97;Cambyses, \n      Pseudo-Smerdis, Darius I Hystapses, and Xerxes I. </p>\n    <p><strong>11:3,4 refer to Alexander the Great and his four generals.</strong> \n    </p>\n    <p><strong>11:5-20 describes the fate of two of the Greek kingdoms with reference \n      to Israel.</strong> The \"king of the South\" (vs. 5,8) refers to \n      the Ptolemaic empire, while the \"king of the North\" (vs. 6,11,13,15) \n      refers to the Seleucid empire. It deals with the battles between them during \n      the 150 years following Alexander's death. This is covered in great detail \n      (which is why the liberals late-date it) because it was of great concern \n      for the Jews who went through it. </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Vs. 17 refers to when the Seleucid king Antiochus \n        the Great gave his daughter (Cleopatra) to marry the seven year old Ptolemy \n        V in 192 BC.

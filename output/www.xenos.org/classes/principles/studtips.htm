The instructor’s stories are asides that help illustrate the main point, but do not lose site of the main point- write it down if it is not already provided.</li>\n<li>Don’t just ignore unfamiliar or difficult terms and concepts.  Write them down and get answers. </li>\n<li>Reread your notes soon after the lecture.  Correct errors and note sections that are confusing.  Ask the instructor to clarify. </li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Memorization</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Set a regular study time and stick to it (preferably 2 times per week, some people like to do a little each day).</li>\n<li>Break long verses into smaller chunks and memorize a piece at a time.</li>\n<li>Visual learners: Divide a piece of paper into three columns. Write reference (chapter and verse) in first column, the subject (such as  \"Abrahamic Covenant\") in second column and the quote in the third.  Try to recite( or write) the quote from memory with only the subject or reference as a prompt. </li>\n<li>Auditory learners: Tape record references, quotes, and subjects.  Playback the reference. Pause tape to quote the verse from memory.  Also state the subject addressed by that verse. Play prerecorded quote and subject to check your accuracy. </li>\n<li>Kinesthetic learners: Write reference and quote on one side of flash card.  Write the subject addressed by that verse on other side. Flash one side and try to recite the other.</li>\n<li>Get a study partner and quiz each other</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Test Taking</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Walk into test and write down reference, subject and 2-3 keywords to help remember the content of each memory verse. Make this quick, 5-10 minutes at the most.  Use this list as you take the test. </li>\n<li>Skim the test and answer the questions that you know best first.  Of the other questions, answer the ones with the highest point value next. Leave the lower point value/less certain questions for last. </li>\n<li>With each section of the test, read the directions carefully and circle key terms in the directions (like compare, summarize, define, and contrast). </li>\n<li>Before answering true/false questions, circle the key words so that you don’t miss them (like never, most, always, all).</li>\n<li>Recheck all of your work if you have time. </li></ol>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/index.htm\">Christian Principles Index Page</a> \n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Study Tips for Xenos Christian Principles Class","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/principles/studtips.htm"}

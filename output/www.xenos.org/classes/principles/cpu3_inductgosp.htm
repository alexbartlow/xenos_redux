Samaritans and Gentiles (10:25-37; 17:11-19; 14:15-24). Only Luke \n            records the parable of the Good Samaritan (10:25-27) and the story \n            of the ten lepers who were cleansed, with only the Samaritan leper \n            returning to give thanks. </p>\n          <blockquote> \n            <p>Good Samaritan (10:25-37).<br>\n            </p>\n            <p>10 lepers cleansed (17:11-19).</p>\n          </blockquote>\n          <p>2. Women. Luke has far more women in his account than do the other \n            Gospels. </p>\n          <blockquote>\n            <p>The birth narratives are told from the perspectives of Elizabeth \n              and Mary (chaps. 1-2). <br>\n            </p>\n            <p>The prophetess Anna appears alongside her male counterpart Simeon \n              (2:25-38). <br>\n            </p>\n            <p>Jesus affirms the notoriously sinful woman who anoints him with \n              oil despite the complaints of his pharisaic host (7:36-50). <br>\n            </p>\n            <p>He praises Mary's (Martha's sister) devotion to his teaching, against \n              the cultural norms of the day (10:38-42). <br>\n            </p>\n            <p>And only Luke describes Jesus' itinerant ministry as being funded \n              in part by the contributions of several well-to-do women who traveled \n              with him (8:1-3). </p>\n          </blockquote>\n          <p> 3. The Poor. </p>\n          <blockquote>\n            <p>In Matthew, Jesus blesses \"the poor in spirit,\" in Luke \n              he blesses \"you who are poor\" (6:20). <br>\n            </p>\n            <p>Jesus was anointed by God \"to preach good news to the poor\" \n              (Luke 4:18). <br>\n            </p>\n            <p>The various teachings in 14:7-24 all demonstrate God's concern \n              for the sick and dispossessed who are unable to help themselves \n              or return favors. <br>\n            </p>\n            <p>The parable of the rich man and Lazarus vindicates the poor beggar \n              at the expense of his counterpart wallowing in luxury (16:19-31). \n            </p>\n          </blockquote>\n          <p>4. Tax collectors and sinners (5:30, 7:34, and 15:1).</p>\n          <blockquote>\n            <p>Not only does Luke use the phrase, \"tax collectors and sinners,\" \n              to characterize those who gathered around Jesus to hear him and \n              were welcomed by him, but Luke alone tells two stories in which \n              tax collectors were heroes - the parable of the Pharisee and the \n              publican (18:9-14) and the conversion of Zaccheus (19:1-10).</p>\n          </blockquote>\n        </blockquote>\n      </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Christian Principles Unit 3: Inductive Study Workshop 2 - Epistle Paragraph Study & Introduction to the Gospels","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu3_inductgosp.htm"}

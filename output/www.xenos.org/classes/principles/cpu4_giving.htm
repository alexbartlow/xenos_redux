The Bible describes this as a habit of\n  consistent, sacrificial financial giving to God's work. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>HERBERT KANE: \"The last part of the person to convert is the wallet.\" How\n  true we've seen this to be! Therefore, we need to form deep biblical convictions about\n  this area as soon as possible in our Christian lives. </p>\n  <p>Remember the connection between our perspective on material things and spiritual \n    things.</p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><small>Matt. 6:21 \"...for where your treasure is, there will your \n      heart be also.\"</small></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The main text for tonight's study is 2 Corinthians 8 and 9. The historical setting had\n  Paul taking up a collection for the Jerusalem church (1 Cor. 16:1-3). It was most likely\n  for famine relief. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    \n    <p><b>(1 Cor. 16:1-3)</b> Now concerning \n      the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so \n      do you also. {2} On the first day of every week let each one of you put \n      aside and save, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come. \n      {3} And when I arrive, whomever you may approve, I shall send them with \n      letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem; </p>\n    <p>The Corinthians had evidently pledged a certain\n    amount to this (2 Cor 8:10). . . </p>\n    <p><b>(2 Cor. 8:10)</b> And I give my \n      opinion in this matter, for this is to your advantage, who were the first \n      to begin a year ago not only to do this, but also to desire to do it.</p>\n    <p>. . . but now they were not coming through on their commitment. This is one more\n    symptom of the carnality that had plagued the Corinthian church. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Therefore, Paul writes this reminder which is designed to motivate them to give. This\n    passage contains many important principles of giving for the Christian.

This is the \n      foundational motivation for <i>all </i>forms of Christian giving (e.g. O.T. \n      Thank-Offering &gt;&gt; Rom. 12:1 &gt;&gt; Phil.&#xA0;4:18). This is probably \n      why Paul \"bookends\" the imperitives of the section from 2 Cor. \n      8:1 through 9:15 with grace. </p>\n  </dir>\n</dir>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <p><b>(Rom. 12:1)</b> I urge you therefore, brethren, by the \n      mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable \n      to God, which is your spiritual service of worship. </p>\n     </blockquote>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><b>(Phil. 4:18)</b> But I have received everything in full, \n      and have an abundance; I am amply supplied, having received from Epaphroditus \n      what you have sent, a fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing \n      to God. </p>\n    \n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<dir>\n  <p><strong>Attitudes toward giving under grace vs. under law </strong></p>\n</dir>\n\n<blockquote>\n  \n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><b>Under law:</b> \"I give <em>in order to be</em><i> </i>accepted by God.\"\n    This motive is characteristic of other religions. They usually make giving one of the good\n    works by which we earn God's acceptance (ISLAM: alms as one of 5 PILLARS; CATHOLIC\n    INDULGENCES IN THE MEDIEVAL CHURCH; MASSES FOR THE DEAD TODAY). In other words, we give in\n    order to be accepted by God. <br>\n      <br>\n      INDULGENCES in the medieval Catholic church...</p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Medieval people had a very real dread of the period of \n        punishment they faced in purgatory... The church taught that before they \n        reached heaven they had to be cleansed of every sin committed in mortal \n        life and they feared purgatory's pains. Indulgences were a way of shortening \n        the punishment in purgatory.</p>\n      <p>Luther and others charged that indulgences turned men \n        away from God's forgiveness.</p>\n      <p>John Hus and others (e.g. John of Wesel) were persecuted \n        (in Hus' case, burnt at the stake) for opposing the sale of indulgences \n        and other unbiblical practices.</p>\n       </blockquote>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>In other words, we give in order to be accepted by God. \n        </p>\n      \n    </blockquote>\n    <p><br>\n    <b>Under grace:</b> We give <em>because</em><i> </i>we have been accepted by God. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  \n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><b>Under law:</b> \"My giving is a duty which I resent.\" This is the natural\n    consequence of a works-righteousness mentality. <br>\n    <br>\n    <b>Under grace:</b> \"My giving is a privilege which I enjoy.\" </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  \n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><b>Under law:</b> \"I give the least I can to keep God and others off \n      my back.\" Stinginess always flows from law-living. Warning signs include \n      hearing yourself ask AND focus on, \"What's the <strong>right</strong> \n      amount to give?\" \"I don't want to be irresponsible toward my obligations \n      to the family!\"&#xA0; C.S.

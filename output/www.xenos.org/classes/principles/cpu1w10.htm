As a rule, liberal (and some \n    neo-orthodox) theologians also deny Christ's deity. Fundamentalists, reacting \n    against this heresy, sometimes underemphasize his humanity. </p>\n  <p><strong>The so-called \"quest for \n    the historical Jesus\" was an attempt by liberal theologians to discover \n    what Jesus was actually like.</strong> Because of their <i>a priori</i> rejection \n    of miracles, the expectation of their inquiry was that the real Jesus would \n    prove to be different than the Jesus portrayed in scripture: </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><strong>(Millard Erickson)</strong>\" \n      . . . the earthly Jesus was depicted as basically a good man, a teacher \n      of great spiritual truths, but not the miracle-working, preexistent Second \n      Person of the Trinity.\" (Erickson, Millard,<i>Christian Theology </i>[Grand \n      Rapids: Baker Book House, 1985], p. 663.) </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p>Attempts to separate the Jesus of history \n    from the miracle-working so-called Christ of faith proved futile. </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Different scholars arrive at wildly \n      different conclusions about what Jesus was like. There aren't objective \n      criteria for distinguishing the \"real\" Jesus from the biblical \n      accounts of him.</li>\n    <li>Once you take away the miraculous, \n      the deity claims, the sayings that are attributed to the early church, there's \n      hardly anything left. The Jesus Seminar claims that only 20% of the recorded \n      sayings of Jesus are authentic, and an even lower percentage of the recorded \n      deeds. </li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Incarnation: The \n  point in history when the second person of the Trinity entered the human race.</strong> \n  The word literally means \"enfleshment.\"</p>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Definition: </strong></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><strong>At the Incarnation two natures \n      (full deity and full humanity), were inseparably united in the one person \n      of Jesus Christ.</strong> Whereas the Trinity involves three Persons who \n      share the same nature, the hypostatic union involves one Person who has \n      two natures. </p>\n    <p><strong>Col. 2:9* clearly teaches \n      this doctrine.</strong> Against Gnostic false teachers who denied Jesus' \n      deity and (probably) fleshly body, Paul insists that \"in him dwells \n      the fullness of deity in bodily form.\" </p>\n    <blockquote>  \n      <p><b>(Col. 2:9*)</b> For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily \n        form . . .</p>\n       </blockquote>\n    <p><strong>Jn. 1:1,14 also affirm the \n      hypostatic union. </strong>The Word \"was\" is in the imperfect \n      tense which might be translated \"always was\" God (vs 1). Verse \n      1 stresses the eternality, distinct personality and deity of the Word. In \n      verse 14 the emphasis is on a point in time event: \"became\" flesh \n      (vs 14). </p>\n    <blockquote>  \n      <p><b>(John 1:1,14)</b> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was \n        with God, and the Word was God&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.

(5) Therefore, when Christ came into the \n        world, he said: \"Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a \n        body you prepared for me; (6) with burnt offerings and sin offerings you \n        were not pleased.

Instead, it emphasizes his sinlessness, because <strong>Jesus \n      had to be morally blameless in order to be able to die for others</strong> \n      (Heb. 7:26-28; 9:14). </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <b> \n  </b><p>Could Jesus fall to temptation?</p>\n   \n  <blockquote> \n    <p><strong>Reformed syllogism:</strong> \n      God can't be tempted (Jas 1:13). Jesus is God (Col 2:9). Therefore, Jesus \n      could not sin (impeccability). </p>\n    <p><strong>However, Jesus was also human \n      and humans can be tempted.</strong> <strong> Jesus was tempted </strong>(Mt. \n      4)<strong> like we are</strong> (Heb 2:18; 4:15,16). These biblical accounts \n      that he successfully overcame temptation and that we can go to him for help \n      in overcoming temptation strongly imply that these temptations were real \n      in the sense that Jesus could have fallen to them.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <b> \n  </b><p>Did Jesus have a sin nature? </p>\n   \n  <blockquote> \n    <p><strong>Scripture</strong> does not \n      answer this question directly. However, it <strong>infers that Jesus did \n      not have a sin-nature</strong>. </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p><strong>In Rom. 8:3, Paul stops \n        short of affirming that Jesus had \"sinful flesh\"</strong>&#x97;he \n        says Jesus \"came in the likeness of sinful flesh.\" </p>\n      <p><strong>Rom. 5:12-19 provides two \n        important reasons why Jesus did not inherit the full effects of Adam.</strong></p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p><strong>First:</strong> He is \n          the \"second Adam\" (vs 14). This would suggest that, like Adam \n          before the Fall, Jesus made his choice to obey God without a sin-nature. \n          </p>\n        <p><strong>Second:</strong> Vs 16,18 \n          also say that those \"in Adam\" are born under condemnation&#x97;which \n          clearly was not the case with Jesus (Matt. 3:17). </p>\n      </blockquote>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><strong>\"Then Jesus didn't agonize \n      as much as we do!\"</strong> Only those who successfully resist temptation \n      feel its full weight. And a lot more was at stake for Jesus (the salvation \n      of humanity), and he undoubtedly experienced a greater frequency and degree \n      of temptation than we do. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Full Deity: </strong>Jn. 8:58; \n    l0:30; 14:9; Heb. l:8-10**; Rom. 9:5; Jn 1:1; Col 2:9 </p>\n  <p><strong>Biblical Case For Jesus' Deity \n    </strong></p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><b>Jesus' claims and the response to Jesus' claims</b></li>\n  </ul>\n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote>  \n      <p><b>Claim: (John 5:17)</b> But He answered them, \"My Father is working \n        until now, and I Myself am working.\"</p>\n      <p><b>Response:</b> <b>(John 5:18)</b> For this cause therefore the Jews \n        were seeking all the more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking \n        the Sabbath, but also was calling God His own Father, making Himself equal \n        with God.</p>\n      <p><b>Claim: (John&#xA0;8:58)</b> Jesus said to them, \"Truly, truly, \n        I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am.\"</p>\n      <p><b>Response:</b> <b>(John 8:59)</b> Therefore they picked up stones to \n        throw at Him; but Jesus hid Himself, and went out of the temple.</p>\n      <p><b>Claim: (John 10:30)</b> \"I and the Father are one.\"</p>\n      <p><b>Response:</b> <b>(John 10:31)</b> The Jews took up stones again to \n        stone Him.</p>\n       \n      <p>In the above passages, Jesus \n        makes these claims to a strictly monotheistic audience. They would understand \n        him to be claiming to be the one true God, not just saying that he was \n        God in some sense that we all are (like pantheists might).

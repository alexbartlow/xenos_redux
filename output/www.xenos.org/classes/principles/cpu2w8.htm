Yet, in spite of him indwelling us, his love for us, and \n    his ability to empower our sanctification and ministry, many Christians continue \n    to experience an absence of his power working in their lives. If he is all-loving \n    and powerful, why don't we always see constant improvement in our condition? \n    The New Testament also makes it clear that we have a choice and role to play \n    in whether or not we allow the Holy Spirit to do what he so deeply desires.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong><a name=\"a1\"></a><a name=\"Walking%20by%20the%20Spirit%20involves%20three%20things\">Walking \n  by the Spirit</a> </strong></h3>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Review Rom. 7:6, which describes two \n    ways we can serve God/pursue sanctification. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>\"In the oldness of the letter\"<i> \n    </i>(7:7-25)</p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>We can try to follow God by our own \n      power.

(6) For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the \n      mind set on the Spirit is life and peace, (7) because the mind set on the \n      flesh is hostile toward God; for it does not subject itself to the law of \n      God, for it is not even able to do so&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;</p>\n     \n    <p>According to Paul, the primary element \n      in walking according to the Spirit is \"setting our minds on the things \n      of the Spirit.\" </p>\n    <p>Definition: Volitional reflection \n      on the truths <em> concerning what God has freely given us</em> through \n      Christ. </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>As we learn to set our mind on \n        what God wants it set on, the power of the Holy Spirit is unleashed to \n        gradually transform our characters and behavior (\"the requirement \n        of the law fulfilled&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;life\") and also grant \n        us increasing experience of God's peace.</p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>God wants us to introspect regarding \n          what we think about and the perspective from which we view the different \n          facets of our life (remember Martyn Lloyd Jones' quote from week 3 about \n          talking to ourselves versus listening to ourselves). \n          Spiritual growth begins not with our behavior (what we do) or with our \n          experiences (what we feel)--but with our minds (how we think). That's \n          why he says in Romans 12:2 on this subject of transformation: (read)--behavioral \n          and experiential transformation flow from mental renewal!!</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p>What are the \"things of the \n        Spirit\" that we should be setting our minds on? </p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>Some Christian preachers say \n          the \"things of the Spirit\" refer to messages given to us through \n          heavenly voices or visions or dreams. This is not what Paul means. He \n          wants us to focus on truths that have been revealed through the apostles \n          and recorded in their writings, specifically on grace. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n    </blockquote>\n    In other words, the \"things of \n    the Spirit\" refer primarily to the New Testament teaching on God's grace. \n    That's why Paul calls this serving God \"under grace\" (6:14). </blockquote>\n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <p>\"Setting your mind on the \n        things of the Spirit\" is choosing to look at every major area of \n        your life in the light of God's grace. The more we learn about what Christ \n        has given us, and the more we consciously view every area of our lives \n        from his perspective, the more God's Spirit will transform our lives. \n        (See also Col. 3:1-3).</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <blockquote>  \n      <p>(1 Cor. 2:12-13) Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but \n        the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things freely given \n        to us by God, (13) which things we also speak, not in words taught by \n        human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts \n        with spiritual words. (14) But a natural man does not accept the things \n        of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand \n        them, because they are spiritually appraised. </p>\n       \n      <p>(Col. 3:1-3) If then you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking \n        the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. (2) \n        Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth. \n        (3) For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God. </p>\n       \n      <p>(Eph. 4:20-25) <small>20 But you did not learn \n        Christ in this way, 21 if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught \n        in Him, just as truth is in Jesus,<br>\n        22 that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the \n        old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, \n        23 and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, 24 and put on the \n        new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness \n        and holiness of the truth. 25 Therefore, laying aside falsehood, SPEAK \n        TRUTH, EACH ONE of you, WITH HIS NEIGHBOR, for we are members of one another.</small></p>\n      <p>Paul contrasts this mind-set to \n        a mind-set on the \"things of the flesh.\" This refers to the \n        perspective we adopt on things apart from and contradictory to God's revealed \n        grace. This is our mental \"default setting\"--which is why we \n        must choose to \"set our minds on\" God's perspective.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Note: This is why we emphasize biblical \n      content (and especially what it teaches about God's grace) so much: going \n      to Bible studies, taking courses, discussing scripture with one another, \n      evaluating your thought-life and the messages coming at you from the world \n      in light of what God says (2 Cor. 10:3-5). And this is why we emphasize \n      New Testament more than Old Testament--because it teaches God's grace more \n      clearly and fully.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Key mind-set areas</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Let's get practical.

We are grateful to receive love from them -- but \n          we don&#x92;t have to demand it because we know God will be there. In \n          fact, we see their love ultimately as an expression of God's love for \n          us. </p>\n        <p>When they hurt us, we can extend \n          forgiveness--because we're so aware and appreciative of how much God \n          has forgiven us. More importantly, we begin to be able to give love \n          to others sacrificially and without strings--because we are secure in \n          God's love, and because we experience the joy of God when we do so. \n          This other-centered perspective is both a result of spiritual growth \n          and a cause of further growth. </p>\n         \n        <p>(Gal. 5:26-6:4) Let us not become boastful, challenging one another, \n          envying one another.

The seeds we sow to the Spirit \n        that produce this harvest are&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;a disciplined \n        use of the means of grace. That is, daily prayer and meditation on the \n        Scriptures,&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;reading Christian books, making \n        Christian friends, and getting engaged in Christian service. It is by \n        a disciplined use of these means of grace that we grow in grace, and the \n        Holy Spirit within us is able to produce the beauty of holiness.\" \n        (John R.W.

You can see \n            that Paul includes this in \"sowing to the Spirit,\" because \n            after enunciating this principle in Gal. 6:7-9, he says 6:10 (read). \n            We should do good to all people--not just Christians, but also those \n            who don&#x92;t know Christ. As we give ourselves away in love to serve \n            others for Christ's sake, the Holy Spirit vitalizes us spiritually \n            and gradually transforms our lives.

It's a lot like learning to ride a bike which \n      is difficult because you have to simultaneously do three things: balance, \n      steer, and pedal. Similarly, walking by the Spirit involves the three things \n      described above. With practice, this becomes easier and more natural--though \n      never as natural as riding a bike because there is the consistent opposition \n      of the flesh and Satan.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong><a name=\"The%20Filling%20of%20the%20Holy%20Spirit\">The \n  Filling of the Holy Spirit</a></strong></h3>\n<dir> \n  <p>The term \"filled\" (Greek: \n    <i>pleroo</i>) means to be \"characterized by.\" To be filled with \n    the Holy Spirit means to be characterized by the Holy Spirit. In the following \n    passages, several truths concerning the filling of the Spirit emerge. </p>\n</dir>\n<blockquote> \n  <ol>\n    <li>Whereas Christians receive the baptism \n      by the Spirit only once (1 Cor 12:13*), it is possible for us to receive \n      repeated \"in-fillings.\" This was the case with the early church, \n      and Luke is careful to note that this was the key to their vitality and \n      effectiveness in evangelism (see Acts 1:8; 2:4; 4:8,31; 6:3,5; 7:55; 9:17; \n      13:9,52). </li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <ol start=\"2\">\n    <li>The \"filling of the Spirit\" \n      is connected with our free will. An individual Christian can choose to be \n      or not to be filled. </li>\n  </ol>\n  <blockquote>  \n    <p>(Eph. 5:18) And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but \n      be filled with the Spirit,</p>\n     </blockquote>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>\"Be filled with\" is present \n      (continuous) tense, imperative mood, and passive voice. Therefore, it is \n      helpful to consider the filling of the Holy Spirit as the result of a Christian's \n      openness to the Spirit's influence. Note the qualities of being filled described \n      in vv. 19 &amp; 20 cf. Col. 3:16</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <ol start=\"3\">\n    <li>In Paul's letters, the term \"filled \n      with the Spirit\" (Eph. 5:18) is synonymous with the terms \"walking \n      by/according to the Spirit\" (see Rom. 8:4-ll; Gal. 5:l6,l8,25). All \n      of these terms emphasize our volition in availing ourselves to the Holy \n      Spirit, and they describe similar results of spiritual vitality.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <ol start=\"4\">\n    <li>\"Grieving the Holy Spirit\" \n      (Eph. 4:30) and \"quenching the Spirit\" (1 Thes. 5:19) apparently \n      refer to two different ways in which Christians resist the filling of the \n      Holy Spirit in their lives. In a sense, then, they refer to the opposite \n      of being filled with the Spirit. </li>\n  </ol>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Although \"grieving the Spirit\" \n      is not clearly defined, the context (Eph. 4:25-32) makes it clear that it \n      involves willfully disregarding the Holy Spirit's <i>moral</i> guidance. \n      </li>\n  </ul>\n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote>  \n      <p>(Eph. 4:29-31) Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only \n        such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment, \n        that it may give grace to those who hear. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit \n        of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Let all bitterness \n        and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along \n        with all malice.</p>\n       </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <p>This is not just whenever you sin, \n        because the Holy Spirit works personally according to his priorities. \n        But when he has put his finger on an area and you say \"No, not now,\" \n        you are hardening your heart and you may wind up wandering around in a \n        spiritual wilderness. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\"Quenching the Spirit\" \n      is also not clearly defined, but the context (1 Thess. 5:20-22) indicates \n      that it involves disregarding the Holy Spirit's efforts to direct and edify \n      the church through various gifted members. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <blockquote>\n    <blockquote>  \n      <p>(1 Thess. 5:19-21) Do not quench the Spirit; do not despise prophetic \n        utterances. But examine everything carefully; hold fast to that which \n        is good and abstain from every form of evil.</p>\n       </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Quenching the Spirit can include \n        such things as promoting a clergy/laity separation in the church rather \n        than diligently equipping &amp; deploying gifted members. We strongly \n        encourage and make time for sharing in meetings and extemporaneous prayer \n        to provide opportunities for people moved by the Spirit to speak up.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Memory Verses </strong></h3>\n<dir> \n  <p>Romans 8:4-14** - extended passage \n    on walking according to the Spirit </p>\n  <p>Galatians 5:16-25** - extended passage \n    on walking according to the Spirit </p>\n  <p>Acts 2:42* - consistent participation \n    in the Word, prayer and fellowship were keys to their spiritual vitality </p>\n</dir>\n<h3>Assignment</h3>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>As we learned last week, Christians normally receive the Holy Spirit when \n    they believe in the gospel (Eph.&#xA0;1:13,14). The ability to speak in tongues, \n    however, is normally a spiritual gift given only to some Christians (1&#xA0;Cor.&#xA0;12:30), \n    and is therefore not required for salvation or spiritual growth.</p>\n  <p>Some Christian groups, however, teach that there is normally a delay between \n    believing in the gospel and receiving the Holy Spirit, and that the gift of \n    the Holy Spirit is normally manifested by speaking in tongues. Such groups \n    appeal to four passages in Acts (listed below) as scriptural support for these \n    claims.

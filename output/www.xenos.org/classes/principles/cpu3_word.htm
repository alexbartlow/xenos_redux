Theologians call their act of \n        disobedience \"the Fall\" because it marks the introduction of \n        sin into the human race. Two main consequences resulted from the Fall: \n        <p><b>Separation from God</b><br>\n          Think of how painful it would have been, after being in regular close \n          contact with God, to be driven out of the Garden. To ensure they would \n          never return and to keep them from finding the tree of life, God posted \n          an angel to guard the entrance to the garden. They were not allowed \n          to return to God's presence.</p>\n        <p><b>Lost dominion</b><br>\n          When Adam and Eve rebelled against God, they rejected his offer to rule \n          with him over creation, and chose instead to live under the rule of \n          God's enemy, Satan. As a result, the whole world, according to John, \n          \"lies in the power of the evil one.\" In Ephesians 2 we're \n          described as Satan's subjects: before we knew Christ we walked \"according \n          to the Prince of the Power of the Air.\" </p>\n        <p><b>God's recovery plan</b><br>\n          Any good story starts out with a problem that needs to be resolved. \n          The Bible is no different: separation from God and lost dominion - these \n          are the problems that frame the rest of the biblical story. They are \n          deep problems that mankind will not be able to fix without outside help. \n          God will need to intervene with a rescue plan.</p>\n        <p>Our first hint at God's response to these problems comes immediately \n          after the Fall. After the serpent deceives Eve, God curses him (read \n          Genesis 3:15). Just as a good story teller uses foreshadowing to give \n          readers clues about what lies ahead, in Genesis 3:15 we see a hint of \n          how God will begin to address the problems caused by the Fall. Eve's \n          seed will crush the serpent on the head (pointing to the decisive death \n          blow that Christ would deal Satan on the cross) and the serpent will \n          bruise Eve's seed on the heel (referring to the horrible cost Christ \n          incurred in dealing that death blow - crucifixion). </p>\n        <p>From the very beginning, God has a rescue plan, but as the plot continues, \n          things go from bad to worse. In Genesis 4 we read that Adam and Eve's \n          son Cain kills his brother Abel. By Genesis 6, the author notes that \n          \"Every intent of the thoughts of man's heart was only evil continually.\"</p>\n        <p>Things were so bad that God wiped out the human race in a flood and \n          started fresh with Noah. But more problems develop. Noah's descendants \n          become so prideful and audacious that they build a tower to reach the \n          heavens in order to make a name for themselves - a direct affront to \n          God. And so, as Genesis unfolds, we're exposed to the tenacious problem \n          of human rebellion and it's destructive effects. The problems that began \n          the story have only deepened.</p>\n      </td>\n    </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Christian Principles Unit 3: The Word as a Means of Growth & Introduction to Inspiration","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu3_word.htm"}

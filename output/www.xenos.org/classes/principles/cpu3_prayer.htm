He has our best interests \n      in mind. </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>Romans 8:28 And we know that God causes all things to work together for \n        good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Let's examine some of the scriptural reasons for ungranted requests.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><strong>1. Our request was not according to God's will. </strong>(God always \n    answers. But sometimes his answer is \"No.\") </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>(Matt. 6:10) \"&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;your will be done, your kingdom \n      come&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;\"</p>\n    <p>(Matt.&#xA0;26:39b) \"&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;not my will but yours \n      be done&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;\" </p>\n    <p>\"Prayer is not a convenient device for imposing our will on God, or \n      for bending his will to ours, but the prescribed way of subordinating our \n      will to his. It is by prayer that we seek God's will, embrace it, and align \n      ourselves with it. Every true prayer is a variation on the theme `your will \n      be done.'\" (John R. W. Stott, <i>Tyndale New Testament Commentaries: \n      The Epistles of John</i> (Downers Grove: InterVarsity, 1983), p.&#xA0;185.)</p>\n    <p>We can be confident that God will grant our requests <i>only</i> when our \n      requests are according to his will (1&#xA0;Jn.&#xA0;5:14,15*). We are free \n      to ask for whatever we wish, but unless scripture explicitly states that \n      our request is God's will, we cannot be confident that God will answer the \n      affirmative. </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>(1&#xA0;Jn. &#xA0;5:14,15*) This is the confidence we have in approaching \n        God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. (15) \n        And if we know that he hears us&#x97;whatever we ask&#x97;we know that \n        we have what we asked of him. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>To pray in Jesus' name is not a magical incantation that makes God grant \n      our request. It means to pray as Jesus' representative (GOVERNMENT AGENT \n      REQUISITIONING SUPPLIES). In Jn 15:7, He makes this very clear. </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>(John 14:13,14) And whatever you ask in My name, that will I do, that \n        the Father may be glorified in the Son. (14) If you ask Me anything in \n        My name, I will do it.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>A child who knows his father is both powerful and loving will feel the \n      freedom to ask for anything&#x97;but he will trust that his father will \n      answer in the best way &#x97; including \"NO.\" Note that the context \n      before and after this passage is loving others.</p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>(Matt. 7:7-11) Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and you shall \n        find; knock, and it shall be opened to you. (8) For everyone who asks \n        receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it shall be opened. \n        (9) Or what man is there among you, when his son shall ask him for a loaf, \n        will give him a stone? (10) Or if he shall ask for a fish, he will not \n        give him a snake, will he? (11) If you then, being evil, know how to give \n        good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father who is in \n        heaven give what is good to those who ask Him!</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>This is the problem with positive confessionalism (name it, claim it). \n      It teaches that what matters is the amount of one's faith. Therefore God's \n      denial of a prayer request indicates unfaithfulness in the petitioner. Realize \n      that this is another form of magic because it tries to manipulate God to \n      do our will, and is not grounded in trust in his goodness and commitment \n      to his will. </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Are we to conclude Paul lacked faith? In 2 Cor. 12:8,9 Paul asks the \n        Lord to heal him and is refused.</p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>(2 Cor. 12:8, 9) Concerning this I entreated the Lord three times that \n          it might depart from me. (9) And He has said to me, \"My grace is \n          sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.\" Most gladly, \n          therefore, I will rather boast about my weaknesses, that the power of \n          Christ may dwell in me.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Therefore, in our prayers, we should focus on issues about which we know \n      God's will. When we turn to the Bible, it gives us quite a lot of knowledge \n      of God's will in many areas of life. There are specific promises that God \n      makes to all believers. There are direct statements of his will for our \n      lives. There are inspired examples of what the biblical authors prayed for. \n      These are the things that should become the focus of our prayer lives. </p>\n    <p><b>Biblical Prayer Priorities:</b></p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>\"Most of us&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;get bogged with down with \n        trivia: Jane's sinus trouble, Ben's discouragement, Mary's problem with \n        her mother-in-law&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0; All of these may be important, \n        but prayer, like warfare, calls for strategy. It is said of Napoleon that \n        he would watch the development of his battles from a vantage, quietly \n        analyzing the situation while he watched. His key general would watch \n        with him. 'That farm,' he once said to Marshall Ney, 'that farm that you \n        can see on the ridge there. Take it. Seize. Hold it. For if you can, the \n        battle is won.' In praying for the Ephesians, Paul was aware that if the \n        key to the whole battle was won, lesser skirmishes would sort themselves \n        out rather easily. Smaller problems are so often symptomatic of larger \n        issues&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;Prayer must be directed to that which \n        is the key. It concerns itself with strategy, not with tactics&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;If \n        therefore one thinks that Paul's prayer is spiritual and not practical, \n        it is a sign of how blind he is to what life is all about&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;\"&#xA0; \n        (John White, <i>Daring To Draw Near</i> (Downers Grove: InterVarsity Press, \n        1977), p. 137.)</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <ul>\n      <li>More practical insight into scripture so that you can apply it to your \n        life (Col. 1:9,10). </li>\n      <li>Better understanding of what God has given you in Christ (Eph.&#xA0;1:16-19) \n        and how much God loves you (Eph. 3:18,19). </li>\n      <li>Greater love for other people (1 Thes. 3:12) and better discernment \n        on how to love them effectively (Phil.&#xA0;1:9). </li>\n      <li>Opportunities for witness and the courage and wisdom to make the most \n        of those opportunities (Col. 4:2-4*; Eph. 6:19,20).</li>\n      <li>Spiritual empowering and protection for ministry (2&#xA0;Thes. 2:16-3:3). \n      </li>\n      <li>Exposure of attitudes that are counterproductive to your spiritual growth \n        (Phil.&#xA0;3:15; Ps.&#xA0;139:23,24).</li>\n      <li>Wisdom to understand what God wants to teach you through adverse circumstances \n        that are in your life (Jas.&#xA0;1:5).</li>\n      <li>That God may raise up more workers (Matt. 9:36-38).</li>\n    </ul>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Recommend: D. A. Carson, \"Spiritual Reformation: Priorities from \n        Paul and His Prayers\"</p>\n      <p>Note: Of course, these are the very same things that we should be praying \n        for other people as well! </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><strong>2. The request was answered, but not according to our expectations.</strong></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Especially if we don't know God's Word very well, we may be surprised when \n      he answers biblical requests in ways we had not anticipated. </p>\n    <p>Examples: </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Sometimes we pray for symptom issues, and then God answers by revealing \n        and working on more root issues (WE FIND THAT OUR ANGRY OUTBURSTS ARE \n        REALLY THE RESULT OF TAKING OUR ACCEPTANCE AND SIGNIFICANCE FROM PEOPLE'S \n        VIEW OF US). </p>\n      <p>Sometimes we pray for good root issues, but don't realize that God often \n        deals with them by engineering breaking (PAUL IN 2&#xA0;COR. 12: God granted \n        his request for power in ministry by giving him a thorn in the flesh). \n      </p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>(2 Cor. 12:7-9) To keep me from becoming conceited because of these \n          surpassingly great revelations, there was given me a thorn in my flesh, \n          a messenger of Satan, to torment me. (8) Three times I pleaded with \n          the Lord to take it away from me. (9) But he said to me, \"My grace \n          is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.\" \n          Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that \n          Christ's power may rest on me.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><strong>3. God's timing for answering our request is different than ours.</strong></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Especially in our \"instant gratification\" culture, we expect \n      quick answers to our requests. We tend to equate value with something's \n      ability to bring quick and powerful results. But God's perspective is very \n      different from ours. He is working from the perspective of eternity, and \n      he is concerned with quality. \"If God wants to make a squash, he takes \n      three months; if he wants to create an oak tree, he takes a lifetime.\" \n      He knows when we are ready for the good things that we ask for&#x97;and \n      we need to trust him. </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Examples: marriage (CHARACTER TRANSFORMATION NEEDED); having children \n        (SAME); more ministry responsibility </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Praying for instant deliverance from sin-problems sounds appealing, but \n      God usually works a slow transformation that lasts.</p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>[(Packer) \". . . The Spirit works through means - the means of Growth \n        . . . The Spirit shows his power in us, not by constantly interrupting \n        our use of these means with visions, impressions, or prophecies, which \n        serve up to us ready-made insights on a plate . . . but rather by making \n        these regular means effective to change us for the better and the wiser \n        as we go along . . .\"]</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>This is one reason why we need to be persistent in prayer. See Lk.&#xA0;11:5-13; \n      18:1-8.</p>\n    <p>The point is not that God is like the judge or neighbor. Rather he is unlike \n      them in key ways. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Christian Principles Unit 3: Prayer as a Means of Growth","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu3_prayer.htm"}

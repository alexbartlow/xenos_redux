Appropriation \n      consists of three sequential steps, which Paul outlines in ROM 6. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Read Vs 6*. \"knowing \n      this, that our old self was crucified with Him, that our body of sin might \n      be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin;\"</p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>This means learning what the Bible \n        teaches about our new identity, and regularly remembering/reflecting<i> \n        </i>on it (2 Pet. 1:12,13,15). </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Explain the terminology (refer to \n      footnote in student notes instead of covering in class)</p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>\"Your old self was crucified \n        with Christ . . . \" Our old identity (in Adam) has been completely \n        obliterated; it no longer exists. See also Jn. 3:3,5; Col. 3:3; 2 Cor. \n        5:17. </p>\n      <p>\" . . . so that your body \n        of sin may be done away with . . . \" \"Body of sin\" refers \n        not to your old identity, but to your <i>sin-nature</i>. \"Done away \n        with\" (<i>katargeo</i>) can mean this, but other passages clearly \n        teach that Christians still have a sin-nature (ROM 7:17). It should therefore \n        be translated here \"made powerless\" (NASB margin) or (better) \n        \"put out of authority\" (see ROM 7:2 - \" . . . she is <i>released \n        from </i>the law . . . \" </p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>Summary: Our old identity has \n          been destroyed, so that our sin nature has been put out of authority \n          over us. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p>\" . . . so that you may no \n        longer be slaves of sin.\" This is the desired behavioral result. \n        God has struck at the root of the problem rather than leaving us to deal \n        with it by our own willpower.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Illustration: The Emancipation Proclamation \n      became law of the land on Dec. 18, 1865. The legal identity of all slaves \n      instantly changed. Their old identity as property/slaves was \"killed.\" \n      They received a new legal identity as citizens. Why was this important? \n      Because this changed their relationship to their previous owners. Their \n      previous owners continued to exist, but their authority over them was now \n      removed, so that they were no longer legally obliged to live as slaves. \n      </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>How important was this knowledge? \n        Do you know that thousands of them continued to live out their lives as \n        slaves because their ex-masters successfully kept this information from \n        them? </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Many Christians (perhaps you) assume \n      that though they are forgiven for their sins, there is no basis for deep-seated \n      change in their lives. If we don't know that we have been freed from the \n      authority of our sin-nature, we will try to sanctify ourselves by the flesh, \n      leading either to self-righteous self-deception, or fatalistic honesty about \n      our sins. </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Therefore, we need to study this \n        truth until we understand it, ask God to illuminate it so we see its significance \n        in our lives, meditate on it, remind ourselves of it, etc. Read and reread \n        books about it. Remember Romans 12:2- \"...transformed by the renewing \n        of your minds.\"</p>\n      <p>We must also ground young Christians \n        in this truth as soon as possible so that they can begin to challenge \n        their view of their identity and replace it with God's.&#xA0; This needs \n        to be a key and ongoing aspect to our discipling relationships. We also \n        need to pray that God will give us his view on the people around us.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Read ROM 6:11* <small>Even \n      so consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.</small></p>\n    <p>Choosing to affirm what God says \n      about your identity in spite of all the contrary feelings, thoughts, past \n      behavioral evidence, other people, etc. say about you, in the specific identity \n      area that fuels the expressed sin.</p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>EG. \"I feel unappreciated.\" \n        But God's view would contradict this feeling. Which are you going to choose \n        to believe? What your feelings are telling you or what you \"know\" \n        is true?</p>\n      <p>The word here (<i>logizomai</i>) \n        is an accounting term&#x97;often refers to making an accurate ledger entry.&#xA0; \n        You enter an amount into the ledger because it has been deposited, <i>not</i> \n        that you enter the amount so that it will be deposited (contra CHRISTIAN \n        SCIENCE &amp; POSTMODERNISM: my beliefs don't create reality; they should \n        conform to reality).  </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Illustration: Let's assume that you \n      have never had more than $150 in your checking account. Suddenly, a trusted \n      friend informs you that he has deposited $100,000 into your account. You \n      check with the bank and ascertain that this is indeed the case. How important \n      is it that you enter that amount in your check ledger, and believe that \n      entry? What if you listened instead to your feelings or your family members \n      who keep telling you that you only have $150? If you want to reap the benefit \n      of the $100,000, you have to choose to believe the actual amount! Otherwise, \n      you could go on living as though you were poor! </p>\n    <p>This means monitoring our thought-lives, \n      becoming aware of lies about ourselves as they present themselves to us&#x97;and \n      choosing to replace those lies with what God says is true about us (2 Cor. \n      10:5). We should ask the Lord to sensitize us to these lies, and help us \n      to see how our new identity applies to us in specific areas. THIS IS THE \n      MISSING STEP FOR MANY CHRISTIANS! Often we need other mature Christians \n      to help us discern what these lies may be. </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>(D. M. Lloyd-Jones)&#xA0; \". \n        . .we must talk to ourselves instead of allowing 'ourselves' to talk to \n        us! Do you realize what that means? I suggest that the main trouble in \n        this whole matter of spiritual depression in a sense is this, that we \n        allow our self to talk to us instead of talking to our self. Am I just \n        trying to be deliberately paradoxical? Far from it. This is the very essence \n        of wisdom in this matter. Have you realized that most of your unhappiness \n        in life is due to the fact that you are listening to yourself instead \n        of talking to yourself? Take those thoughts that come to you the moment \n        you wake up in the morning. You have not originated them, but they start \n        talking to you, they bring back the problems of yesterday, etc. Somebody \n        is talking. Who is talking to you? Your self is talking to you. Now this \n        man's treatment was this; instead of allowing this self to talk to him, \n        he starts talking to himself. 'Why art thou cast down, O my soul?' he \n        asks. His soul had been depressing him, crushing him. So he stands up \n        and says: 'Self, listen for moment, I will speak to you'. Do you know \n        what I mean? If you do not, you have had but little experience.</p>\n      <p>The main art in the matter of spiritual \n        living is to know how to handle yourself. You have to take yourself in \n        hand, you have to address yourself, preach to yourself, question yourself. \n        You must say to your soul: 'Why are you cast down'&#x97;what business \n        have you to be disquieted? You must turn on yourself, upbraid yourself, \n        condemn yourself, exhort yourself, and say to yourself; 'Hope you in God'&#x97;instead \n        of muttering in this depressed unhappy way. And then you must go on to \n        remind yourself of God, Who God is, and what God is and what God has done \n        and what God has pledged Himself to do. Then having done that, end on \n        this great note: defy yourself, and defy other people, and defy the devil \n        and the whole world, and say with this man: 'I shall yet praise Him for \n        the help of His countenance, who is also the health of my countenance \n        and my God'.&#xA0; (D. M. \n        Lloyd-Jones, <i>Spiritual Depression: Its Causes and Cure </i>[Grand Rapids: \n        Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1982], pp. 20,21.) </p>\n      </blockquote>\n    <p>This is contrary to what many Christians \n      suffer from: either mental passivity (not challenging their thoughts) or \n      the therapeutic view of feelings (validating our feelings).&#xA0; Which \n      do you tend toward? The therapeutic view of feelings would insist that actions \n      proceeding from feelings are excusable (no matter how sinful), and therefore \n      the route to better actions is our bad feelings being corrected&#x97;often \n      we falsely believe this correction is the responsibility of others to cause. \n      </p>\n    <p>People cannot see how you monitor \n      your thought life, but this is at the heart of long-lasting change in the \n      Christian's life. People will see the behavioral and attitudinal changes \n      occur as you progress in your attention to your thoughts.</p>\n    <p>Emancipation Proclamation: How important \n      was it for those ex-slaves who knew about the Emancipation Proclamation \n      to choose to \"consider\" that they actually were free citizens? \n      How difficult was it for them to choose to \"consider\" this&#x97;especially \n      when their own thoughts and feelings, their ex-owners, said \"You're \n      nothing but a slave. You always have been a slave, and you always will be \n      a slave.\" </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Here is an even greater tragedy \n        than the suppression of the news: thousands of ex-slaves knew about the \n        Emancipation Proclamation, yet still lived out the rest of their lives \n        because they didn't choose to believe what was true of them and instead \n        chose to go on believing what their ex-owners and own conditioning told \n        them. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>How important is it for you as a \n      Christian to choose to believe that you are no longer a slave to sin? How \n      many of us continue to live as slaves, not because we don't know this truth, \n      but because we don't choose against our feelings and previous experience \n      to believe it? If we passively respond, our \"knowing\" will not \n      profit us. </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>This is why every day, we should \n        consciously recall and remind ourselves of what is true about us in this \n        area: \"I am free from sin's authority and therefore able to change.\" \n        </p>\n      <p>This is why especially when we \n        are confronted by evidence to the contrary through failure, accusation, \n        etc., it is so important to choose to reject that conclusion and instead \n        agree with God that \"he has set me free from sin's authority and \n        that his power is progressively changing my life as I continue to believe \n        what he says and cooperate with him.\" </p>\n      <p>It is also essential, when helping \n        Christians who are struggling in a sin area, to help them consider how \n        their new identity specifically applies to the area and what lies about \n        their identity they were believing.&#xA0; Not counseling in this manner \n        will lead to a legalistic approach to their change.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p> Read ROM 6: <small>13* and \n      do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin as instruments of \n      unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, \n      and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.</small></p>\n    <p>(Note: \"Walking in Victory\" \n      does not differentiate between \"consider\" and \"present\" \n      to the extent we will in the notes that follow.) </p>\n    <p>This means choosing to step out in \n      faith and act in ways that are consistent with your new identity. This is \n      the step that makes what we have learned \"living truth.\" </p>\n    <p>Emancipation Proclamation: Who were \n      the ex-slaves who actually experienced a life of increasing freedom? They \n      were the ones who knew about the Emancipation Proclamation, who chose to \n      consider it to be true in spite of the contrary input of their ex-masters, \n      their memories, etc.&#x97;and what else? Who actually began to refuse the \n      orders of their ex-masters <i>and</i> instead walked off the \"security\" \n      of the plantations and put themselves in places where the power of the government \n      supported their freedom (MOVED TO NORTHERN CITIES; FOUND PAYING EMPLOYERS). \n      It was this scary risk, based on the previous two steps, that resulted in \n      increasing experiential freedom for them. </p>\n    <p>Who are the Christians who experience \n      a life of increasing freedom from slavery to sin? </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>The ones who <i>know</i> Vs 6, \n        then<i> consider</i> it to be the truth about them in spite of what their \n        sin-natures, Satan, previous experiences and others tell them&#x97;and \n        finally, who on that basis choose not to submit to moral defeat in their \n        lives and instead <em>present</em> themselves to God in ways that allow \n        his power to change their lives. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Other Examples: </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>You are angry with a person for \n        not paying enough attention to you. The fact is that they ARE being unloving \n        and insensitive. At a teaching, you learn (<em>Know</em>) that God will \n        meet all of your love needs and that we should therefore not look to other \n        people to do this. Realizing that this is what you have been doing, you \n        choose to affirm that God will provide for you in this area (<em>Consider</em>). \n        Now what would it look like to <em>present</em> ourselves based on this \n        identity truth? (choose not to lash out or punish with silence, etc.; \n        instead choose to freely give to that person in some way; address their \n        insensitivity for their good). </p>\n      <p>You are depressed and resentful \n        because of how much more gifted in a certain area your friend is than \n        you are. As you study 1 Cor. 12, you realize that God has gifted you to \n        play a unique role in his Body (<em>Know</em>). You agree that the difference \n        between you and your friend in gifted areas is part of God's design rather \n        than you getting the short end of the stick (<em>Consider</em>). Now what \n        would it look like to <em>Present</em> ourselves on this identity truth? \n        (thank God for your friend's contribution; compliment, encourage, and \n        promote your friend's accomplishments in that area; thank God for what \n        he has shown that you can do for him, and look for opportunities to serve \n        in that area). </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\"Presenting\" usually involves \n      both a negative and positive step. </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>It is necessary to choose to <em>turn \n        away from</em> immoral habits (Vs 13a: \"do not go on presenting yourselves \n        to sin . . . \")</p>\n      <p>It is also necessary to <em>turn \n        to </em>God in ways that expose you to his alternative (Vs 13b: \" \n        . . . but present yourselves to God . . . \"). Real change involves \n        the willingness to say \"No!\" (e.g., STAYING OUT OF SEXUALLY \n        TEMPTING SITUATIONS)&#x97;but this is ultimately futile unless we also \n        say \"Yes!\" to the ways that expose us to God's life-changing \n        power. This is the \"Resist-Replace\" principle. </p>\n      <p>EXAMPLES: </p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>Sensuality: practically avoiding \n          tempting situations (Resist) + developing Christ-centered love relationships \n          (Replace)&#x97;see 1 Thess. 4:3-10; 2 Tim. 2:22 </p>\n      </blockquote>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Our New Identity in Christ","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu2w3.htm"}

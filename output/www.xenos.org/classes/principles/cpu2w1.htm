Therefore, we cannot \n    assume that every time we see the word \"sanctification\" used in \n    the Bible, that it always refers to spiritual growth. The author of Hebrews \n    uses this term, sanctification, to refer to what we here call \"justification\" \n    (see Heb. 10:10,14; 12:14). Paul uses the noun form (\"saints\") to \n    refer to all people who have been justified&#x97;not to an elite class of \n    super-mature Christians (see 1 Cor. 1:2). How would we determine the exact \n    meaning of the word?

This relationship develops in several \n    ways that we will discuss. As teachers, we are committed to helping you understand \n    the process of growth (Eph 4:11-15).

We will use this passage as our base \n    text. John elaborates on each of these aspects in 1 John. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu2w1.htm#A1\">Footnote1A</a><a name=\"a1f\"></a> \n    John was concerned to explain what Christian spirituality is in contrast to \n    the false spirituality espoused by the Gnostics. As he does this, it becomes \n    clear that he stresses three aspects of spirituality. They are woven throughout \n    the epistle. These areas are not airtight categories. They are all interrelated \n    and are pursued in the context of a personal relationship with God... </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><b>(John 15:7-14)</b> \n      \"If you abide in Me, and \n      My words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it shall be done for you. \n      (8) \"By this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit, and \n      so prove to be My disciples.

Psa. 32:8 was probably written after David \n        committed adultery. </p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p><strong>(Ps.32:8)</strong>&#xA0; \n          \"I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I \n          will counsel you and watch over you.

Persevere!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See, for example, John's emphasis in \n  1 John on doctrinal fidelity (2:24; 4:1-3;14,15), moral obedience (1:5-2:6) \n  and loving others (2:7-11; 4:7-21). John purposefully defines spirituality in \n  these terms in order to combat a Gnostic emphasis on subjective experience. \n  Paul's letters to Timothy and Titus likewise urge them to emphasize doctrinal \n  understanding (1 Tim. 1:3,4; 3:2,9; 4:6,13,15; 6:3,20; 2 Tim. 1:13,14; 2:8,15,24; \n  3:14-4:4; Titus 1:9,13,14; 2:1,2,7), moral character (1 Tim. 2:2; 3:2-12; 4:12; \n  6:11; 2 Tim. 2:3-6,19-22; 3:16; Titus 1:6-8; 2:2-10; 3:1,2), and love manifested \n  practically through good deeds (1 Tim. 1:5; 2:10,15; 3:4,12; 4:12; 5:10; 6:11,18; \n  2 Tim. 1:7; 2:22,24,25; 3:10; Titus 2:2,4,14; 3:8,14). Jesus' primary concerns \n  for the seven churches in Rev. 2,3 reveals the same three foci: pure doctrine \n  (2:2,6,13-15,20,24; 3:8), moral purity (2:14,20-22), and love (2:4,5,19). The \n  references to these three emphases from the other epistles are too numerous \n  to mention. </p>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Overview of Sanctification","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu2w1.htm"}

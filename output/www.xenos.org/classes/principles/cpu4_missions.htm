There are several thousand throughout the \n      Bible! </p>\n    <p><strong>Q2 -</strong> Why did JC come to earth? To save us? Yes, but that's \n      rather man-centered&#x85;what did Jesus get out of it?. Dying for our sins \n      was not the ultimate goal. Jn 17:4--glorify God. JC came to glorify the \n      Father. JC said \"as the father sent me, so send I you\"(Jn 20:21). \n      He came to glorify the Father and so should we. What does it mean to glorify \n      the Father? One way is to bring unity out of diversity. Think about an International \n      Bible study.This is like a picture of heaven. Bringing many diverse people \n      together in Him. </p>\n    <p><strong>Q3 -</strong> Ps 46:10 Fill in the blank: \"Be still and _____________\" \n      WHY did we only know the 1st half of this verse?

What is missions? </strong></p>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> The information in the next section is taken \n    directly from: Worldwide Perspectives: Understanding God's Purposes in the \n    World from Genesis to Revelation; Meg Crossman, Editor, 1996 </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>We need to understand what the goal of missions is, as well as what are the \n    strategies and issues regarding missions today - so we can effectively play \n    our role in God's global purpose. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>A. The Goal of missions is: the evangelization of the World</strong> \n  </p>\n  <p>Matt 28:19 Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Aren't we all missionaries? Myth: I'm a missionary here in my own country \n    You might be, but you probably are not. I hope you are all evangelists. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>B. Defining Our Terms: Evangelism vs. Evangelization</strong> </p>\n  <p>There is a difference between evangelism, missions &amp; evangelization Evangelism \n    - sharing the gospel &amp; inviting people to accept Christ for themselves \n    Missions - involves crossing cultural barriers to evangelize &amp; plant churches \n  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Types of evangelism</strong> </p>\n  <p>E = evangelism; # = of cultural barriers such as language, geography, economic/class \n    or caste, religion </p>\n  <p><strong>E-1</strong> evangelism is reaching out to people within one's own \n    language and culture. The only barrier is church. Someone like you who is \n    unchurched. &#xB7; Most powerful because the messenger understands the culture \n    of the people trying to reach. </p>\n  <p><strong>E-2</strong> evangelism is reaching out to a culture that is somewhat \n    different but with some similarities. </p>\n  <p><strong>E-3</strong> big jump in culture. It requires penetrating &amp; engaging \n    a culture that is distant &amp; very different from the messenger's. It is \n    the most difficult, but most needed type of evangelism. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Missions</strong> involves E-2 &amp; E-3 evangelism, but not E-1. \n    Missions is not just evangelism, begins with evangelism </p>\n  <p><strong>Evangelization -</strong> is the goal of evangelism. It includes: \n    &#xB7; Planting churches: discipling new believers, incorporating them into the \n    body of Christ where they can grow spiritually &amp; serve Christ. &#xB7; Propagation: \n    includes them spreading the Gospel to others in their own culture &amp; to \n    other cultures. </p>\n  <p>The Goal is the evangelization of world! </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>C. Viewing the World: political countries &amp; people groups </strong></p>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Jesus said Go &amp; make disciples of all nations&#x85; Myth: The work of \n    Missions is almost done because there is a church in every country. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>When we see the word \"nation\", we think of a \"political country\". \n    However, this isn't the concept expressed in the Bible. </p>\n  <p>1. Nation - Greek word ethnos - Biblically, an ethnic unit or people group \n    rather than a political country. Translated nation, people, heathen or Gentile \n    A more correct usage would be as in the phrase\" the Cherokee nation\", \n    referring to the tribe of Native Americans. In Rev 5:9 &amp; 10:11 not only \n    is the word \"nation\" used, but it is further spelled out as peoples, \n    tribes, tongues &amp; kindreds. </p>\n  <p>2. People group - people who are bound together by a common culture \"significantly \n    large sociological grouping of individuals who perceive themselves to have \n    a common affinity for one another because of their shared language, religion, \n    ethnicity, residence, occupation, class or caste, situation or combination \n    of these.\" It is what makes us, us and them, them. </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>A people group is the largest group within which the gospel can spread \n      along natural lines without encountering barriers of understanding or acceptance \n      due to culture, language, geography, etc. A country may have many people \n      groups. ex: Papua New Guinea &gt;800 languages </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>3. Unreached People Group - is a people group among which there is no indigenous \n    community of believing Christians with adequate numbers &amp; resources to \n    evangelize this people group without outside (cross-cultural) assistance. \n    Unreached people groups lack a church that has the numbers &amp; strength \n    to reach their own people. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <p>The world we need to be concerned with is the world of unreached people \n      groups. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Q7 - It is estimated that there are about 10,000 unreached people groups; \n    who have never yet heard the Good News of Jesus in a way that they can understand \n    it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Mostly they are found in 5 major cultural blocks: Muslim, Chinese, Hindu, \n      Buddhist and tribal cultures This represents about 40% of the world's population \n      (2-3 billion people). So the job is far from being finished! </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>V. How Is the Evangelization of the World Accomplished?</strong> </p>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>A. Plant multiplying churches in every people group of the world!</strong> \n    Churches that are able to spread the gospel throughout their own people group \n    and also beyond to penetrate other people groups. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <p>The resource most needed to plant multiplying churches is leaders. The \n      training of nationals is key missions work. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>B. Four Stages of Church Planting Relationships</strong> \n  </p><ul>\n    <li>Stage 1: Pioneer - First contact with a people group. </li>\n    <li>Stage 2: Parent - Missionary trains national leadership </li>\n    <li>Stage 3: Partnership - national leaders work as equals with missionaries. \n    </li>\n    <li>Stage 4: Participation - nationals lead the church, missionaries participate \n      only by invitation. </li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Distinction between: Regular missions: Cross-cultural evangelism (ideally \n    in association with Christians of the target culture) to a people group which \n    already has a sound indigenous church. Frontier Missions: Cross-cultural evangelism \n    to a people group who do not have a sound indigenous church (Stage 1 &amp; \n    2) </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>C. Where are the unreached people groups? All over the world</strong> \n  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>There is a window, where the vast majority of unreached are located. </p>\n  <p>1. Q8: 10/40 window: term coined for the area of the world between 10 degrees \n    and 40 degrees North latitude, which stretches from North Africa &amp; southern \n    Spain to Japan &amp; the northern part of the Philippines. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <p>There is an emphasis in missions on the 10/40 window because: a. Most of \n      the least evangelized peoples and countries of the world are here. b. This \n      is where 3 large religious blocs of unreached peoples are mainly found: \n      Islam, Hinduism &amp; Buddhism. c. The poor are there. Many of the 50 poorest \n      countries of the world are also the least evangelized countries of the world. \n      Poorest of the poor. Lowest quality of life. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>2. Brings us to our next Myth: I can't go when there is so much need here. \n    On one hand it is true, there is need here in the U.S., but realize the need \n    is far greater in the rest of the world. We should serve here. The problem \n    is there is no time or resources left for the lost &amp; poor of the world. \n    There is a great imbalance in the allocation of resources such as money, people \n    &amp; prayer. I don't have to look father than myself to know it's easier \n    to pray for my family &amp; friends than the lost of the world. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <p>For example: western church spending is as follows 95% domestic projects \n      4.5% regular missions .5% Frontier missions - most needed Balance - We need \n      to show concern for those near &amp; far. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>D. Nearly half the world's population is poor: </strong></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>1.

Holistic Development - Since the lost are often poor, then a holistic \n      ministry is needed. One in which evangelism, compassion &amp; social transformation \n      are inseparably related. Christian community development focuses on spiritual \n      &amp; physical needs (food, health, sanitation, and education), and aims \n      to bring a group to a place of self-sufficiency, spiritually &amp; physically. \n    </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <p>The Peoples in the 10/40 window need to be given priority &amp; it is \n        an incredible challenge to bring the Good News to the poor in these countries, \n        but with God all things are possible!!

The Challenge of Crossing Culture</strong></p>\n<p>This includes things we've covered - In addition, our own culture opposes missions. \n  The accusation is: Myth: Missionaries destroy culture - as they evangelize &amp; \n  plant churches </p>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>A. Cultural Imperialism</strong>- imposing our own culture on others. \n    This is the cry of our postmodern culture. Christian missionaries ruin cultures. \n    What right do missionaries have to intrude &amp; impose their beliefs &amp; \n    culture on others? This is an issue for which we all need to have a ready \n    answer. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>B. Our Answer</strong> </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>1. Yes, but missionaries have done far greater good. Unfortunately missionaries \n      have sometimes acted in a culture-destroying manner &amp; needlessly opposed \n      customs they did not understand. The world has been quick to notice the \n      mistakes &amp; stereotyped missionaries as cultural imperialists (as Abner \n      Hale in Hawaii clip). Overall missionaries have done far greater good, even \n      in the area of preserving culture. \"By learning the language of a tribal \n      group &amp; studying tribal culture and thought, missionaries have actually \n      done a good deal to preserve tribal cultures which might otherwise have \n      just disappeared.\" In addition all the medical care, orphanages, education, \n      &amp; helping the oppressed far outweighs missionaries mistakes. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <p>2. Some aspects of culture need to be changed. All cultures under authority \n      of God's word. Ex. tribe in Brazil had custom of sacrificing babies to demons \n      to try to prevent disease. Missionaries went, lived with the tribe, learned \n      their language, gave it an alphabet, translated the Word of God, taught \n      them to read. When the tribe learned about the love &amp; truth of God, \n      they had a rational and wonderful reason for not sacrificing babies to demons. \n    </p>\n    <p>3 . Cultures are in a constant state of change. The fact is commercial \n      exploiters &amp; other secular forces have destroyed tribal cultures. Ex. \n      Movie: The Mission 1750 Even in the recent past, land developers, settlers, \n      &amp; gold seekers have murdered Indians in South America &amp; taken what \n      they wanted from their territories. \"The most isolated minority cultures \n      must eventually be overwhelmed by the commercial and political expansion \n      of majority peoples. As governments want tribes to be assimilated into its \n      society's cultures, who will help these primitive tribes survive?\" \n      Don Richardson </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <p>These are the answers we need to have ready to refute the myth that missionaries \n      destroy culture. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Missions is not about cultural imperialism, yet there is the challenge \n      of C. Ethnocentrism - the way we do things is the right way. We all think \n      this, that's why our friends &amp; family's idiosyncrasies bother us. We \n      ask, why do you do it that way? All cultures are naturally ethnocentric. \n      A missionary has to struggle to overcome their normal tendency to assume \n      their culture's way is the only right way </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>D. Cultural Sensitivity </strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Some people reject the gospel not because they perceive it to be false, \n      but because they perceive it to be alien. Others reject the gospel because \n      they perceive it to be a threat to their own culture. When a missionary \n      enters another culture, he is conspicuously foreign. How can he explain \n      the gospel so it seems culturally right? </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <p>A missionary has to defuse these barriers through these means of cultural \n      sensitivity: </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <p><strong>1. Identification</strong>: developing a deep understanding of \n      the local culture &amp; a genuine appreciation of it, so there's not an \n      us &amp; them mentality. It is a sense of oneness with the people. Our example \n      is Christ. Because of His love, He identified with us to bring us God's \n      good news. 1 Cor 9:22 - Paul </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Another way missionaries overcomes barriers of foreignness &amp; threat \n      is: <br>\n      <strong>2. Contextualization:</strong> refers to finding ways to make the \n      gospel &amp; the rest of Christian teaching meaningful &amp; appealing to \n      the culture we hope to reach. Definition: \"Presenting the gospel in \n      ways which consider the world view of the local culture. Adapting the Biblical \n      message into forms that are true to the Scriptures but appropriate to the \n      local culture\" In our own culture, we try to make the gospel culturally \n      relevant. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Both the gospel and the church need to be contextualized. \"Peoples \n        who become Christian must be allowed to have expressions of worship, leadership, \n        theology, and practice that reflect their own culture. Once the basic \n        foundation of truth is laid, the receiving culture must determine its \n        own appropriate ways to communicate &amp; live out God's truth. It must \n        express its love for God within its own cultural framework.\" </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Identification &amp; contextualization are means of making God's message \n      understandable and acceptable in a new culture. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>VII. Missions involves cross-cultural evangelism &amp; church planting \n  </strong></p>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>The goal is to see a church planting movement begun in every people group. \n  </p>\n  <p>This quote sums up what we're talking about: </p>\n  <p>\"An estimated 75 percent of the world's non-Christians find themselves \n    in unreached people groups. That means that over two billion individuals for \n    whom Christ died will not hear of His love unless someone follows the call \n    of God, leaves their own culture, learns a new language, eats new food, adjusts \n    to a new lifestyle, loves new peoples who may appear unlovely, and shares \n    the gospel message with them. This is mission, pure and simple. The age of \n    missions is far from over. On the contrary, cross-cultural service for Christ \n    is the most massive &amp; most exciting challenge for Christians today.\" \n    Peter Wagner, 1992 (8-26) </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>VIII.

In the words of Jim Elliot, <em>\"He is no fool who gives \n      up what he cannot keep, in order to gain what he cannot lose.\"</em></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><a name=\"The%20Poor\">The Poor</a><br>\n  Urban Concern: Concern Christian Community Development </strong></p>\n<p><em>Why should we address social issues if Christ is coming back and we know \n  the world system is doomed? </em></p>\n<p><strong>1. Moral Command.</strong> It is a moral issue (not an eschatological \n  one) and sin if we do not show concern. </p>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>(Ezekiel 16:49)</strong> \" 'Now this was the \n    sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and \n    unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy. </p>\n  <p>Sin of omission. - lack of concern for the poor (not doing anything). This \n    is probably one of the biggest sins the church is involved in. Unfortunately \n    you probably don't hear much about this scripture or sin in the church today \n    or even in seminary </p>\n  <p>Why is that? </p>\n  <p>Someone wants us to avoid hearing about our own sin lest we turn, repent \n    and draw close to God. This would be the devil. What a powerful gospel we \n    would preach if the church could give real testimony to the love of God in \n    this area. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>2. Expression of the love of God (gospel)</strong> </p>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Does anyone know 1 John 3:16-17 ? </p>\n  <p><strong>(1 John 3:16-17)</strong> \"This is how we know \n    what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay \n    down our lives for our brothers. (17) If anyone has material possessions and \n    sees his brother in need but has no pity on him, how can the love of God be \n    in him?\" </p>\n  <p>The gospel is demonstration as well as proclamation. The greatest demonstration \n    of Gods love was Christ dying on the cross. He could have just told us he \n    loved us but he also demonstrated it in his actions. We need to demonstrate \n    the gospel through our actions of love for the poor, in addition to our explaination \n    of the love of God. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>3. We are responsible to represent the Character of God</strong> </p>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>(1 Peter 1:14-19)</strong> As obedient children, do \n    not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance. (15) \n    But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do; 16for it \n    is written: \"Be holy, because I am holy.\" (17) Since you call on \n    a Father who judges each man's work impartially, live your lives as strangers \n    here in reverent fear. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>A. God is concerned about justice for the oppressed and poor. </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><strong>(Psalm 140:12)</strong> I know that the LORD secures \n      justice for the poor and upholds the cause of the needy. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p>B. God identifies with the poor. </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>(Proverbs 14:31) He who oppresses the poor shows contempt \n      for their Maker, but whoever is kind to the needy honors God. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>To be Holy is to be like God. In this area it means to be concerned about \n    the poor to the extent that we act by doing something about their predicament. \n  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We shouldn't use our eschatology as a shield for our sin. As we will see, the \n  fact that Christ is coming back is a reason to serve the poor not a reason to \n  neglect them. </p>\n<p><strong>History of Xenos getting involved in Christian Community Development \n  </strong></p>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Our elders were bothered by the fact that our church was weak in the area \n    of ministry to the poor and hurting. We had tried some things in the past \n    but had never kept it going (Orient). So we began to save up money and teach \n    on the need for service and the variety of gifts in the Body Of Christ. A \n    year later I was hired on a part time basis while continuing in my role of \n    doing accounting and administration. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>We started a 4-phase plan:</strong> \n</p><ul>\n  <li><strong>1st phase.</strong> We began home church service ministries and \n    recruited a service ministry coordinator in each home church. </li>\n  <li><strong>2nd phase.</strong> We began service ministries to the whole church \n    such as single parents, CARE group, service network (replaced by NETWORKING). \n  </li>\n  <li><strong>3rd phase.</strong> We wanted to do something in the community of \n    need outside of the church. </li>\n  <li><strong>4th phase.</strong> Set up (or link with) a Christian Community \n    Development ministry overseas. </li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Let's look at the third phase more in depth and get a historical perspective \n    on how things have developed here at Xenos. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>I hooked up with a local group of pastors and others that were meeting about \n    prayer and racial reconciliation. They referred me to John Perkins ministry \n    in Mississippi called Voice of Calvalry. Ron Sider called this ministry the \n    best thing going in North America. I attended a workshop at Voice of Calvalry \n    in Mississippi. A week later I attended the first meeting of the Christian \n    Community Development Association (CCDA). This was a group of Christians from \n    around the country working in low income areas and committes to Christian \n    Community Development as it was defined by John Perkins. </p>\n  <p>I began to get input from other ministries such as Voice of Hope in Dallas, \n    Lawndale community church, Bethel New Life, and Circle Urban ministries in \n    Chicago. </p>\n  <p>We took the principles we learned from these different groups and applied \n    them to our local situation. In addition we continued to get input from John \n    Perkins and others. We got together with people from Rhema Christian Center \n    and began a Bible study at Windsor Terrace. Xenos then formed Urban Concern. \n  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Mission Statement </strong></p>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>The mission of Urban Concern is to work with individuals in the inner city \n    to break the cycle of poverty and hopelessness. Urban Concern is committed \n    to raising up leaders who will play an active role in restoring their community. \n  </p>\n  <p>How do we carry out that mission? I have given you two handouts. One is the \n    <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cdevphil.htm\">philosophy</a> (theology) and the other is the <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/fourds.htm\">\"4 \n    D\" strategy</a> underlying our ministries. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Philosophy</strong> </p>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>God has always had a concern for those who are poor, in need, oppressed, \n    and those who know God and are following God will demonstrate this through \n    their actions. </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><strong>(Jeremiah 22:15-16)</strong> \"Does it make \n      you a king to have more and more cedar? Did not your father have food and \n      drink? He did what was right and just, so all went well with him. (16) He \n      defended the cause of the poor and needy, and so all went well. Is that \n      not what it means to know me?\" declares the LORD.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p>This is what people do who know God. </p>\n  <p>It is the church's (&amp; Christians) responsibility to serve the poor and \n    bring them the gospel. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>4 D's.</strong> </p>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Define geographical area, describe the needs, distribute resources, and develop \n    leadership. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Structural sin</strong> in our society has developed segregation \n    between the rich and poor (as well as racial). To love our neighbor requires \n    us to make a relational link across these geographical boundaries that are \n    set up by the sin in our society. </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><strong>Lifestyle and friendship evangelism</strong> will fall short most \n      often in ministering to those in need today because most of us have relationships \n      with working people and live in middle class neighborhoods. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Linda Dillow in her book Creative Counterpart tries to justify not going \n      to the inner city poor by falsely interpreting Proverbs 31:20 \"She \n      opens her arms top the poor and extends her hands to the needy.\" Dillow \n      conveniently passes by the part about the excellent wife opening her arms \n      to the poor and focuses on the needy. She interprets needy then to apply \n      to people with many needs such as a divorce, or depression. Plently of people \n      with needs are in her own neighborhood she points out so she doesn't have \n      to go to the inner city poor and neither do you according to Dillow. The \n      problem is that while these needs are valid ones to meet in our own neighborhoods, \n      she is leaving out the needs of the poor that the verse refers to. Most \n      of us do have to go out of our own neighborhoods to fulfill the scriptures \n      command to reach out to the poor. </p>\n    <p>Here at Xenos we must have a lot of excellent wives (and single women) \n      because we find so many of them volunteering at Urban Concern in our various \n      ministries to the poor. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Avoiding the poor is a sin that is in our culture and we need to be aware \n    of it. Moving up and out has to be challenged as a materialistic and self-centered \n    philosophy. We should not just go along with the crowd as to where we live \n    or whom we have relationships with. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>(Phil. 2:3-8)</strong> Do nothing out of selfish ambition \n  or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. (4) \n  Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests \n  of others. (5) Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus: (6) \n  Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something \n  to be grasped, (7) but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, \n  being made in human likeness. (8) And being found in appearance as a man, he \n  humbled himself and became obedient to death--even death on a cross! </p>\n<p>Christ was born poor, became a refugee, lived as a homeless person and even \n  to the point of allowing himself to be killed. He didn't stay in heaven where \n  it was most comfortable or safe. A friend of mine who is on the CCDA board said \n  he was doing a survey of Christians and one of the questions he asked was \"Do \n  you think Jesus spent a lot of time with the poor, homeless and down and out? \n  Do you spend a lot of time with the homeless, poor and down and out?\" He \n  said that although Christians want to say they want to be like Jesus there is \n  a disconnect in this area. </p>\n<p>We need to consider the good of others in our choice of where to live and who \n  to have relationships with, and we should seek God's direction in these decisions \n  (rather than just following the flow of our culture). </p>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>I have seen hundreds pray to receive Christ in my ministry to the poor over \n    the last 9 years. Over nine years in ministry to the middle class, a few dozen. \n    We shouldn't assume that there will be less fruit in ministry among the poor. \n  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let's take a look at UC and see how practically these ideas have worked out \n</p>\n<p><strong>Video </strong></p>\n<p><em>What can you do? Everyone can do these things. </em></p>\n<p><strong>1. Volunteer.</strong> </p>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>There are over 1000 volunteers each year at UC. There are various volunteer \n    opportunities requiring different levels of commitment. The South Linden Bible \n    Study is our key program for outreach and evangelism. It meets every Monday \n    night and requires a couple of hours each week. Some people bring their kids \n    and have them go to the classes for their age. There are tours on the first \n    Monday of every month. 100's of children have prayed to receive Christ. Other \n    needs include One on One Mentors, After School helpers or academic tutors, \n    summer program, summer camp, Hope Builders is one weekend a month, and event \n    help is one time a year usually. I have volunteer applications or you can \n    call the Urban Concern office at 291-0885 and talk to Donna Spengler. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>2. Get others involved.</strong> </p>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Many Christians want to follow the commands of scripture to serve the poor \n    but don't know how to go about that. If you know of Christians outside of \n    Xenos you might want to bring them to the silent auction. This is a great \n    way to introduce people to Urban Concern. People also use this event to bring \n    non-Christians they are reaching out to. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>3. Give to the general fund.</strong> </p>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Urban Concern is supported through the general fund at Xenos. Almost $200,000 \n    came to UC from the general fund of Xenos in 1999. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>4. Pray.</strong></p>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Seek God's will in what you should do but also pray for people and families \n    that are poor and oppressed. </p>\n  <p>There are tragic situations that children and families are in here in Columbus \n    (as well as around the world). </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>5. Learn what the Bible says about the poor and oppressed </strong></p>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>(2 Tim. 2:15)</strong> Do your best to present yourself \n    to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who \n    correctly handles the word of truth. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>You should be able to know and explain the scriptures on the poor - it is \n    a huge amount of scripture in the Bible. </p>\n  <p>I always encourage people to first take the Principles class to get an overall \n    grounding for their Christian walk with God. Once you have done that you need \n    to take my Christian Community Development class. It's a five week course \n    offered the second half of winter quarter.Everyone should have the basic introduction \n    to the scriptures and ministry to the poor even if it is not the area God \n    has called you into making your primary ministry. There are also resources \n    such as tapes from CCDA conference, videos and books at the study center. \n    Start with John Perkins and go from there. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>(Matthew 25:31-36)</strong> \"When the Son of Man \n  comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his throne in \n  heavenly glory. (32) All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will \n  separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from \n  the goats. (33) He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. \n  (34) \"Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are \n  blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since \n  the creation of the world.

Note KJV and NKJV textual error: \" . . . who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit.\"  Fifty-four scholars of the original languages translated the KJV from 1605-1611. Unfortunately, the earliest Greek manuscripts they had access to were from about 1000 A.D. and all contained the phrase translated, \"who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit.\"  When earlier manuscripts became available, translators came to the conclusion that the phrase had been inserted, and likely from Romans 8:4.  Therefore most modern translations omit the phrase.<br>\n      The New King James and the King James 2000 continue to include this  phrase even though it lacks manuscript attestation.<br>\n      <br>\n      <strong>(Bruce Metzger) </strong>\"The \n      King James scholars in 1611 had to use printed editions of the Greek NT \n      that rested upon the late Greek manuscripts, none of which was older than \n      the 10th or 11th century.

This is a response which is always relevant to our current spiritual \n      condition. We never make such progress in sanctification that we can depend \n      on it for (God's) acceptance.

Most Protestants have \n      therefore concluded that assurance of salvation is necessary for healthy \n      spirituality. Christians need to know that they have a secure status as \n      adopted sons and daughters of God in order to behave naturally in his presence. \n      For us to be phasing in and out of sonship according to our behavior, constantly \n      testing our experiences to make sure we are in a 'state of grace,' short-circuits \n      the reality of grace.\" (Richard Lovelace, <i>Renewal as a Way of Life</i>, \n      pp. 142,143.) </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>We cannot relate to others \n      appropriately unless we prioritize God's acceptance of us.&#xA0;</strong></li>\n  </ul>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>God's acceptance and forgiveness \n      of us is the dynamic that motivates us to accept and forgive others.

His response to the Judaizers is an example \n    of how to deal with this tendency. He has no give on this issue, and is willing \n    to fight over it (Gal. 1:6-9; 5:14; Phil. 3:1-3). We must be aware of contemporary \n    Judaizers and know how to refute them if we want to have healthy Christian \n    lives and help others have the same.

We'll talk more about Arminius and his views next week. Radical Arminian \n  groups (some Nazarenes; Church of Christ; etc.) teach that true Christians can \n  lose God's acceptance by falling into sin (drunkenness; sexual immorality; etc.). \n  They usually use the following verses to support this belief. \n  <p><strong>Before we plunge into this, \n    we should note that there are two different versions of Non-Eternal Security: \n    </strong></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <ul>\n      <li> <strong>Rejecting Christ </strong>(Heb. \n        6,10; 2 Tim. 2:12) - Acceptance is based solely on the finished work of \n        Christ. Just as we choose freely to receive this gift, we may choose freely \n        to reject it. This view makes better sense of the passages cited (since \n        they emphasize denying Christ rather than committing sins), and does not \n        violate salvation by grace through faith alone. Properly understood, it \n        doesn't really threaten the Christian's security since they don't intend \n        to reject Christ. </li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li> <strong>Losing Salvation By Moral \n        Lapses</strong> <b><i>or</i> Failure To Mature (Radical Arminianism)</b>- \n        \"Backsliding\" here means reverting to sinful habits and thereby \n        forfeiting God's acceptance. This is heresy, because if we can lose God's \n        acceptance by our sins, then we must be maintaining God's acceptance by \n        our good works.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>\"Wesleyanism . . . finds \n        the doctrine of sanctification not only biblical and practical but also \n        essential to salvation . . . The responsibility for continued obedience \n        is binding on the Christian. The gospel requires much more than the 'acceptance' \n        of Christ as a Personal Savior . . . The whole Bible, and particularly \n        the New Testament, gives repeated counsel and command to the believer \n        to take very positive steps toward moral recovery. These requirements \n        are absolute. They are things the believer must do . . . Eternal destiny, \n        not merely rewards, is at stake. God's forgiveness does not exhaust the \n        obligations of the gospel; it begins the life of obligation.\" (Mildred \n        Bangs Wynkoop, <i>Foundations of Wesleyan-Arminian Theology</i> [Kansas \n        City: Beacon Hill Press, 1967], pp. 122,124.)</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><b>Note:</b> \n    We admit that the plain sense of some of these passages seems to indicate \n    you can lose your salvation.

This highly \n      ritualistic way of relating to God, which was appropriate in the Old Covenant \n      because of its instructional value, has been replaced by the centrality \n      of a personal relationship with God through the indwelling Holy Spirit (Gal. \n      4:3-11). Ritual in the New Covenant has a much smaller role because of this \n      (from hundreds of prescribed rituals to two; from strictly regulated rituals \n      to loosely regulated). </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><strong>Important qualification: </strong>We \n    are not saying that there are no saved Catholics! There are, in fact, many \n    Catholics know the Lord and serve him. We are simply saying that they are \n    saved and serving <i>in spite of</i> Catholic theology, not <i>because</i> \n    of it. </p>\n  <p><strong>Practical Advice:</strong> \n    Don't go out and attack your Catholic family and friends! Many Catholics don't \n    even know what their church teaches. Instead, emphasize the biblical teaching \n    on salvation as a free gift and your personal testimony. Many get saved from \n    this, and then begin to see for themselves that their old church was off in \n    its teaching . . . </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong><a name=\"a8\"></a>3: Water Baptism</strong></h3>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Many people and denominations teach \n    that water baptism is necessary for salvation. Passages such as Acts 2:38, \n    Mark 16:16, 1 Peter 3:21, Romans 6:3,4 and Col. 2:12 seem to teach this position. \n    However, on closer examination, this teaching is not scriptural for the following \n    reasons: </p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>The biblical teaching on salvation \n    by grace through faith alone is very clear</strong> (John 1:12; Eph 2:8,9; \n    Acts 16:30,31; Romans 3:24; Titus 3:5).<br>\n    </li>\n  <p><strong>Gal. 2:16</strong> is especially \n    significant in light of its historical setting. Paul is refuting the Judaizers' \n    insistence that faith in Christ is not sufficient for salvation, but that \n    circumcision is also required. These are parallel teachings in that both require \n    submission to a biblical ritual for salvation. </p>\n  <li><strong>Passages used to support this \n    teaching can be harmonized to the \"salvation by faith alone\" position \n    described above.</strong><br>\n    </li>\n  <p><strong>Acts 2:38 </strong>gives two \n    imperatives (\"repent\" and \"be baptized\"), followed by \n    two results (\"forgiveness of sins\" and \"you shall receive the \n    gift of the Holy Spirit\"). Note that in Peter's next speech (Acts 3:19), \n    he gives one imperative (\"repent and return\") and promises the same \n    two results (\"sins wiped away\" and \"times of refreshing from \n    God's presence\"). If water baptism is required for forgiveness and the \n    Holy Spirit, why did Peter omit this imperative? Therefore, it is best to \n    understand the promises of Acts 2:38 as connected to the command to \"repent\" \n    alone. Peter also announced that it is God's will for believers to be water \n    baptized, but he did not mean that baptism was necessary for salvation. </p>\n  <p><strong>Mark 16:16</strong> is part \n    of the \"long ending\" of Mark (vs 9-20) that was not part of the \n    original text. For more information on this textual issue, see Mark Lane, \n    <i>The Gospel According to Mark </i>(Grand Rapids: Eerdmans Publishing Co., \n    1974), pp.&#xA0;601-605.</p>\n</ul>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>In 1 Pet.&#xA0;3:21</strong>, \n    Peter says, \".&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;corresponding to that, baptism now \n    saves you.\" The \"that\" refers to how God rescued Noah and his \n    family from the flood (vs. 20). \"Corresponding\" is <i>antitupon</i>, \n    or \"anti-type.\" Peter thus identifies the ark rescue as a prophetic \n    type of our rescue through Christ. Noah and his family were NOT saved by being \n    water baptized, but by being put into (baptized into) the <i>ark</i>. In the \n    same way, believers in Christ are rescued from God's judgment by being put \n    into (baptized into) Christ. Therefore, the \"baptism\" in vs. 21 \n    refers to the baptism by the Holy Spirit into Christ (see 1&#xA0;Cor.&#xA0;12:13), \n    not water baptism. Peter seems intent on making this point by adding \".&#xA0;.&#xA0;. \n    not the removal of dirt from the flesh&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.\"</p>\n  <p><strong>Rom.&#xA0;6:3,4 and Col.&#xA0;2:12</strong> \n    both refer to Spirit-baptism into Christ rather than to water baptism, since \n    Paul says clearly in 1&#xA0;Cor.&#xA0;12:13 that Spirit-baptism is the baptism \n    that unites us with Christ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Consider also these additional \n    points: </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>In Acts&#xA0;10:47</strong>, \n    Cornelius and his household receive the Holy Spirit immediately when they \n    believe the gospel. Peter insists that they be allowed to undergo water baptism \n    because they have receive the Spirit. Since receiving the Holy Spirit is synonymous \n    with salvation and necessary in order to be a Christian (Rom.&#xA0;8:9), water \n    baptism clearly had no bearing on their salvation. If this was the case with \n    Cornelius and his household, why would God change something this important?</p>\n  <p><strong>In 1&#xA0;Cor.&#xA0;1:17</strong>, \n    Paul says, \"Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel.\" \n    How could Paul say this if water baptism was necessary for salvation? Paul \n    believed Christians should be baptized, but he obviously saw baptism as so \n    much less important than explaining the gospel that he could pit them against \n    each other in this verse. Why? Because the gospel saves when people believe \n    it (Rom.&#xA0;1:16), while water baptism does not save.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Is water baptism required \n    or not? </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Yes and No. Clearly Jesus commanded \n    us to be baptized and to baptize (Matt.&#xA0;28:19). In this sense, baptism \n    is required. We should be baptized after receiving Christ because Jesus has \n    told us to proclaim our faith in him in this way. But, as we have seen above, \n    baptism is not required for salvation. Like many other commands in scripture, \n    we should obey them out of gratitude for our salvation, not as requirements \n    for our salvation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong><a name=\"a5\">4: Lordship Theology </a></strong></h3>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Lordship theologians affirm \n    eternal security, but they define saving faith in a way that requires complete \n    commitment to Christ and denies the possibility of carnal Christians.</strong> \n    This has the same practical effect as the above \"losing salvation through \n    moral lapses\" view: unless you live a righteous life, you have no basis \n    for thinking you are saved. </p>\n  <p><strong>(John F. MacArthur) </strong>\" \n    . . . eternal life is indeed a free gift. . .that does not mean there is no \n    cost in terms of salvation's impact on the sinner's life. This paradox may \n    be difficult but it is nevertheless true: salvation is both free and costly \n    . . . It (saving faith) is an exchange of all that we are for all that Christ \n    is. And it denotes implicit obedience, full surrender to the lordship of Christ. \n    Nothing less can qualify as saving faith . . . This is the kind of totally \n    committed response the Lord Jesus called for. A desire to follow him at any \n    cost. Absolute surrender. A full exchange of self for the Savior. It is the \n    only response that will open the gates of the kingdom.\" (John F. MacArthur, \n    <i>The Gospel According To Jesus</i> (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1988), pp.&#xA0;140, \n    141) </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>This is double-talk. If salvation \n      is free, it costs us nothing; if it is costly to us, then it is not free.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><strong>(John F. MacArthur)</strong> \n    \"(Saving faith) retains no privileges. It clings to no cherished sins, \n    no treasured possessions, no secret self-indulgences. It is unconditional \n    surrender, a willingness to do anything the Lord demands.\" (John F. MacArthur, \n    <i>The Gospel According To Jesus</i> (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1988), pp.&#xA0;139, \n    140) </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>This is absolutely ridiculous.

Accordingly, we must attain to a perfect attitude of submission \n      before we can be forgiven. </p>\n    <p>Why do the epistles urge Christians \n      to commit themselves more fully to Christ (Rom. 12:1; 1 Pet. 3:15) if saving \n      faith is full commitment? Why do the epistles acknowledge that there are \n      carnal Christians (1 Cor. 3:3,15), and why do they urge <i>Christians</i> \n      not to submit to sin (Rom. 6:12,13)?</p>\n    <p><strong>To demand from a person a \n      \"complete change of heart, attitude, interest, and direction\" \n      is to make regenerate behavior from an unregenerate person the requirement \n      for regeneration! </strong></p>\n    <p><strong>(D.

In fact, regardless of \n    what material we study -- in a class, personal time with the Lord, at a teaching, \n    or wherever -- we will get NOTHING out of it if are not able to see ourselves \n    as God does. So tonight let's prepare our own spiritual soil for the Lord \n    to plant seeds by first reminding ourself of the need to be self-aware and \n    secondly to consider what do we expect and pursue from God.</p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>1) Self-Awareness</p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Too many Christians do not take \n        the time to examine themselves. They examine the situation or circumstances \n        they are in but not their character and motives that underly and actually \n        drive their actions, words, attitudes, and thought-life. Do we take the \n        time to look deeper at ourselves? EG. - When we taught on \"appropriating \n        our new identity\" in week 3, if you found it difficult to understand \n        the <i>necessity of</i> or <i>how to </i>examine your self on the level \n        of false beliefs about your identity, then you probably need to develop \n        more in this area.</p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>Socrates says, \"An unexamined \n          life is not worth living.\"</p>\n        <p>We should resolve to want to \n          see ourselves as God does. That under grace we want him to reveal things \n          about us that we know under grace he will grow us through. David has \n          the courage to pray in Ps. 139:23,24 (read) - we should as well. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>2) What do we expect \n      from our relationship with God? And similarly, What do we pursue in our \n      relationship with God?</p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Do we primarily follow God because we expect and pursue the benefits \n        to ourselves? Or to bear fruit which brings glory to God?</p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>If we PRIMARILY expect \"the blessed life\" we might dabble \n          in God's purposes (ministry), or even do a fair amount...for a while. \n          But when the benefits don't come our way, we fold (EG. don't feel a \n          real closeness with God, don't bear fruit in leading people to Christ \n          or discipleship, tough circumstances in life continue, financial setbacks \n          still happen, relationships are still difficult to maintain). </p>\n        <blockquote> \n          <p>Our expectations have been dashed upon the rocks. Do we secretly, \n            down deep primarily pursue God because of what we believe is in it \n            for us?</p>\n        </blockquote>\n        <p>If we PRIMARILY are driven by a desire to bear fruit in God's purposes \n          then we understand that the personal benefits (growing experience of \n          depth with God, diminishing anxieties in areas of bad circumstances, \n          experience of fulfillment, etc.) will occur but what really consumes \n          our thinking and prayer is a desire to bring him glory by being used \n          by him in the Great Commission -- reaching the lost and discipling Christians.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p>One of the best ways to self-examine here is to ask \"what do I pursue?\" \n        Where are my energies spent? </p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>Also, what causes me the most distress? Lack of comfort, pleasure, \n          &amp; secure living, lack of close experience with God - or lack of \n          bearing fruit for the Lord?</p>\n        <p>Consider Paul: Look at his description of his \"joy\" and note \n          what it is inevitably associated with (Phil. 1:3-5,7; 2:2,17-18). Note \n          his joy is always associated with the Gospel being furthered - fruit \n          being born.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Our \"expectations\" of how God works in the life of the Christian \n      has a direct bearing on our susceptibility to the topic of this and next \n      week. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><strong><a name=\"a1\"></a>Definition of Restorationism:</strong> \n    A movement emphasizing the belief that God's miraculous working in the gospels, \n    Acts (and Corinth?) describes the <em>normal</em> Christian life (individually \n    and corporately). Restorationists therefore seek to <em>restore today's church \n    </em>to reflect that perspective. </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Third wave charismatics don't normally \n      use \"restorationism\" to refer to themselves.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><strong>History:</strong> Three \"waves\" \n    of restorationism have occurred during the 20th century; all 3 are still present \n    today. </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <ol>\n      <li><em>Pentecostalism</em> (started \n        early 20th cent.): Many believe speaking in tongues is a necessary evidence \n        of personal salvation (Apostolic Church) and that physical healing can \n        always be appropriated by faith (healing in the atonement). They tend \n        to be concerned about doctrine, and are somewhat sectarian. </li>\n      <li><em>Charismatic Movement </em>(started \n        mid 20th cent.): They believe a second act of grace of being \"Spirit-filled\" \n        or Spirit-baptized\" is necessary after conversion, and tongues are \n        evidence of this; more focused on experience than doctrine, so it spread \n        through Catholic and dead, ritualistic, liberal Protestant denominations \n        (Episcopalians). </li>\n      <li><em>\"Third Wave\" </em>(started \n        late 20th cent.): \"Signs and Wonders\" movement (e.g., Vineyard); \n        goal is to bring the full power of the Spirit as they see him working \n        in the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles, into mainstream evangelical churches.&#xA0; \n        They don't hold to a second act of grace, tongues as evidence of salvation, \n        or healing in the atonement.</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>There is a wide range of perspectives \n      and practices among restorationists. We agree with their desire to restore \n      a New Testament style Christianity, enthusiasm for the things of God, an \n      expectation of God's supernatural involvement, and focus on evangelism and \n      missions. We disagree with some features of restorationism and find that \n      many in this camp have serious problems in their interpretation of scripture \n      and practical application of scripture. This week we will deal with scripture \n      interpretation and next week we will address issues of practice.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Factors Leading To Spiritual \n    Imbalance:</strong> If you don't know how to respond to this issue, you will \n    be especially vulnerable during your times of dryness, discouragement, confusion, \n    etc.--and you won't be able to help younger Christians who are vulnerable \n    in this area. </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Other areas that leave us open for \n      imbalance: previous experiences, passivity, peer pressure, temperamental \n      inclinations, desiring a quick fix, reluctance to judge the validity of \n      someone else's spiritual experience, etc.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p>Therefore, while this area is doctrinally \n    non-essential (<i>not</i> heretics like Jehovah's Witnesses), it is very important \n    because it sets the <i>tone</i> of what we expect and how we define spiritual \n    vitality and maturity. It is not enough to teach proper view of spiritual \n    growth--we also need to be able to discern and reject aberrant views! </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> \n  <p>\"Hermeneutics\" is the study \n    of interpretation of the Bible.</p>\n  <h3><a name=\"b1\" id=\"b1\"></a>1. Miracles \n    are not normative in biblical history.</h3>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>How frequent are miracles in the \n      Bible?&#xA0; Christians commonly assume that people living in biblical times \n      experienced overt miracles as a normal state of affairs. But this is not \n      the case. When we look at the entire biblical record (which covers over \n      2200 years), we discover that there are a few periods of concentrated miraculous \n      activity. These periods usually correspond to crucial junctures in God's \n      redemptive plan (e.g., Abraham; the Exodus &amp; Conquest; Elijah &amp; \n      Elishah; Jesus &amp; the Apostles; the end of the age). </p>\n    <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu2w91.jpg\" alt=\"wpe1.jpg (13076 bytes)\" width=\"820\"></p>\n    <p>The Old Testament psalmists frequently \n      look back on the Exodus as special because of the outpouring of miracles \n      (Psalm 105:27ff), and Old Testament prophets look forward to the coming \n      of Messiah as a period of special miraculous activity (see Isa.&#xA0;35,61). \n      This clearly implies that they were not experiencing a lot of miraculous \n      activity in their own days.</p>\n    <p>\"The popular notion \n      that Bible abounds with miracles, so that they are present on practically \n      every page, is refuted by a simple reading of the Scriptures. As Sir Robert \n      Anderson showed in his volume The Silence of God, miracles have generally \n      occurred in periods, the great ones being the creation, the exodus, the \n      age of Elijah and Elisha, the time of Daniel, and the days of Christ and \n      the apostles. That we should be living in a period of the silence of God \n      (so far as miracle is concerned) should not trouble us unduly, seeing there \n      have been other times when this was true.\" \n      Everett F. Harrison, A Short Life of Christ (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans Publishing \n      Co.:1997), p. 112.<br>\n       </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><strong><a name=\"b2\" id=\"b2\"></a>2. \n    Biblical <em>descriptions </em>of miracles are not <em>prescriptions </em>for \n    all Christians to do.</strong></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Define the difference between <em>descriptive</em> \n      and <em>prescriptive </em>biblical text. </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Restorationists see the New Testament \n        narrative (gospels and Acts) as a paradigm for normal Christianity. Since \n        these passages seemingly describe frequent miracles, they conclude that \n        signs and wonders should be normative for spiritual Christians. </p>\n      <p>But this is improper interpretation, \n        because there are <i>unique features </i>in these accounts that <i>should \n        not be factored </i>into our general conclusions about spirituality (see \n        below). Instead, we should look primarily to the didactic (teaching) portions \n        of the New Testament which refer to all Christians. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>There are many things described in \n      the Bible that we don't feel compelled to imitate (dress, diet, Paul cutting \n      his hair to take a nazarite vow, the apostles' lifestyle as itinerant missionaries, \n      Paul's celibacy, Peter striking Ananias and Saphria dead, Paul striking \n      Elymas blind).</p>\n    <p>How, then, do we decide what examples \n      we should follow?</p>\n    <blockquote>  \n      <p><b>(Stott)</b> \"<em>What is described </em>in Scripture as having \n        happened to others <em>is not necessarily intended for us</em>, whereas \n        what is promised to us we should appropriate, and what is commanded us \n        we are to obey&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;What is descriptive is valuable \n        (in determining what God intends for all Christians) only in so far as \n        it is interpreted by what is didactic&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;<em>We \n        must derive our standards of belief and behavior from the teaching of \n        the New Testament&#xA0;</em>.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;rather than from the \n        practices and experiences which it portrays.\" (John R. W.

It would also include those portions of Jesus' teaching which \n        concern the church, the apostles' teaching in Acts, and most of the pastoral \n        epistles. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><i></i>The point:&#xA0; we interpret \n      the <em>descriptive</em> in light of the <em>prescriptive.</em> Maxim: We \n      interpret the descriptions in the Gospels and Acts in light of what the \n      epistles teach.</p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>And what do the Epistles emphasize?&#xA0; \n        We discover that signs and wonders are neither prescribed (instructed \n        to do) nor emphasized. Rather, the emphasis is on spiritual maturity defined \n        as doctrinal fidelity, biblical love, and moral transformation--through \n        walking in the Spirit. This is the way God has designed the sanctification \n        process according to the New Testament.</p>\n      <p>\"If miracles aren't normative, \n        why are they so prevalent in the gospels and Acts?\"...</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <h4><a name=\"b3\" id=\"b3\"></a><strong>3. \n    God used many miracles for unique reasons in the Gospels.</strong></h4>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Jesus was the Messiah, and therefore \n      he did some special things! Certainly we cannot make everything he said \n      and did the norm for all Christians! There were at least two reasons for \n      Jesus' miracles: </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <ul>\n        <li>Evidence for his identity: His \n          miracle ministry was one fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy (Mt. \n          11:3-5). He cited his unique miracle ministry as one of the lines of \n          evidence for his Messiahship (Matt. 11:3-5; Jn. 5:36; 10:37,38). </li>\n        <li>Illustrated and validated Jesus' \n          claims: They were also \"signs\" (<i>sumeia</i>) that revealed \n          his identity (when explained by his words). In other words, his miracles \n          were preceded or followed by teaching in which he explained his unique \n          spiritual provision for people (5OOO FED &gt;&gt; \"I AM THE BREAD \n          OF LIFE;\" PARALYTIC HEALED &gt;&gt; \"I HAVE THE AUTHORITY \n          TO FORGIVE SINS;\" RAISED LAZARUS &gt;&gt; \"I AM THE RESURRECTION \n          &amp; THE LIFE\"; HEALS BLIND MAN &gt;&gt; \"I AM THE LIGHT \n          OF THE WORLD\") </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>The point is: Because Jesus was \n        the unique Messiah, we would expect him to do unique miracles. Even then, \n        the miracles did not take center stage, but drew people to the truth of \n        the message. . . </p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p>\"Once again the wrong inference \n          must not be drawn. The point is not that signs and wonders are inevitably \n          bad, but that they are never of first importance.\" (D.A. Carson, \n          \"Power Religion\" ed. by Michael Horton (Chicago: Moody Press, \n          1992) p. 98.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p>\"What about Jn. 14:12? Doesn't \n        Jesus promise that all Christians should be able to do the same kinds \n        of miracles--and more of them?\" </p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <blockquote>  \n          <p><b>(John 14:12)</b> \"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes \n            in Me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than \n            these shall he do; because I go to the Father.</p>\n           </blockquote>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Greater in number \n          <blockquote> \n            <p>(D. A. Carson) This promise \n              was evidently spoken to all Christians (\"he who believes in \n              me\"). The term \"greater\" evidently refers not to \n              qualitatively greater miracles (how could you do something greater \n              than raising people from the dead?), but quantitatively greater. \n              Whereas Jesus was limited to one body and a three year ministry, \n              the body of Christ is composed of many people over a long period \n              of time. So, Jesus predicts that the church (by the power of the \n              Holy Spirit) will do even more miracles than Jesus did. \"Might \n              'greater' mean 'more numerous' or 'more widely dispersed?' In that \n              sense, Christians have indeed done 'greater' things than Jesus did. \n              We have preached all over the world, seen millions of men and women \n              converted, dispensed aid, education, and food to still more millions. \n              The 'greater' works may therefore be the gathering of converts into \n              the church through the witness of the disciples (cf. 17:20; 20:29), \n              and the overflow of kindness that stems from transformed lives.\" \n              (D.

They were authorized to perform \n        miracles like Jesus' to validate their message  </p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p><strong>2 Cor. 12:12* </strong>The \n          signs of a true apostle were performed among you with all perseverance, \n          by signs and wonders and miracles.</p>\n        <p><b>Heb. 2:1-4</b> For this reason we must pay much closer \n          attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it.

After it was at the first spoken \n          through the Lord, it was confirmed to us by those who heard, (4) God \n          also bearing witness with them, both by signs and wonders and by various \n          miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit according to His own will.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      c. There are no apostles today in the sense of Christ's authorized Apostles. \n      <blockquote> \n        <p>\"But there are probably \n          apostles today.\"&#xA0; Probably not. The New Testament says that \n          witnessing the resurrected Christ was a requirement for being an Apostle \n          (1 Cor. 9:1; Acts 1:22). Paul says in 1 Cor. 15:8 that he was the \"last \n          of all\" to witness the resurrected Christ. Therefore, there are \n          no more Apostles after Paul.</p>\n        <p>The New Testament seems to make \n          a distinction between \"Apostles\" and \"apostles.\" \n          \"Apostles\" are the ones described above and ended in the first \n          century (contra Roman Catholic doctrine of papal authority through Apostolic \n          succession). Small \"a\" \"apostles\" is used more generically \n          to describe appointed messengers (2 Cor. 8:23 \"messengers\") \n          or perhaps itinerant church-planters (Rom. 16:7). </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p>Important Qualification:&#xA0; \n        One need not conclude from this that God never performs miracles through \n        the church today, but one would conclude that such working is probably \n        not as frequent as it was during Jesus' and the Apostles' ministries. \n        </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Acts describes a unique period \n        in history. Acts was a transitional stage from the Old to the New Covenant--and \n        therefore a unique period in church history, never again to be repeated. \n        This explains why there was a delay in some cases between people believing \n        and receiving the Holy Spirit, and why tongues were used in a special \n        way. Therefore, it is a mistake to claim (as some restorationists do) \n        that these two phenomena (receiving the Holy Spirit at a separate moment \n        from conversion and speaking in tongues) should be normative for the church \n        today. NOTE: There is more to the tongues issue, and we will address it \n        soon.  \n        <blockquote> \n          <p>First of all, remember that \n            we should interpret descriptive in light of didactic passages. Paul \n            makes it clear that the norm is for Christians to receive the Spirit \n            at the moment of belief (Eph. 1:13,14). He also makes it clear that \n            while all Christians have been baptized by the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13), \n            not all Christians speak in tongues (1 Cor. 12:30). </p>\n          <p>Also bear in mind that apart \n            from these passages, there is no evidence that the thousands of other \n            converts in Acts spoke in tongues or experienced a delay between belief \n            and receiving the Holy Spirit. </p>\n        </blockquote>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>With this in view, how might we \n        understand the deviation from the norm in Acts 2,8,10,19**? </p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>Acts 2:1-12 </p>\n        <blockquote> \n          <p>There was delay between believing \n            in Christ and receiving the Spirit, because they were Old Covenant \n            believers and the New Covenant didn't start until Pentecost.</p>\n          <p>Tongues given to validate Jesus' \n            promise (Acts 1:5), to provide with preaching opportunity and (for \n            later reference) to prove that non-Jewish believers were now equal \n            members of God's people. </p>\n        </blockquote>\n        <p>Acts 8:14-24 </p>\n        <blockquote> \n          <p>Delay either because Peter \n            had \"keys of the kingdom\" (Matt. 16:18,19), or to prevent \n            a Samaritan Christian faction by consolidating the apostles' authority.</p>\n          <p>Tongues (maybe) to show that \n            Samaritan believers were equally saved. </p>\n        </blockquote>\n        <p>Acts 10:44-46 </p>\n        <blockquote> \n          <p>No delay.</p>\n          <p>Tongues to prove that Gentile \n            believers were equally saved (Acts 11:15-18). </p>\n        </blockquote>\n        <p>Acts 19:1-7 </p>\n        <blockquote> \n          <p>Delay because they were Old \n            Covenant believers.</p>\n          <p>Tongues probably to prove to \n            them that Jesus was indeed the Messiah, and to confirm Paul's apostolic \n            authority. </p>\n        </blockquote>\n      </blockquote>\n    </blockquote>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Therefore, while there is no evidence \n        that the gift of tongues has been withdrawn (see below), it is unbiblical \n        to teach that we must speak in tongues to be saved (old line Pentecostalism) \n        or to be Spirit-filled (charismatics and more recent pentacostals). </p>\n      <p>It is also unbiblical to assume \n        that there is normally a delay between belief in the gospel and receiving \n        the Holy Spirit. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Summary of the Acts accounts:</p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>(D. A. Carson) \"Acts provides \n        not a paradigm for individual Christian experience, but the account of \n        the gospel's outward movement, geographically, racially, and above all \n        theologically.\" (D.A. Carson, <em>Showing the Spirit</em>, p. 150.)</p>\n      <p>Luke was narrating a \"highlights \n        film\" of a unique period in church history led by unique spokesmen. \n        His purpose was to narrate the expansion of the gospel in fulfillment \n        of Acts 1:8. There is no evidence that Luke intended his record to serve \n        as a paradigm for all churches or individuals, because we do not see some \n        of the extraordinary events and practices described in Acts (e.g. Acts \n        19:11,12) reiterated in the epistles. However, the early church as described \n        in Acts does serve as a model for us in whatever areas <em>are also mandated \n        in the didactic portions </em>of the New Testament (e.g., evangelism and \n        missions; prayer; sacrificial giving; etc.). </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Summarize each of the four main hermeneutical\n  problems. </p><ul>\n    <li>Miracles are not normative in biblical history.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Biblical descriptions of miracles are not prescriptions for all Christians to do.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul>\n    <li>God used many miracles for unique reasons in the Gospels.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul>\n    <li>God used many miracles for unique reasons in Acts.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>2 Cor. 12:12* -</strong> the apostles\n  were uniquely authorized to perform signs and wonders and miracles </p>\n  <p><strong>Acts 2,8,10,19** -</strong> instances of\n  delay between belief in Christ and receiving the Holy Spirit; also instances of speaking\n  in tongues </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> \n  <p><b>Complete church visits and read 1 Cor. 14 carefully.</b></p>\n  <p><strong>Start studying for the exam! </strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu2w91.jpg","title":"Christian Principles Unit 2: Restorationism","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu2w9.htm"}

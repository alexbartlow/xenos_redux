S. Lewis spoke of the two most common \n    errors people tend to make about Satan: \"There are two equal and opposite \n    errors into which our race can fall about the devils. One is to disbelieve \n    in their existence. The other is to believe, and to feel an excessive and \n    unhealthy interest in them. They themselves are equally pleased by both errors, \n    and hail a materialist or a magician with the same delight.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Following the naturalism of the nineteenth \n    and twentieth centuries, liberal and neo-orthodox Christianity rejected Satan's \n    literal existence as primitive superstition. They reinterpreted the biblical \n    accounts of demon-possession in accordance with then-current psychological \n    theories. While evangelicals never went this far because of their high view \n    of scripture, they were sometimes guilty of mere mental assent without maintaining \n    an effective theology of spiritual warfare. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Pentecostals and charismatics, on the \n    other hand, have always emphasized the importance of spiritual warfare. They, \n    however, have often fallen into the opposite error against which Lewis warned. \n    Deeds of the flesh become demons to be exorcised. For example, on the topic \n    of sanctification, some Christian authors emphasize freedom from demonic influence \n    rather than ongoing choices to walk in the Spirit. For some, fear of Satan's \n    plots and powers overshadows Christ's victory over him (e.g. satanic ritual \n    abuse), and superstitious remedies become more popular than solid biblical \n    response (e.g., spiritual mapping; exorcism rituals). Over the last twenty \n    years, our culture has also become much more open to occultic spirituality, \n    so this error is now at least as prevalent as the first one. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>This is the first of three lessons \n    on Satanology: the biblical study of Satan, demons and spiritual warfare. \n    Tonight we will consider the \"career\" of Satan (origin, fall, and \n    destiny) and his overt tactics. The next two weeks will be devoted to his \n    covert tactics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3><strong><a name=\"a1\">Scripture and Satan's Existence</a></strong></h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The biblical testimony for the literal \n    existence of Satan and demons is extensive. The biblical worldview is seriously \n    incomplete without this material. We stand to suffer greatly if we do not \n    understand the reality of Satan and his efforts to attack us (I Peter 5:8,9; \n    Eph. 6:12).&#xA0; It is very dangerous to be in the midst of a war and not \n    realize it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>The Old Testament</strong><b>:</b> \n    Mentions Satan and demons less frequently than the New Testament, but its \n    testimony is clear and consistent. See Gen.&#xA0;3:1 (see also Rev.&#xA0;12:9 \n    \"the serpent of old\"); Lev.&#xA0;17:7; Deut.&#xA0;32:17; Ps.&#xA0;106:37; \n    1&#xA0;Chron.&#xA0;21:1; Job&#xA0;1,2; Zech.&#xA0;3:1,2 (Vision of Joshua \n    being accused by Satan)..</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>(<strong>Gen. 3:1</strong>) Now the serpent was\n    more crafty than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the\n    woman, \"Indeed, has God said, 'You shall not eat from any tree of the garden'?\" </p>\n    <p>(<strong>Lev. 17:7</strong>) \"And they shall\n    no longer sacrifice their sacrifices to the goat demons with which they play the harlot.\n    This shall be a permanent statute to them throughout their generations.\"' </p>\n    <p>(<strong>Deu. 32:17</strong>) \"They\n    sacrificed to demons who were not God, To gods whom they have not known, New gods who came\n    lately, Whom your fathers did not dread.</p>\n    <p><b>(Zech. 3:1-2) \n      </b>Then he showed me \n      Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan \n      standing at his right hand to accuse him.2 And the LORD said to Satan, \"The \n      LORD rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke \n      you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?\"  \n      </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Jesus Christ:</strong> Speaks more about\n  Satan and demons than any other biblical character. See for example Lk.&#xA0;4:2-13 (and\n  parallels); Mk.&#xA0;5:2-19 (and other exorcisms); Jn.&#xA0;8:44. . </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>(<strong>John 8:44</strong>) \"You are of\n    your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer\n    from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him.\n    Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature; for he is a liar, and the father\n    of lies<i>.</i></p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>The gospel authors are careful to differentiate\n      demonic activity and other sicknesses </li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><i></i><strong>(Luke 4:40-41f) </strong>And \n      while the sun was setting, all who had any who were sick with various diseases \n      brought them to Him; and laying His hands on every one of them, He was healing \n      them.(41) And demons also were coming out of many,...</p>\n    <p><b>(Matt. 4:24)</b> And the news \n      about Him went out into all Syria; and they brought to Him all who were \n      ill, taken with various diseases and pains, demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics; \n      and He healed them.</p>\n    <p><strong>(Norval Geldenhuys)</strong> \"It\n    is noteworthy that it is distinguished (especially in the gospel of the physician, Luke)\n    from cases of ordinary sickness, insanity, leprosy, blindness, lameness, deafness, and\n    other natural defects and diseases (cf., Matt.&#xA0;4:23,24; 8:16; 10:8; Mark 6:13; Luke\n    4:40; 7:21,22). . . .Neither is it only a kind of physical disease, although spiritual and\n    physical disease often accompany it (e.g. Matt 12:22, 17:15; Mark 9:18). (Norval\n    Geldenhuys, <em>Commentary of the Gospel of Luke</em>, [Grand Rapids, Mi.: Wm. B. Eerdmans\n    Publ, Co., 1998], p. 174.)</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>The rest of the New Testament:</strong>\n  also contain numerous references. Every New Testament author refers to Satan and spiritual\n  warfare (see Eph.&#xA0;1:21; Col.&#xA0;2:15; Heb.&#xA0;2:14; 1&#xA0;Pet.&#xA0;5:8-10;\n  1&#xA0;Jn.&#xA0;3:8; Jude 1:9). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><strong>(Eph. 1:21)</strong> &#x85;far above all\n    rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this\n    age, but also in the one to come. </p>\n    <p><strong>(Col. 2:15) </strong>When He had disarmed\n    the rulers and authorities, He made a public display of them, having triumphed over them\n    through Him. </p>\n    <p><strong>(Heb. 2:14)</strong>&#xA0; Since then the\n    children share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise also partook of the same, that\n    through death He might render powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the\n    devil; </p>\n    <p><strong>(1 John 3:8)</strong> &#x85;the one who\n    practices sin is of the devil; for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The Son of God\n    appeared for this purpose, that He might destroy the works of the devil. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3><strong><a name=\"a2\">Origin and Fall of Satan: \n  Ezekiel&#xA0;28 and Isaiah&#xA0;14 </a></strong></h3>\nIt is evident that the Bible does not \n  provide detailed biographical information about Satan. Yet what it does provide \n  gives us insight into his character. This is the logical beginning for understanding \n  and combating his strategies today.\n<p><b>Ezekiel 28:1-19</b></p>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Note to instructors: \n    Use this as an opportunity to teach hermeneutical principles. We need to have \n    good reasons for selecting any interpretation that breaks from the surrounding \n    context.</p>\n  <p>his is a passage that \n    we believe, in part, is about Satan. The first ten verses are parallel to \n    verses 11-19, but there are significant differences between them. We conclude \n    that the first ten verses refer to an earthly leader under God's judgment, \n    while 11-19 refers to Satan and his judgment.</p>\n  <p><b>The language of verses 1-10 gives \n    us the clues that we're not talking about Satan. </b></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>In verse 2, the passage tells us \n      we are talking about a \"leader\" of Tyre, in verse 12, we are talking \n      about a \"king of Tyre\". The distinction will be apparent in a \n      moment. </p>\n    <p>Secondly, the description of the \n      \"leader\" in verses 1-10 clearly describe the life of a human being \n      (words in <b>bold</b> font).</p>\n    <p><b>(<a name=\"a3\">Ezekiel 28:1-10</a></b>) \n      The word of the LORD came again to me saying, {2} \"Son of man, say \n      to the <b>leader of Tyre</b>, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, \"Because your \n      heart is lifted up And you have said, 'I am a god, I sit in the seat of \n      gods, In the heart of the seas'; Yet<b> you are a man and not God</b>, Although \n      you make your heart like the heart of God&#x97; </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>{3} Behold, you are wiser than Daniel; \n      There is no secret that is a match for you. {4} \"By your wisdom and \n      understanding <b>You have acquired riches</b> for yourself, And have acquired \n      gold and silver for your treasuries. {5} \"By your great wisdom, <b>by \n      your trade</b> You have increased your riches, And your heart is lifted \n      up because of your riches&#x97; </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>{6} Therefore, thus says the Lord \n      GOD, 'Because you have made your heart Like the heart of God, {7} Therefore, \n      behold, <b>I will bring strangers upon you</b>, <b>The most ruthless of \n      the nations</b>.

Note the substantial parallelism \n      between the first ten verses and the last eight.&#xA0; In both cases the \n      individual is described as the leader of Tyre, wise, wealthy, participating \n      in \"trade,\" and destroyed by God.</p>\n    <p>RESPONSE: Biblical authors often \n      refer to spiritual beings using \n      physical terminology (e.g.: Daniel 10, Ezekiel 1; commander of the Army \n      of the Lord in Joshua 5:13-15), and in fact angels sometimes take on human \n      form (Hebrews 13:2). \n      As mentioned above, there is precedence in the bible for identifying a human \n      leader with a spiritual being.<br>\n    </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><b>This passage is consistent with \n    other biblical teaching on Satan:</b></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><strong>1.&#xA0; Satan was created \n      by God (vs&#xA0;15). </strong>He is a creature who is inferior to God, so \n      there is no dualism (Col. 1:16).</p>\n    <p><strong>2.&#xA0; He is the highest \n      created being </strong>(vs 14), superior to other angels (Jude 9) and humans \n      in intellect, authority, etc. </p>\n    <p><strong>3.&#xA0; He was originally \n      perfect </strong>(vs 12,15a) as the creature of a perfect God, so God did \n      not make him evil.<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p><strong>4.&#xA0; He became evil by \n      exercising his free choice to rebel against God </strong>(vs 16) because \n      of his pride. </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>This would explain Paul's warning \n        that elder's not be \"conceited and fall into the condemnation incurred \n        by the devil\" (1&#xA0;Tim.&#xA0;3:6).

Many \n      suffer needlessly from doubt because they are too lazy to do this work. \n      <br>\n      We run the risk of suppressing our own doubts with self-soothing behavior.</p>\n    <p>Good reading: Guinness. <i>Doubt. \n      </i>Yancey<i>.

Do humans have free will to believe or reject the gospel? How \n    should we understand the New Testament's statements about election and predestination? \n    </p>\n  <p><strong>Reminder</strong>: Some weeks \n    have more immediate and obvious application than others. This is not one of \n    those weeks . . . However, there is some practical application&#x97;like the \n    implications for evangelism. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Doctrinal Overview<a name=\"a1\"></a></strong></h3>\n<b> \n</b><p><strong>Calvinism:</strong></p>\n \n<blockquote> \n  <p>This term is actually a misnomer. Calvin \n    did not emphasize predestination in his <i>Institutes</i> (only 4 chapters). \n    Calvin warned against delving too deeply into this subject (John Calvin, <i>Institutes \n    of the Christian Religion, </i>Book 3, Chapter 21, section 1). However, it \n    became the controlling principle in Reformed Theology, expressed by the Synod \n    of Dort in 1618-1619. </p>\n  <p><strong>Starting point for Calvinist/Reformed \n    theology:</strong> God is sovereign and decrees certain things.&#xA0; </p>\n  <blockquote>  \n    <p><b>(Isa. 46:10,11)</b> &#x85;My purpose will stand, and I will do all that \n      I please. (11)&#x85; What I have said, that will I bring about; what I have \n      planned, that will I do.</p>\n     </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>As a result of Adam's sin, \n    people are born in a \"depraved\" state.</strong> This means that \n    although people may do things that are good, they are constitutionally unable \n    to submit themselves to the gospel. </p>\n  <blockquote>  \n    <p><b>(Rom.&#xA0;3:11,12) &#xA0;</b>.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;there is none who \n      seeks for God; all have turned aside, together they have become useless&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;</p>\n      \n    <p><b>(John 6:44, 65)</b> No one can come to me unless the Father who sent \n      me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.....(65)And He was \n      saying, \"For this reason I have said to you, that no one can come to \n      Me, unless it has been granted him from the Father.\"</p>\n     </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Because of total depravity, \n    salvation is completely dependent on God's choice to bestow it.</strong> For \n    his own good reasons, God sovereignly chooses which individuals he will save. \n    \"Unconditional\" in this context means that there are no conditions \n    that humans must meet, including faith. Faith is a gift of God (ROM 12:3; \n    Eph. 2:8). If human-generated faith plays a part in salvation, salvation is \n    not entirely by grace. </p>\n  <blockquote>  \n    <p><b>(Eph.&#xA0;1:4,5)</b>&#xA0; He chose us in Him before the foundation \n      of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him. (5) In love \n      He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according \n      to the kind intention of His will&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;</p>\n      \n    <p><b>(1 Pet.&#xA0;2:8)</b> &#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;they stumble because \n      they are disobedient to the word, and to this doom they were also appointed.</p>\n    <p><b>(ROM&#xA0;9:16,18,22-24)</b>&#xA0; So then it does not depend on the \n      man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;(18) \n      So then He has mercy on whom He desires, and He hardens whom He desires&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;(22) \n      What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power \n      known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction? \n      (23) And He did so in order that He might make known the riches of His glory \n      upon vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory, (24) even \n      us, whom He also called, not from among Jews only, but also from among Gentiles.</p>\n     </blockquote>\n  <p>\"<strong>Double predestination</strong>\" \n    (also called reprobation) means that God predestines the elect to heaven, \n    and that he predestines the non-elect to hell (2 Thess. 2:13; 1 Pet. 2:8; \n    Jude 4; ROM 9:22,23). </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><strong>(John Calvin)</strong> \"&#x85;(God) \n      does not create everyone in the same condition, but ordains eternal life \n      for some and eternal damnation for others.\" (Cited in Alister McGrath, \n      <i>Christian Theology</i>, p. 396) </p>\n    <p>Not all Calvinists believe in double \n      predestination. Instead, they follow Augustine's teaching that God is active \n      only in the salvation of the elect, while he is passive with regard to the \n      non-elect.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Christ died for the purpose \n    of saving only the elect.</strong> Calvinists infer this from the passages \n    that say that Christ died \"for his people\" (Matt 1:21; John 10:11,15,26-27; \n    John 15:13; Acts 20:28). Since God sovereignly elected some to salvation, \n    he sent Christ to die only for them. Not all Calvinists hold to limited atonement. \n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>God's grace in salvation includes \n    imparting saving faith to the elect. </strong>This grace is irresistible since \n    it does not depend on human will (ROM 9:16; Jn. 6:37,44,65; 15:16). God causes \n    the elect to believe the gospel (Acts 13:48), even though they may not be \n    aware of this fact.</p>\n  <blockquote>  \n    <p><b>(Jn. 6:37)</b> All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me, and the \n      one who comes to Me I will certainly not cast out.</p>\n    <p><b>(Acts 13:48)</b> When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored \n      the word of the Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal life believed.</p>\n     </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Perseverance of the Saints:</strong> \n    </li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Because election depends on \n    God, those who are elected cannot lose their salvation (i.e., eternal security).</strong> \n    However, the elect will show evidence of their election by continuing to believe \n    in Christ and manifesting good works consistent with salvation (2 Pet. 1:10; \n    Heb. 3:6,14; Col. 1:23). This is the origin of \"Lordship Theology\" \n    discussed last week<a name=\"a2\"></a>. </p>\n  <blockquote>  \n    <p><b>(2 Pet.&#xA0;1:10)</b> Therefore, brethren, be all the more diligent \n      to make certain about His calling and choosing you; for as long as you practice \n      these things, you will never stumble.</p>\n    <p><b>(Heb.&#xA0;3:6,14)</b> Christ was faithful as a Son over His house whose \n      house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm \n      until the end&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;For we have become partakers of \n      Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end.</p>\n     \n    \n    <p><b>Implications for Evangelism</b></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"7\">\n  <tr> \n    <td width=\"50%\" valign=\"TOP\"> \n      <p><strong>Positive</strong> \n    </p></td>\n    <td width=\"50%\" valign=\"TOP\"> \n      <p><strong>Negative</strong> \n    </p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr> \n    <td width=\"336\" valign=\"TOP\" height=\"91\"><strong>\"Since \n      Christ has elected people to salvation, I can persevere in witnessing with \n      the confidence that I will be fruitful.\"</strong> Bill Bright, and \n      many other effective missionaries have been motivated in this way. </td>\n    <td width=\"358\" valign=\"TOP\" height=\"91\"><strong>\"If \n      God has already decided who will be saved and irresistibly calls them, does \n      it really matter whether I witness or not?\"</strong> This was the logic \n      of those who told William Carey, \"Sit down, young man!

His position was published \n    posthumously in the <i>Remonstrance </i>of 1610. </p>\n  <p><strong>Starting point for Arminian \n    theology:</strong> God wants all people to be saved. </p>\n  <blockquote>  \n    <p><b>(2 Pet. 3:9*)</b> The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count \n      slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for \n      all to come to repentance.</p>\n    <p><b>(1 Tim. 2:4)</b> (God) desires all men to be saved and to come to the \n      knowledge of the truth.</p>\n     </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Arminians agree that left to \n    themselves, people are unable to respond to the gospel. However, God in his \n    (prevenient or common) grace has enabled all people to respond to his convicting \n    influence </strong>(John 12:32; 16:8)&#x97;he has given the gift of faith \n    to everyone. </p>\n  <blockquote>  \n    <p><b>(Jn. 12:32)</b> \"And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will \n      draw all men to Myself.\"</p>\n    <p><b>(Jn. 16:8)</b> \"And He, when He comes, will convict the world concerning \n      sin, and righteousness, and judgment&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;\"</p>\n     \n    <p><strong>(Henry C. Thiessen) </strong>\"Since \n      mankind is hopelessly dead in trespasses and sins and can do nothing to \n      obtain salvation, God graciously restores to all men sufficient ability \n      to make a choice in the matter of submission to him. This is the salvation-bringing \n      grace of God that has appeared to all men.\" (Henry C. Thiessen, <i>Introductory \n      Lectures in Systematic Theology </i>[Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1949], pp. \n      344-345). </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>God's election of people to \n    salvation is conditioned upon their faith response to the gospel</strong> \n    (Eph. 1:13; ROM 3:28). Arminians reject the claim that faith is a work, since \n    faith merely receives the gift that God offers (ROM 4:4,5; Gal. 2:16). </p>\n  <blockquote>  \n    <p><b>(ROM&#xA0;4:4,5)</b> Now to the one who works, his wage is not reckoned \n      as a favor, but as what is due. (5) But to the one who does not work, but \n      believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;</p>\n     </blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Illustration:</strong> Having \n    been handed a million dollar check, the Arminians would not state that it \n    was work for you to go to the bank, endorse it, and to have it deposited into \n    your account. </p>\n  <p><strong>Both predestination and election \n    are based on God's foreknowledge (presumably) of our decision to trust Christ \n    </strong>(<b>1 Pet. 1:1,2*</b>; ROM 8:29).</p>\n  <blockquote>  \n    <p><b>(1 Pet. 1:1,2*)</b> Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who \n      reside as aliens, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, \n      and Bithynia, who are chosen (2) according to the foreknowledge of God the \n      Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, that you may obey Jesus Christ \n      and be sprinkled with His blood: May grace and peace be yours in fullest \n      measure.</p>\n    <p><b>(ROM&#xA0;8:29)</b> For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become \n      conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among \n      many brethren;</p>\n     </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Christ died for the whole human \n    race.</strong> Christ's atonement is therefore <i>sufficient</i> for all people, \n    but <i>effective</i> only for those who believe (Jn. 1:29; <b>1 Jn. 2:2*</b>; \n    2 Cor. 5:19; 1 Tim. 4:l0; Heb. 2:9). </p>\n  <blockquote>  \n    <p><b>(1&#xA0;Jn. 2:2*)</b> He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and \n      not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.</p>\n    <p><b>(2&#xA0;Cor. 5:19)</b> God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, \n      not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed to us the \n      word of reconciliation.</p>\n    <p><b>(1 Tim.&#xA0;4:10)</b> For it is for this we labor and strive, because \n      we have fixed our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, \n      especially of believers.</p>\n     </blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Illustration (continued):</strong> \n    The above check is sufficient to cover your debt, but you must deposit it \n    to your account. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>It is God's will that all people \n    be saved </strong>(1 Tim. 2:4; <b>2 Pet 3:9*</b>; Ezek. 18:23). Therefore, \n    God in his grace draws all people to himself (Jn. 12:32; 16:8). But scripture \n    clearly teaches that <strong>humans are capable of resisting God's will</strong> \n    (Mt. 23:37; Heb. 4:2; Lk. 7:29,30). </p>\n  <blockquote>  \n    <p><b>(Matt.&#xA0;23:37)</b> \"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets \n      and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your \n      children together, the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and \n      you were unwilling.\"</p>\n    <p><b>(Luke 7:29,30)</b> And when all the people and the tax-gatherers heard \n      this, they acknowledged God's justice, having been baptized with the baptism \n      of John. (30) But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected God's purpose for \n      themselves, not having been baptized by John.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Present Assurance of Salvation: \n    </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Most Arminians do not believe in eternal\n       security.&#xA0; Like John Wesley, they believe that we can have present\n       experiential  assurance of our salvation&#x97;but that we could lose our\n       salvation for various reasons. This was evidently Arminius' view\n       as well.  <strong>However, it is neither logically nor biblically necessary\n        for Arminians to reject eternal security.</strong> In\n        Xenos, we hold a moderately  Arminian position while also believing in\n        eternal security.</p>\n  <blockquote> <b> \n    </b><p>Implications for Evangelism</p>\n     </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"7\">\n  <tr> \n    <td width=\"50%\" valign=\"TOP\"> \n      <p><strong>Positive</strong> \n    </p></td>\n    <td width=\"50%\" valign=\"TOP\"> \n      <p><strong>Negative</strong> \n    </p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr> \n    <td valign=\"TOP\">\"I am motivated to share \n      my faith because I know that more will be saved if I am faithful as Christ's \n      ambassador.\" <strong>The logic of Arminianism makes it easy for Christians \n      to believe that evangelism is both a privilege and a responsibility. </strong></td>\n    <td width=\"385\" valign=\"TOP\" height=\"138\">\"Evangelism \n      is a heavy burden since my friend's salvation depends on my witness.\" \n      <strong>Arminians need to be careful to fully emphasize God's will and non-Christians' \n      responsibility as they evangelize.</strong> Unless we remember this, we \n      can become unhealthily anxious, taking on more responsibility for people's \n      salvation than is rightfully ours.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><b>*Note to teachers: \n    </b>This lecture has been changed recently \n    from being devoted entirely to the Calvinism-Arminianism debate.

Personal \n        salvation is not in view in the original passage (Ex. 33:19). </p>\n      <p><strong>Vs. 18</strong> is in the \n        context of vs. 16 (see above) and vs. 17, which refers to God's <i>temporal \n        </i>destruction of the Egyptians when they wanted to destroy Israel. The \n        verse teaches that God caused his choice of Israel to stand regardless \n        of Moses' attempts to help or Pharaoh's attempts to hinder. <i>Neither \n        Moses' nor Pharaoh's personal salvation was in view in these passages.</i> \n        </p>\n      <p><strong>Vss. 21-23</strong> refer \n        to <i>nations </i>which have either a glorious or judgmental role in history. \n        Two interpretations are possible:</p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p><strong>God allows evil nations \n          to exist and often uses them to bless the chosen nation Israel.</strong> \n          Today, believers are able to participate in the covenant blessings of \n          Israel because they have been \"grafted into the rich root\" \n          of God's purpose in history. </p>\n        <p><strong>Another explanation is \n          that the \"lump of clay\" in vs. 21 refers to national Israel. \n          </strong>God has the right to divide Israel into two vessels: unbelieving \n          Israel, which has become a <i>\"vessel of wrath prepared </i>(\"fit\" \n          or \"suited\") <i>for destruction,\" </i>and believing Israel \n          which, along with Gentile believers, has become a <i>\"vessel of \n          mercy.\" </i></p>\n      </blockquote>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Any interpretation \n      of Rom. 9 must account for the transition<b> </b>that Paul makes from national \n      choice in vss. 1-24 and individual salvation in vss. 24-33. Therefore, neither \n      view can claim that the other is completely out of context. The question \n      becomes one of which transition is more believable, and makes the most sense \n      of the Old Testament quotations. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><b>(Gal. 1:15,1</b><strong>6)</strong> \n    But when He who had set me apart, even from my mother's womb, and called me \n    through His grace, was pleased to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach \n    Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood \n    . . . </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><strong>Calvinists</strong> interpret \n      this passage to mean that <strong>God irresistibly called Paul because he \n      was elected to salvation</strong>. They further argue that Paul's salvation \n      is typical of all Christians in this regard. </p>\n    <p><strong>Arminians </strong>would \n      point out that Paul's election and calling were based on God's foreknowledge \n      of Paul's decision to believe. Some Arminians acknowledge that Paul may \n      have been unconditionally elected and irresistibly called by God, but point \n      out that this does not prove that God deals with all people in this way. \n      There is no reason to think that God cannot deal with some people differently \n      than others. Arminians would argue that <strong>the burden is on the Calvinist \n      to demonstrate not just that God elected someone unconditionally, but that \n      he elects all Christians in this way. </strong></p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><b>(Eph. 1:4,5</b><strong>)</strong> \n    . . . just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that \n    we should be holy and blameless before Him.

Rom. 8:23 for Paul's use of \"adoption\"<i> \n        </i>in this way). </p>\n      <p>Arminians also insist that <strong>God's \n        election and predestination are based on his foreknowledge of our choice \n        to believe in Christ</strong> (1 Pet. 1:1,2*; Rom. 8:29). </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><b>(2 Thess. 2:1</b><strong>3)</strong> \n    But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, \n    because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification \n    by the Spirit and faith in the truth. </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><strong>Calvinists</strong> interpret \n      this passage to teach <strong>unconditional election</strong>. </p>\n    <p><strong>Arminians</strong><i> </i>point \n      out that \"from the beginning\" could refer to the beginning of \n      their Christian lives (i.e., conversion). Paul uses this same phrase in \n      Phil. 4:15 to refer to people's conversion. <strong>If the term \"salvation\" \n      refers to glorification (see vs. 14) or spiritual maturity (1 Thess. 5:23), \n      Paul is simply reminding them of God's purpose for their lives. </strong></p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><b>(1 Pet. 2:8) </b>. . . and, \"A \n    STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE\"; for they stumble because they \n    are disobedient to the word, and to this doom they were also appointed. </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><strong>Some Calvinists </strong>find \n      support for double-predestination in this passage. <strong>God appointed \n      certain people to \"doom\" and therefore they rejected Christ. </strong></p>\n    <p><strong>Arminians</strong> point \n      out that the specific cause for their stumbling is not God, but that <i>\"they \n      are disobedient to the word.\" </i>Peter is not saying that God made \n      them disobey, or that they cannot repent. He is simply saying that <strong>God \n      has ordained judgment for those who reject the gospel. </strong></p>\n    \n  </blockquote>\n  <p><b>(Jude 1:4) </b>For certain persons \n    have crept in unnoticed, those who were long beforehand marked out for this \n    condemnation, ungodly persons who turn the grace of our God into licentiousness \n    and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ. </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><strong>Calvinists</strong> hold \n      that this passage teaches <strong>double-predestination</strong>.

Other passages clearly teach that God sovereignly decides \n    what spiritual gifts we get (1&#xA0;Cor.&#xA0;12:11), and our specific ministry \n    callings (Gal.&#xA0;1:15,16). </p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Remember that this is not \n    an essential doctrinal issue.</strong> </li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Christians should not break fellowship \n    with one another over whether they are Arminian or Calvinist. We use many \n    excellent theological texts that are written by Calvinists (e.g., Millard \n    Erickson, <i>Christian Theology</i>). It is instructive that Francis Schaeffer \n    makes no mention of this issue in any of his many books. Commitment to the \n    work of evangelism and missions is more important than one's position on this \n    issue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Memory Verses</strong></h3>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><strong>1 Peter 1:1b-2* -</strong> \n    Election is based on God's foreknowledge (evidently of who chooses to believe \n    in Christ). </p>\n  <p><strong>1 John 2:2* - </strong>Jesus \n    Christ died for the sins of the whole world, not just of believers. </p>\n  <p><strong>2 Peter 3:9* -</strong> God's \n    will is for all people to be saved. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Assignment</strong></h3>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Read Revelation 19:11-21:8, and draw \n    a timeline that locates each of these events in the order that John describes \n    them.</p>\n  <p>Read the historical background material \n    for Daniel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Selected Bibliography</strong></h3>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Berkhof, Louis. <i>Systematic Theology</i>. \n    Grand Rapids: Eerdmans Publishing, pp. 415-549.

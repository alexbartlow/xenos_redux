There is an immense amount of biblical material to correlate, \n    and because of this there is some disagreement on some of the details. We \n    want to get the main picture tonight. </p>\n \n  <blockquote> \n    <p><b>There's lots of prophetic material associated with the final days. \n      </b>We won't be able to address every question or show how prediction \n      fits. </p>\n    <p><b>We assume you have done your homework assignment</b>, so we \n      will only allude to (rather than cover) the passages involved in many of \n      these end-times events. </p>\n    <p><b>See the Old Testament and New Testament prophecy charts&#x97;they \n      help to correlate this material.</b> See also J. Dwight Pentecost, \n      <i>Things To Come</i> and John Walvoord, <i>Daniel: The Key To Prophetic \n      Revelation</i> for solid Dispensational treatments. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n \n  <p><b>We will use the Olivet Discourse (Matt. 24:1-31**) as our anchor \n    text.</b> While it doesn't cover all the events, it is the most comprehensive \n    passage concerning the end times. </p>\n \n  <blockquote> \n    <p>The disciples actually ask three questions because they assumed that the \n      destruction of the Temple would herald the end of the age. Actually, the \n      Temple was destroyed in 70 AD, while Jesus' coming and the end of the age \n      has obviously not yet occurred. </p>\n    <p>Matthew only records Jesus' response to the disciples' last two questions. \n      Luke&#xA0;21:20-24 records his answer to their first question. Jesus answers \n      the question about the sign of \"end\" in Matt. 24:15, and the question \n      about the sign of his coming in Matt. 24:30.</p>\n    \n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/timeline_premill.gif\" width=\"640\"></p>\n<h3><a name=\"a2\"></a><b>The Church Age </b></h3>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><b>The entire period from the death of Christ through the Rapture is called \n    a \"mystery\" because it was not clearly revealed in the Old Testament.</b>&#xA0; \n    (Rom. 11:25) The Old Testament prophets did not understand that God would \n    temporarily suspend his work through Israel and instead work through the church \n    to bring the news of salvation to all people-groups. Jesus calls this period \n    \"the times of the Gentiles\" (Lk. 21:24). The Church receives a partial, \n    unforeseen fulfillment of the New Covenant. Therefore, virtually all of our \n    information about the Church Age comes from the New Testament. </p>\n  <p>The Matt. 13 parables describe the \"mysteries of the kingdom\"&#x97;the \n    portion of God's kingdom which was not revealed in the Old Testament (Church \n    Age). While affirming that the kingdom will come in its fullness as predicted \n    by the Old Testament prophets, Jesus explains several key contrasts between \n    the Church Age and the Millennial Kingdom.

Christ will descend from heaven to catch \n      up all living and dead believers to meet him in the air. They receive their \n      resurrected bodies at this point. Therefore, <b>some Christians will never \n      experience physical death</b>. Instead, they will be instantly translated \n      like Enoch and Elijah in the Old Testament. </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p><b>(1&#xA0;Thess. 4:16,17)</b> For the Lord himself will come down from \n        heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with \n        the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. (17) \n        After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together \n        with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be \n        with the Lord forever.</p>\n      <p><b>(1&#xA0;Cor.&#xA0;15:50-53)</b> I declare to you, brothers, that flesh \n        and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit \n        the imperishable. (51) Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, \n        but we will all be changed&#x97;(52) in a flash, in the twinkling of an \n        eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be \n        raised imperishable, and we will be changed. (53) For the perishable must \n        clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><b>Why is it called the \"Rapture?\" &#xA0; </b></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>This word is not found in the bible, but is derived from the Latin verb \n      <em>rapere </em>for \"seized\" or \"caught up\".&#xA0; We see this type of formulation \n      in 1 Thes. 4:17.</p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p><b>(1 Thes. 4:<small>17)</small></b><small> Then we who are alive and \n        remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the \n        Lord in the air, and thus we shall always be with the Lord.</small><br>\n      </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><b>When will it occur?</b></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><b>None of the Rapture passages directly speak about the timing of the \n      Rapture in relation to the Second Advent.</b> Its timing must therefore \n      be inferred from other eschatological passages. <i>The key issue here is \n      how one understands God's commitment to Israel.&#xA0; If God's covenants \n      with Israel still stand, then the focus of God's dealing during the tribulation \n      will be with Israel. </i></p>\n    <p><b>Covenantalists:</b></p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p><b>Because Covenantalists see the Church replacing Israel, they see the \n        Rapture as the first event of the Second Coming</b> (POST-TRIBULATIONAL \n        VIEW). </p>\n      <p><b>Parousia: </b>The word <i>parousia</i> (\"coming\"), which \n        is repeatedly used to refer to the second coming of Christ, has a special \n        meaning in some cases. When a general staged a triumphal entry into a \n        city, the citizens would go out to meet him, and immediately return in \n        company with him and his army and/or captives. This could be the intended \n        meaning of the word when it is used in passages like 1 Thess. 4:15; 1 \n        Cor. 15:23. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><b>Dispensationalist: </b></p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p><b>Because Dispensationalists see the Church as a parenthesis in God's \n        working through Israel, they see the Rapture as a distinct event separated \n        by a period of time</b> (PRE- or MID-TRIBULATIONAL VIEWS - the distinction \n        between these views is minor).

They still die, though after a longer life (Isa. \n    65:20,21), therefore they have mortal bodies. They are evidently still fallen, \n    as inferred from various judgments and the fact that they die. They have children \n    (Isa. 65:23) and repopulate the earth (inferred from Rev. 20:8). The curse \n    on nature is evidently ameliorated removed to some extent (Isa. 65:25). </p>\n  <p><b>Satan is bound in the abyss for most of this period</b>, which \n    lasts for 1000 years (Rev. 20:2,3,4,5,6,7). </p>\n  <p><b>Satan is released at the end of this period and incites a rebellion \n    against Jesus, at which time he is thrown into hell.</b> This evidently \n    demonstrates that the problem with humans is not environmental, but moral \n    and spiritual. Even in a perfect environment and a perfectly just government, \n    humans still revolt. It is also probably the final piece of evidence for Satan's \n    condemnation. </p>\n  <p><b>Jesus rules from Jerusalem</b> (Obadiah 1:12-20; Zech. 14:16). \n    Gentiles come to Jerusalem to worship the Lord (Zech. 14:16-21). Jews have \n    a new temple and offer commemorative sacrifices there (Ezek. 40-48). Resurrected \n    believers may participate in the administration of the messianic kingdom (Matt. \n    19:28-30; Rev. 20:4)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><b><a name=\"a10\">The Great White Throne Judgment</a> </b></h3>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><b>(Rev.&#xA0;20:11-15)</b> And I saw a great white throne and Him who sat \n    upon it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was \n    found for them. (12) And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing \n    before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which \n    is the book of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written \n    in the books, according to their deeds. (13) And the sea gave up the dead \n    which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; \n    and they were judged, every one of them according to their deeds. (14) And \n    death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, \n    the lake of fire. (15) And if anyone's name was not found written in the book \n    of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire. </p>\n  <p><b>Who is judged at the judgment?</b></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><b>This judgment is evidently for all unsaved people of all times.</b></p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><b>Why are the people condemned?</b> </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li> \n      <p><b>Their names do not appear in the book of life. That is, they did not \n        respond to God's offer of forgiveness through Christ. </b></p>\n    </li>\n    <li> \n      <p><b>Their works reveal that they deserve God's judgment, because they \n        fall short of God's standard of moral perfection. </b></p>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><b>What is their fate?</b></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><b>The unsaved dead are then sentenced to the lake of fire (also called \n      \"hell,\" \"Gehenna,\" \"the outer darkness,\" \"eternal \n      fire,\" etc.). </b></p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p><b>(2 Thess. 1:9)</b> And these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, \n        away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><b>Hell is a place of eternal, conscious alienation from God and condemnation \n      </b>(Matt. 25:46; 2 Thes. 1:9; Rev. 14:9-11; Jude 1:7). The Bible does not \n      support the idea that the unsaved are eventually annihilated after being \n      punished for a period of time (conditional immortality). </p>\n    <p>There are evidently degrees of punishment in hell. <b>People will be punished \n      differently according to how much they knew of God's will</b> (see Mark \n      12:40; Lk. 20:46-48). </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><b><a name=\"a11\"></a>The New Heavens &amp; New Earth </b></h3>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote>\n    <p><b>(Rev.&#xA0;21:1-8)</b> And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the \n      first heaven and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer any \n      sea. (2) And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven \n      from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband. (3) And I heard \n      a loud voice from the throne, saying, \"Behold, the tabernacle of God \n      is among men, and He shall dwell among them, and they shall be His people, \n      and God Himself shall be among them, (4) and He shall wipe away every tear \n      from their eyes; and there shall no longer be any death; there shall no \n      longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed \n      away.\" (5) And He who sits on the throne said, \"Behold, I am making \n      all things new.\" And He said, \"Write, for these words are faithful \n      and true.\" (6) And He said to me, \"It is done. I am the Alpha \n      and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to the one who thirsts \n      from the spring of the water of life without cost. (7) \"He who overcomes \n      shall inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son. \n      (8) \"But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers \n      and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part \n      will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second \n      death.\"</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><b>This is the eternal state. God destroys our present universe </b>(Rev. \n    21:1; 2 Pet. 3:10-13) <b>and creates a new universe in which his reign endures \n    forever</b> (Rev. 21:1-22:5). </p>\n  <p>How can God give people free will in this state and yet guarantee that there \n    will never be a rebellion again? Part of the answer may be that we will be \n    able to see the complete record of revolt against God, the full demonstration \n    that only he has the right to rule (Isa. 66:24). </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><b><a name=\"a6\"></a>The Intermediate States </b></h3>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><b>Where do people go after they die, but before their eternal states?</b> \n    Are they conscious or not? These are the questions most people have about \n    the intermediate state. There is not a lot of material on this subject, but \n    we can infer what might happen. </p>\n  <p><b>Believers are divided into two groups: </b></p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><b>Those who died before Christ's death</b> went to a waiting place which \n      Jesus called \"Abraham's Bosom\" (Lk. 16:22). They were conscious \n      and comforted. They evidently could not go into God's presence because their \n      sins had not yet been paid for in history. \n      <blockquote> \n        <p><b>(Luke 16:22)</b> \"The time came when the beggar died and the \n          angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was \n          buried.\"</p>\n      </blockquote>\n    </li>\n    <li><b>Those who die after Christ's death</b> go directly to be consciously \n      with Christ in heaven (2 Cor. 5:8; Phil. 1:23; Lk. 23:43). However, they \n      do not receive their resurrected bodies until the Rapture (1 Cor. 15:52). \n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p><b>(Luke 23:43)</b> Jesus answered him, \"I tell you the truth, today \n        you will be with me in paradise.\"</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><b>Therefore, the New Testament refers to dead Christians as \"asleep\" \n      not because they are unconscious, but to emphasize that they will be raised \n      from the dead just as a sleeping person will awaken</b> (<i>contra</i> \"SOUL \n      SLEEP\"). </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><b>Nonbelievers:</b></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Nonbelievers evidently go to a waiting place Jesus called \"Hades\"</b> \n      (Lk. 16:23). They are conscious and in agony&#x97;probably because they \n      are aware of their coming judgment. They will be raised at the end of the \n      Millennial Kingdom to be judged and sentenced to hell (Rev. 20:11-15). </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p><b>(Luke 16:23)</b> \"And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in \n        torment, and saw Abraham far away, and Lazarus in his bosom.</p>\n      <p><b>(Rev. 20:13,14)</b> The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and \n        death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was \n        judged according to what he had done.

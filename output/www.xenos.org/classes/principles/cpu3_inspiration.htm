As Christians, our view of the Bible \n    rests on the authority of Christ. The Bible claims that Jesus is God incarnate. \n    Jesus claims that of himself (John 8:58; 10:30-33). If this is true, then \n    what he has to say about the Bible should carry the ultimate authority in \n    establishing our views about Scripture. <i>Does Christ view scripture as inspired \n    and authoritative?</i> </p>\n  <p><strong>a.&#xA0; What was Christ's view of the Old \n    Testament? </strong> </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Matt. 5:17,18* \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or \n      the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. I tell \n      you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, \n      not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law \n      until everything is accomplished. </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Jesus says the Old Testament is eternally authoritative down to the very \n        <i>letters</i> used. </p>\n      <p>In Matthew 22:22-32, Jesus draws attention to the tense of the verb \"to \n        be\" to prove the resurrection from the dead.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>John 10:35,36 \"If he called them 'gods,' to whom the word of God came&#x97;and \n      <i>the Scripture cannot be broken</i>&#x97;what about the one whom the Father \n      set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse \n      me of blasphemy because I said, 'I am God's Son'?\" </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Jesus is responding to the Jews' charge of blasphemy because he said \n        \"I and the Father are one.\" Citing Ps. 82:6, in which God called \n        people \"gods\" (<i>elohim</i>), Jesus argues (<i>a fortiori</i>) \n        that if it is appropriate for humans to be called \"gods,\" how \n        much more appropriate is it for him (as the Son of God) to refer to himself \n        as \"one with the Father.\" </p>\n      <p>Notice that Jesus views the entire Old Testament, even seemingly incidental \n        statements, as incapable of error. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Mark 7:5-13 \"You have let go of the commands of God and are holding \n      on to the traditions of men . . . Thus you nullify the word of God by your \n      tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that.\" \n    </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Jesus viewed the Old Testament in a totally different category than religious \n        tradition. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p> Jesus affirmed the historicity of Old Testament characters and events. \n      See also Matthew 12:38-40 [Jonah]; Matthew 19:4-5 [creation of Adam and \n      Eve]; Luke 17:26-32 [Noah]; Luke 20:37 [call of Moses]; John 3:14 [Moses/serpent \n      in wilderness]. </p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION: Jesus Christ quoted and viewed the Old Testament as the authoritative \n      word of God. What the Old Testament said, God said. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><strong>b.&#xA0; What is Christ's perspective of his \n    own words? </strong> \n  </p><blockquote> \n    <p>Matt. 24:35\"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never \n      pass away.\" \n    </p><blockquote> \n      <p>Notice the deliberate parallelism to Matt. 5:18. Jesus is consciously \n        equating the authority of his own words to that of the Old Testament. \n      </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Matt. 7:24-27 \"Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and \n      puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. \n      The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against \n      that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. \n      But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice \n      is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain came down, the \n      streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell \n      with a great crash.\" </p>\n    <p>John 12:48 \"There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not \n      accept my words; that very word which I spoke will condemn him at the last \n      day.\" \n    </p><blockquote> \n      <p>In both of these passages, Jesus claims that people's eternal destiny \n        will be decided by how they respond to his words (see also Jn. 5:24). \n      </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>John 8:31,32 To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, \"If you \n      hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the \n      truth, and the truth will set you free.\" \n    </p><blockquote> \n      <p>Notice that Jesus regards his teaching as \"the truth\" which \n        is capable of setting people free from sin. Old Testament passages like \n        Ps. 119 make similar claims for the word of God. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p> NOTE: Old Testament prophets' \"Thus said the Lord\" is similar \n      to Jesus' \"Truly I say to you\".&#xA0; This would have been heard \n      loud and clear by his audience as a statement of divine authority.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION: Jesus viewed his own words as divinely authoritative. What \n      Jesus said, God said. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><strong>c.&#xA0; What was Jesus' view of his apostles' \n    writings? </strong> \n  </p><blockquote> \n    <p>Matt. 10:40* \"He who receives you receives me, and he who receives \n      me receives the one who sent me . . . \" \n    </p><blockquote> \n      <p>Notice how similar this statement is to John 12:48 (see above). Jesus \n        is the Father's authoritative spokesman, so that to reject his words is \n        to reject the Father. So also the apostles (the original audience in this \n        passage) are his authoritative spokesmen, so that to reject their words \n        is to reject Jesus and the Father. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Jesus promised the apostles that the Holy Spirit would enable them to speak \n      for him. In other words, the Holy Spirit would inspire their words. \n    </p><blockquote> \n      <p>John 14:26 \"But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father \n        will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of \n        everything I have said to you.\" </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>The Holy Spirit gave them supernatural recall of Jesus' words and the ability \n      to interpret Jesus' life and death. </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>John 15:26,27 \"When the Counselor comes, whom I will send to you \n        from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father, he \n        will testify about me. And you also must testify, for you have been with \n        me from the beginning.\" </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>The Holy Spirit gave them the authority to \"bear witness\" (provide \n      legal testimony) concerning Jesus. </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>John 16:13 \"But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide \n        you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what \n        he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.\" </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>The Holy Spirit would enable them to interpret Jesus' coming death and \n      resurrection, and to prophesy concerning the future (e.g., John in Revelation). \n    </p>\n    <p>Who were the Apostles? Jesus' original twelve disciples, minus Judas, plus \n      Matthias (Acts 1:26), plus Paul (Gal. 1:1) and James the Lord's brother \n      (Gal.&#xA0;1:19), were given apostolic authority. </p>\n    <p>The New Testament speaks of many others as being \"apostles\" in \n      a more generic sense, but it refers to this special class of \"Capital \n      A\" apostles as uniquely authoritative (generic: Phil. 2:25; 2 Cor. \n      8:23; probably Rom. 16:7 cf. 2 Cor. 12:12). (<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu2w9.htm\">See Unit \n      #2 Week #9</a>) .</p>\n    <p>{There was no apostolic succession, contrary to Roman Catholicism's doctrine \n      of papal authority. One had to have witnessed the resurrection to be an \n      Apostle (1&#xA0;Cor. 9:1), and Paul was the \"last of all\" to have \n      witnessed the resurrected Christ (1 Cor. 15:8).}</p>\n    <p>Many passages <b>corroborate</b> Jesus' teaching about the authority of \n      the apostles' writings: </p>\n    <p><i>The authors claim that their own writings are inspired and authoritative. \n      </i></p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <p>1 Cor. 14:37 \"If anybody thinks he is a prophet or spiritually \n          gifted, let him acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's \n          command.\" </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>1 Thess. 2:13 \"And we also thank God continually because, when \n          you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted \n          it not as the word of men, but as it actually is, the word of God, which \n          is at work in you who believe.\" </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>1 Jn. 4:4-6 \"You (his Christian audience), dear children, are \n          from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater \n          than the one who is in the world.

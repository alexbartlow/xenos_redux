See Eph. 6.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><a name=\"a2\">Division</a> </strong></p>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><b>Definition:</b> Division \n    is personal alienation between Christians (especially workers*) caused by \n    sinful attitudes. It is rooted in attitudes like envy, pride, and selfish \n    ambition (Jas. 3:14-16), and it manifests itself in relationships broken by \n    unresolved anger, personal resentment, malice, bitterness, etc. (Eph. 4:26,27,31). \n    This is what causes \"demonic\" disorder and \"gives the devil \n    opportunity\" to set Christians against one another and ravage the church \n    . . . </p>\n  <p>* A worker is a Christian who is committed \n    to advancing God's kingdom by sharing their faith with people who don't know \n    Christ, by cooperating with God as He transforms their character, and by helping \n    other believers move forward in their relationship with God.</p>\n  <p>Scripture emphasizes unity <strong>among \n    coworkers </strong>rather than organizational unity between denominations \n    or functional cooperation between local churches.</p>\n  <p><b>Purpose:</b> \n    \"Divide and conquer\" - Satan understands better than we do the importance \n    of the church in spiritual warfare. As long as we are united, we will be effective \n    (Roman Maniple; John 17:20-21;Matt. 12:25; Eph.&#xA0;4:1-3; Col.&#xA0;2:5 \n    - \"ordered array\"). But if he can get the workers filled with suspicion, \n    selfish ambition and negativity toward each other, or if he can discredit \n    leaders, he can have a heyday (<em><strong>Home church failures' common factor</strong></em>; \n    <em><strong>1993 Xenos Division </strong></em>- up to 1200 people lost). </p>\n  <b> \n  </b><p>Results of division: </p>\n   \n  <blockquote> \n    <p>If you have ever been through \n      a nasty division (like the one we experienced in 1992-1994), then you know \n      how destructive it is. </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><i>It destroys effective \n        outreach, because a key to our witness is the love that we show toward \n        each other</i> (Jn. 13:34; 17:23). If people see the same kind of alienation \n        between Christians that they see elsewhere, why should they listen to \n        our message?</li>\n      <li><i>It demoralizes and demotivates \n        all who are involved in it</i>. It is terrifically draining to be in an \n        environment of suspicion, resentment and hostility (LIKE A DIVORCE). Some \n        often drop out of fellowship altogether, and then become isolated and \n        neutralized. Even seasoned workers who persevere through it flag in their \n        zeal, and may become unwilling to risk getting close to people again.</li>\n      <li><i>It prevents effective \n        leadership.</i> If a significant group becomes divided from the leadership \n        of the church, or worse if the leadership itself becomes divided, the \n        work of the church comes to a halt. Leaders must supply clear direction \n        for the church, and the people must trust and respond to their leadership--or \n        we are a rabble. <br>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><b>Avenues</b>: \n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Passive division:</b> \n      Workers are disengaged, not initiating consistent encouragement and appropriate \n      admonition.

Is this a terrible defeat? There \n            is no hint in Luke's narrative that it was. They couldn't agree on \n            personnel, so they split into two mission teams, divided the mission, \n            and went on. In his letters, Paul speaks favorably of both Barnabas \n            and Mark in his later letters.</p>\n        </blockquote>\n        <p>We have issues-oriented conflicts in this \n          church.

Division \n            is almost always preceded by relational passivity and disengagement. \n            It is difficult for the enemy to sow division between people who are \n            consistently and consciously praying for, encouraging, and having \n            fun with one another. How are you doing here? Are you making time \n            for this? Are you focusing on initiating it yourself and giving freely \n            instead of on how well others are doing this with you?</li>\n          <li><i>You can work together \n            on reaching outward to others</i> (Phil. 1:27; 2:2). When we are linking \n            arms to reach out to those who don't know Christ and to help new Christians \n            learn how to walk with Christ, we will be largely immune to division. \n            But if we selfishly become a \"holy huddle,\" it won't be \n            long before we begin to get offended by one another's idiosyncrasies \n            and minor offenses. Leaders, are you setting an outward direction \n            and tone for your groups? Members, are you taking ownership to play \n            your part in reaching out to other people?<br>\n            </li>\n          <li><i>You can maintain a \n            proper attitude toward your leaders</i> (1 Tim. 5:19; Heb. 13:17; \n            1 Thess. 5:12,13 SEE LINKAGE B/W THIS ATTITUDE TOWARD LEADERS AND \n            \"LIVING IN PEACE\" WITH ONE ANOTHER). Satan works especially \n            hard to divide people from their spiritual leaders because he knows \n            that if he can alienate the sheep from their shepherds, he can ravage \n            the flock. This is why the New Testament, while holding high moral \n            standards for leaders and circumscribing their legitimate sphere of \n            authority, also calls on non-leaders to respect them, be prepared \n            to follow them, and reject accusations against them unless they are \n            objective and serious. Do you have this attitude toward your leaders--or \n            do you indulge the freedom to resist them and sabotage them and suspect \n            them? </li>\n        </ul>\n        <blockquote> \n          <p>The above preventative \n            steps set the tone for the entire group.<b><br>\n            </b></p>\n        </blockquote>\n        <p><b>2. Early Detection: <br>\n          </b>The statistics \n          are overwhelming that early detection is often the difference between \n          life and death. It is so much easier to \"nip it in the bud\" \n          than to get rid of it once it has spread. The same thing is true with \n          division in the church. Because our enemy is creatively active and because \n          we are fallen, sinful people, we will not be able to prevent all division \n          by the above steps. But we can nip it in the bud by taking the following \n          steps: <br>\n          </p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Like all sin, it always \n            starts in our thought-lives--so <i>we need to develop the habit of \n            monitoring our thoughts about others.</i> Satan will insidiously slander \n            your Christian friends and leaders to you, drawing your attention \n            to and exaggerating their flaws and weaknesses, interpreting their \n            offenses against you in the worst possible light, and judging their \n            motives (1 Cor. 4:5 - that they don't really care about you or are \n            out hold you back or even to get you; they are committed to self rather \n            than to Christ, etc.). Do you practice suspicion toward your suspicions \n            by judging them and rejecting them? Or do you pour gasoline on the \n            fire by indulging them and speaking them to others (\"Don't say \n            behind their backs what you'd be embarrassed to say to their faces.\")? \n            Once you do this, you give Satan more room to operate . . . <br>\n            Beware of taking up the offense of another (Prov. 26:17; 3:30). True \n            Spirituality involves this practice, which no one sees, of being strict \n            about your thought life&#x2026;</li>\n          <li><i>We also need to help \n            one another in this area. </i>When we see evidence that they are tolerating \n            these kinds of groundless, slanderous thoughts, we need to speak an \n            objective, corrective word and call on them to get before God about \n            this! This is a really key ministry for all of us! In a disengaged \n            church, this is not seen or practiced.<b><br>\n            </b></li>\n        </ul>\n        <p><b>3. Aggressive Treatment<br>\n          </b></p>\n        <p>Once cancer has begun to \n          grow and spread, it is life threatening. Only immediate and aggressive \n          treatment can catch it before it rages out of control. In the same way, \n          the New Testament gives us strong directives to take aggressive action \n          when division actually breaks out. This is not a formula, but the Holy \n          Spirit will guide you on how to apply these directives.<br>\n          </p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><i>You should try to \n            talk out personal conflicts as soon as you become aware of them</i> \n            (Matt. 5:23,24). If you know you are divided from another Christian, \n            don't withdraw and slander him to others--go and talk it out, and \n            be ready to listen to his response instead of being dogmatic about \n            your interpretation. What if you hear that he is divided from you? \n            Sure, he should be coming to you--but there is a higher priority here \n            than conflict etiquette! Go and ask what you have done to offend him.</li>\n          <li><i>You should apologize \n            where appropriate--even if not reciprocated </i>(Matt. 7:3-5). Instead \n            of being defensive, ask God to show you your fault. And if he shows \n            you, acknowledge it and ask forgiveness. If you have slandered him, \n            go and correct it. What is more important to you--preserving unity \n            or your own pride?</li>\n          <li><i>You should be willing \n            to forbear and forgive--even of he does not reciprocate</i> (Col. \n            3:13). Division thrives and grows when both parties are unwilling \n            to do this. But when even one party chooses to do this, the damage \n            is usually greatly reduced. This means committing yourself to pray \n            for them and do good to them as the Lord shows you how to do this. \n            Are you doing this--or are you reserving the right to withdraw and \n            retaliate until they respond the way you insist on? <br>\n            Are you willing to call upon your friends to do these things? To demand \n            that in a certain amount of time&#x2026; <br>\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>SOMETIMES THESE ADDITIONAL \n          MEASURES ARE NECESSARY:<br>\n          </p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>You should ask for help \n            from others if necessary (Phil. 4:2,3). Sometimes we need the objectivity \n            and wisdom of another mature Christian in order to resolve our issues \n            and hurt feelings. I've seen stalemated parties break down in humility \n            and tears and get reconciled when they have been willing to get this \n            kind of help. Is this what you need to do (HOME GROUP WORKERS; COUNSELORS; \n            HOME GROUP OVERSEERS; ARBITRATION BOARD).</li>\n        </ul>\n        <ul>\n          <li> Formal church discipline \n            is appropriate for unrepentant divisive members (2 Tim. 2:26; Titus \n            3:10). In those few cases in which someone insists on spreading discord \n            in the church, God calls on us to correct him, warn him, publicly \n            expose his rumors--and even to remove him until he repents. Are you \n            willing to practice this \"tough love.\"</li>\n        </ul>\n      </blockquote>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <p><strong>Remember:</strong> <strong>You'll \n        never stop all divisive conflict in the church. </strong></p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>The key is to promote and model \n          unity, and go about dealing with it in a godly way.

Suffering \n    prepares us for bearing fruit.</p>\n  <p>One key way by which we grow is to \n    build up the inner man (we wiill explain in context of Walking by the Spirit \n    in <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu2w8.htm\">Week #8</a>). As we take the initiative to do this, \n    we are able to affect others spiritually.</p>\n  <p>But there is still the problem of the \n    \"outer man\" (2 Cor. 4:7-16)--the flesh, or sin-nature. Building \n    up the \"inner man\" doesn't really affect it. For this problem, God \n    has another outward process by which our outer man is broken down so that \n    the life of Christ can be released.</p>\n  <p>This is the primary role of suffering \n    in the Christian life (2 Cor 1:8,9), and we will not get beyond a primitive \n    level of spiritual maturity unless we learn this truth and respond properly. \n    Christians who don't understand and respond to suffering in a Biblical fashion \n    often \"bail out!\" </p>\n  <blockquote>  \n    <p><b>(2 Cor. 4:7-12)</b> But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show \n      that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us. (8) We are hard \n      pressed. . .perplexed. . . persecuted. . . struck down (10) We always carry \n      around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also \n      be revealed in our body. . . (12) So then, death is at work in us, but life \n      is at work in you.</p>\n    <p><b>(Luke 9:23)</b> And He was saying to them all, \"If anyone wishes \n      to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and \n      follow Me. For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it, but whoever \n      loses his life for My sake, he is the one who will save it.\"</p>\n     </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Note: This is a \"daily\" \n        process which leads to increased spiritual life. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    \n    <p><b>(Phil. 3:10,11)</b> .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;that I may know Him, and the \n      power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed \n      to His death; in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.</p>\n     </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Note: The \"and\" after \n        the phrase, \"&#x85;that I may know Him&#x85;\" probably means \n        \"that is\" and serves the purpose of a colon. In other words, \n        Paul is telling us that knowing Christ involves an ongoing process of \n        suffering (\"<i>being conformed</i> to his death\") by which the \n        resurrection power of God is unleashed and we come to know Christ better. \n        </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote>   \n    <p><strong>(Rom. 8:35,36)</strong>&#xA0; \n      Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, \n      or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Just as it \n      is written, \"For thy sake we are being put to death all day long; we \n      were considered as sheep to be slaughtered.\" But in all these things \n      we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Note: Again, Paul speaks of a continued \n        process of suffering (\"all day long\") which somehow releases \n        the power of God to be victorious in the midst of our sufferings. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    \n    <p><b>John 15:2</b> &#xA0;I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;every \n      branch that bears fruit, He prunes it, that it may bear more fruit.</p>\n     </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Note: This passage speaks of an \n        ongoing \"pruning\" in the life of growing Christians so that \n        greater fruitfulness results. Be sure in the lecture to emphasize that \n        this is an ongoing process, which results in character transformation, \n        which bear fruits in the world as the growing believer demonstrates the \n        love of God in the world.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <p><strong>(Watchman Nee)</strong> \"What \n      God is now doing is the pruning work of the vinedresser. In our souls there \n      is an uncontrolled development, an untimely growth, that has to be checked \n      and dealt with. God must cut that off. So now there are two things before \n      us to which our eyes must be opened. On the one hand God is seeking to bring \n      us to the place where we live by the life of his Son (\"abide in me\"). \n      On the other hand he is doing a direct work in our hearts to undo that other \n      natural resource (our sin-nature). Every day we are learning two lessons: \n      a rising up of the life of this One, and a checking and a handing over to \n      death of the other (sinful nature). These two processes go on all the time, \n      for God is seeking the fully developed life of his Son among us . . . What \n      does this mean? It simply means that I will not take any action without \n      relying on God. I will find no sufficiency in myself. I will not take any \n      step just because I have the power to do so. Even though I have that inherited \n      power within me, I will not go ahead solely upon it as (a) basis; I will \n      put no reliance on myself.\" (Watchman Nee, <i>The Normal Christian \n      Life </i>[Fort Washington, Penn.: Christian Literature Crusade, 1961], pp. \n      157,158) </p>\n    \n    <p><b>(John 12:23-26)</b> And Jesus answered them, saying, \"The hour \n      has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. (24) \"Truly, truly, I \n      say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains \n      by itself alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. (25) \"He who \n      loves his life loses it; and he who hates his life in this world shall keep \n      it to life eternal. 26 \"If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and \n      where I am, there shall My servant also be; if anyone serves Me, the Father \n      will honor him.</p>\n     </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Note: Jesus is referring first \n        to himself (vs 23: \" . . . The hour has come for the Son of Man to \n        be glorified . . . \")--his atoning death enables God's spiritual \n        life (<i>zoe</i>) to be given to others. But then he applies this principle \n        to his followers--we must also be willing to follow this path (parallel \n        to Lk. 9:23,24) if we want to bear fruit for God. </p>\n      <p>Remember that suffering in this \n        life has value in our sanctification and is inevitable in proclaiming \n        God's truth to the world (Col. 1:24,25; Rev. 6:11).</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><b>(Col. 1:24)</b> Now I rejoice in what was suffered for \n      you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ's \n      afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3><strong><a name=\"a2\"></a>Three Causes of Suffering </strong></h3>\n\n<blockquote> \n  <p>People often say that suffering is \n    a big problem for Christianity--either God is powerful enough to stop suffering \n    but isn't loving, or he wants to stop suffering but lacks the power to do \n    so. Actually, the Bible presents us with a comprehensive (although not exhaustive) \n    explanation. </p>\n  <p>We can distinguish between three kinds \n    of suffering. God sovereignly works through <i>all</i> of these sufferings \n    to accomplish his purpose in our lives.<a name=\"a3\"></a> We may often experience \n    all three kinds of suffering involved in a single situation, as we will see. \n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<dir> <b>\n  </b><p>1.

Many \n      Christians wrongly believe that being under grace means that God will protect \n      us from this, but there is no scriptural promise to this effect--and many \n      passages which warn us against such presumption (1 Cor. 6:17,18; Rom. 1:24-27 \n      [see also Ps. 81:10-12] </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Examples: Poverty from sloth or \n        unwise spending leading to heavy debt load; damage in marriage from prior \n        sexual promiscuity; more difficulty in career because of laziness in school.</p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p> <b>(Rom. \n          1:24-27) </b>Therefore \n          God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, that their \n          bodies might be dishonored among them&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;(26) \n          For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their \n          women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, (27) \n          and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the \n          woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing \n          indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of \n          their error.</p>\n        <p><b>(Proverbs 6:25-29) </b>Do \n          not desire her beauty in your heart, Nor let her catch you with her \n          eyelids.

They contain entire \n      scrolls or portions of virtually every Old Testament book, except the book \n      of Esther (R. Laird Harris, <i>Inspiration and Canonicity of the Bible</i> \n      Grand Rapids: Zondervan Publishing, 1969, p.&#xA0;139). They also contain \n      writings that reflect this Jewish community's view of the Old Testament. \n      It is clear that the DSS community recognized the same Old Testament canon \n      we recognize. </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>The Manual of Discipline and Zadokite Fragments quote from Isaiah, Deuteronomy, \n        Numbers, Leviticus, and Proverbs with the formula \"It is written.\" \n        Zadokite uses the formula \"God said\" for Isaiah, Malachi, Amos, \n        Zechariah, Hosea, Deuteronomy, Numbers and Micah. The Commentary on Habakkuk \n        indicates that Habakkuk was considered to be inspired.</li>\n      <li>The apocryphal books (more on this later) are quoted also, but never \n        with one of the above formulae (more on the Apocrypha below). </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><i>Conclusion</i>: Long before the Council of Jamnia in 90 AD, the Dead \n      Sea Scrolls quoted from all three divisions as scripture and refer to all \n      three as \"the Law and the Prophets\" or \"Moses and the Prophets.\" \n      The fact that they referred to all of the non-Penteteuchal books as \"the \n      prophets\" is additional evidence that they had ascertained prophetic \n      authorship of these books.</p>\n    <p>Josephus: Josephus, a Jewish historian, wrote twenty years before Jamnia \n      and over 300 years before the Talmud's Tractate <i>Baba Bathra </i>which \n      is used to support the liberal three-stage development theory. Josephus \n      also had the actual Temple scrolls in his possession as a gift from the \n      Roman general Titus. Josephus should therefore be considered more authoritative \n      than the Talmud regarding the first century view of the canon. Josephus' \n      Old Testament was identical to our own. </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>He says there were 22 books in the canon of the Old Testament (5 books \n        of Moses, 13 Prophets, and 4 Writings). This corresponds to our 39 books. \n        He recognized Jeremiah and Lamentations as one book, as he also did Judges \n        and Ruth, 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel, 1 Kings and 2 Kings, 1 Chronicles and \n        2 Chronicles, and Ezra and Nehimiah. The 12 Minor Prophets were also recognized \n        as one book, called \"The Book of the Twelve.\" </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><small>For we have not an innumerable multitude of books among us, disagreeing \n      from and contradicting one another (as the Greeks have), but only twenty-two \n      books, which contain the records of all the past times; which are justly \n      believed to be divine; and of them, five belong to Moses, which contain \n      his laws, and the traditions of the origin of mankind until his death. This \n      interval of time is little short of three thousand years; but as to the \n      time from the death of Moses till the reign of Artexerxes king of Persia, \n      who reigned after Xerxes, the prophets, who were after Moses, wrote down \n      what was done in their times in thirteen books. The remaining four books \n      contain hymns to God, and precepts for the conduct of human life. From Artexerxes \n      to our own time the complete history has been written but has not been deemed \n      worthy of equal credit with the earlier records because of the failure of \n      the exact succession of the prophets.\" (Flavius Josephus, <i>Against \n      Apion</i> 1:8)</small> </p>\n    \n  </blockquote>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Biblical Canonicity","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu3_canon.htm"}

(19) \"Go therefore \n    and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father \n    and the Son and the Holy Spirit, (20) teaching them to observe all that I \n    commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.\" \n  </p>\n  <p><b>Acts 1:8 </b>but you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come \n    upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea \n    and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.\"<br>\n    <b> </b></p>\n  <p><b>2 Cor. 5:18-20 </b>Now all these things are from God, who reconciled us \n    to Himself through Christ, and gave us the ministry of reconciliation, 19 \n    namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting \n    their trespasses against them, and He has committed to us the word of reconciliation. \n    20 Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were entreating \n    through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.<b><br>\n    </b></p>\n  <p>The purpose of the church is not to perpetuate itself. The church is commissioned \n    as God's instrument to reach lost people. It is lost people and not found \n    people, that are the central focus of God's concern (Mark 2:17; Luke 15). \n    Of course, God has great concern for all Christians, but his concern extends \n    to people all across the world who live without him. When a church adopts \n    a mission that excludes evangelism as its central purpose, the clock is ticking \n    toward the breakdown and destruction of that church. <b><br>\n    </b></p>\n  <p><b>Other things that commonly usurp an outreach focus: </b>good fellowship \n    (sweet, but what happens to our fellowship if don't have outreach? , deep \n    knowledge, political agenda, family protection, corporate worship, etc. THINGS \n    THAT ARE NOT WRONG, BUT ARE INADEQUATE AS A FOCUS<br>\n    Therefore, the church must not make these its primary focus (THE GOOD IS OFTEN \n    THE ENEMY OF THE BEST)<b><br>\n    </b></p>\n  <h3><b>What happens if the church loses an evangelism focus? (NOT ALL THESE \n    HAPPEN ALL THE TIME, BUT MANY WILL)</b></h3>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><b>1. Vitality and excitement wane </b>because new converts are the lifeblood \n      of the church.

(FOR PEOPLE TO GROW THEY NEED MINISTRY RESPONSIBILITY)<b><br>\n      </b></p>\n    <p><b>3. We get more self-focused </b>because there are no new converts to \n      care for. <br>\n    </p>\n    <p><b>4. Relational conflict increases </b>because instead of banding together \n      to help witness and care for the new converts, we start looking at how others \n      aren't meeting our needs (Movie: <i>Remember the Titans</i> -- black and \n      white students in a Virginia high school forced to integrate overcome racial \n      differences in their drive to win a state championship). <b><br>\n      </b></p>\n    <p><b>5. The church gets involved in \"brass-polishing\" or \"gingerbread\"-</b>doing \n      less important things that further detract from our real mission. <b><br>\n      </b></p>\n    <p><b>6. An \"ivory tower\" Bible-club mentality </b>develops and \n      people debate nonessential issues and can't relate to non-Christians.<b><br>\n      </b></p>\n    <p><b>7. A \"ghetto\" mentality develops </b>that justifies lack of \n      contact with non-Christians-which will lead to increased vulnerability to \n      tribalism, materialism, and hidden sin.

Our aim is to be biblical people. \n              (1 Thess 2:15) We are not always objective, but our aim is to be \n              objective, fair, and just. Our response to the truth should be personal \n              and thus has subjective elements.

We are not absolutely \n              correct or certain about everything, but our aim is to greater accuracy \n              and certainty. We do not have universal knowledge, nor do we know \n              how to relate truth to every situation, but our aim is more knowledge \n              and discernment for its application. <br>\n              </li>\n            <li>It is antithetical, not synthetic (Matt. 12:30; \n              Ex. 20:1-6). We acknowledge supra-rational aspects of God, but we \n              do not invoke \"mystery\" in order to sanction contradiction, \n              intellectual laziness, or relativism. <br>\n              </li>\n            <li>Truth is a bestowal of God's grace, not my propaganda. \n              Truth is given for our good, not to control and exploit us (ROM \n              1:16). <b><br>\n              </b></li>\n          </ul>\n        </blockquote>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><b>Restart Tape</b></p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p><b> <br>\n        </b>5.

Dennis: The key in communication is to help them see they already DO \n        believe in objective/absolute truth in many areas. Plus, those who denounce \n        Christianity as wrong because we are absolutists just contradicted themselves \n        -- they made an absolute statement by saying we're wrong! <br>\n        9. Craig: Value of human life without objective truth -- total immorality \n        because there is no agreed upon right or wrong way to treat one another. \n        <br>\n        10. Den: Hitler did what he felt was right in his heart -- so \"what \n        I feel is right\" is not a very workable determinant for any belief \n        system. <br>\n        11. Gary: explanation of healthy personal relationships only possible \n        if understand and agree what is right/ wrong/ proper, etc. in a relationship. \n        From a postmodern point of view, there is no such objective thing available \n        and certainly we can't call on the other person to act a certain way. \n        <br>\n        12.

It meant that people should have the legal freedom to practice \n        the religion of their choice, and that you should personally respect and \n        love them, even if you conclude that their beliefs are false. We should \n        expressly affirm this kind of tolerance and deplore this kind of intolerance. \n        <br>\n      </p>\n      <p><b>2.

It means that you must never call others' beliefs false \n        or untrue, or you are an arrogant, intolerant bigot.

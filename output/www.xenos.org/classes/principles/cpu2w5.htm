We \n    have explored the relationship between what we're supposed to do (imperatives) \n    and what God has done (indicatives) and how all that relates to our experience. \n    We also looked at how to appropriate our new identity (know, consider, present) \n    and last week we dealt with our sin nature.</p>\n  <p>There is still something missing. A \n    huge area that we have overlooked - the LAW - God's commands. What about the \n    10 commandments, the rules? This is what most people associate with Christianity. \n    How are Christians supposed to relate to the law? This is a complex area. \n    Why for instance aren't we trimming our clothing with tassels and building \n    fences around our roofs to keep people from falling off? (Deut. 22:8;11,12) \n    Why do we obey some laws in the Bible but not others? Tonight we will look \n    closely at what the Bible says about the law and how we should relate to it.</p>\n  <p>How do Christians relate to the law? \n    (Romans 7:1-6) 7:6* <small>But now we have been released from the Law, \n    having died to that by which we were bound, so that we serve in newness of \n    the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter.</small></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Wrong way: \"oldness of the letter\"</p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>You've died to it (Rom. 7:1-5)</p>\n      <p>It does not work (7:7-25)</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>The right way: \"newness of the \n      Spirit\" (7:8)</p>\n    <p>Two things should be clear from this \n      passage: </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>We no longer have the same relationship \n        with the Law that we had before we came to Christ. Paul says we have \"died \n        to,\" \"been released from\" the Law. This is actually another \n        feature of our new identity. </li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>This is also a key to gaining \n        freedom from sin and living effectively for God. Note the parallelism \n        between this passage (especially 7:4,6; 6:14) and ROM 6:6. In both cases, \n        we have died to them, with the result that a new and better quality of \n        life with God is now available to us. </li>\n    </ul>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p>What is God's purpose for the Law? \n    What does it mean to be \"under the Law?\" In what sense is the Christian \n    \"no longer under law?\" Does the Law play any role in the Christian \n    life whatever? This is an area of great confusion for Christians, because \n    while the flesh is totally corrupt, the law is more complicated<a name=\"a1\">.</a> \n    </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>God's Law itself is good, and we \n      need to understand its proper role in our lives (ROM 7: 7 What \n      shall we say then? Is the Law sin? May it never be!). \n      However, <em>relating to </em>the Law improperly (what Paul calls living \n      \"under the Law\") is always destructive and is in fact a way of \n      living according to our sinful natures. Therefore, the first half of tonight's \n      class will focus on God's intended purpose for the Law, while the second \n      half will focus on living under the Law. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>To properly understand the role of \n    the Law in our sanctification, we need to first understand God's Law and it's \n    purpose. God did not divide the Law into these three components: they were \n    \"braided\" together ( read Lev. 19:23-34 for an example and note \n    that all three components are present). </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Summary: Christians are not under the \n    law in the following ways </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Civil: not obligated to conform \n      our civil laws to the Old Testament's civil law.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Ceremonial: not obligated to relate \n      to God through Old Testament ritual observance.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Moral: not obligated to earn God's \n      acceptance by our good works</li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Moral: not obligated to serve God \n      by our own power.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Let's talk more about God's intended \n    role for the moral law . . . </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Gal. 3:24* <small>Therefore \n    the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be justified \n    by faith.</small></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>The \"tutorial use\" of the \n      Law is a term that stems from Gal. 3:24*, in which Paul states that \"the \n      law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ . . . \" The word \"tutor\" \n      (paidagogos) refers to \"child-conductors,\" or household slaves \n      who were in charge of making their master's children go to school, do their \n      chores, etc. Children under the authority of a task master longed to reach \n      adulthood so they could be free from them. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p>Why do we need a tutor? </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>In the same way, Paul says that the \n      main purpose of the law is to help us to see our need for the freedom of \n      God's grace. It does this by revealing our moral weakness and depravity. \n      </p>\n    <p>By default, we tend to operate in \n      our flesh. We do what comes \"naturally\" to us - under our power, \n      not God's. Approaching God under law is intuitive to our sinful nature, \n      but the Bible says it's counterproductive. Approaching God under grace is \n      counter intuitive, but productive.</p>\n    <p>Paul says the law acts as our tutor \n      in two areas, Justification &amp; Sanctification: </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>What does it look like to live \"under \n    law\" or \"under grace?\" Since Christians can still live \"under \n    law\" even though we are now \"under grace,\" we need to be able \n    to recognize the symptoms of these two ways of living the Christian life. \n    </p>\n  <p>Basically, \"under law,\" I \n    do it. It refers to approaching God's moral commandments <i>directly</i> (by \n    our own resources), while \"under grace\" means \"God does it \n    for me.\" Under grace we approach God's moral commandments <i>indirectly</i> \n    through the provision of Christ. </p>\n  <p>The following chart also explains more \n    practically the difference between serving God \"in the oldness of the \n    letter\" and serving him \"in the newness of the Spirit.\" The \n    chart comes from Dennis McCallum's book, <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/wiv.htm\">Walking \n    in Victory</a><i>.</i> </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>When we live the Christian life \"under \n    law,\" its practical outworking can take many \"faces.\" We are \n    using the term \"legalism\" to describe these different manifestations \n    of living \"under law.\" We should be aware of these forms of legalism \n    both for our own spiritual health, and to help other Christians who are ensnared \n    in them. </p>\n  <p><em>Performance for acceptance by other \n    people </em></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Even if we understand that God accepts \n      us unconditionally and permanently, if we really value certain people's \n      acceptance more than God's, we are living under the law. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Anger when they don't respond \"appropriately.\" \n        </p>\n      <p>Unwillingness to serve unless they \n        are present, or \"accept\" us; more motivated because they are \n        present. </p>\n      <p>Unable to serve anonymously.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Focus on God's acceptance.</p>\n      <p>Drop our expectations of how we \n        want other key people to respond to us. </p>\n      <p>Learn to ask rather than demand. \n        </p>\n      <p>Think through beforehand how we \n        will respond if others don't meet our expectations. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><em>Wrong view of God's moral will</em></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>When we view God's moral will as \n      antithetical to our ultimate fulfillment (GOD AS COSMIC KILLJOY), or as \n      demands for our impersonal obedience out of a sense of duty only, we have \n      believed Satan's lies and become profoundly legalistic. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Complaining about following God.</p>\n      <p>Lack of enthusiasm and excitement.</p>\n      <p>Chronic inability to have victory \n        over a sin-area.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Get into the Word and discover \n        and choose to believe that God loves you!</p>\n      <p>Reflect on the passages that assure \n        us that God's will is for our good (see ROM 12:2b; Jn. 10:10; Deut. 10:13). \n        </p>\n      <p>Reflect on the fact that God's \n        imperatives are invitations to experience more of God's goodness and faithfulness</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><em>Defective ethical priorities</em></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Not all moral issues in the Bible \n      are equally important. Jesus told the Pharisees they \"strained out \n      gnats but swallowed camels\" when they emphasized tithing garden herbs \n      but neglected mercy and justice and faithfulness (Matt. 23:23,24). The Holy \n      Spirit does not treat us as impersonal machines upon which he mindlessly \n      enforces God's morality. Instead, he works with each of us personally and \n      starts with \"first things first.\" Above all, he is out to transform \n      us into people who love others sacrificially. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Equating cigarette smoking with \n        fornication for new Christians.</p>\n      <p>Morality without love (cold, selfish, \n        person who never smokes or cusses).&#xA0; See ROM 13; Mt 22; Jas. 2; 1 \n        Jn. 2:7-11; 1 Cor. 13 for passages that emphasize love as the main ethical \n        priority. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Learn what ethics the Bible emphasizes \n        (e.g., honesty; sobriety; sexual purity; loving others; etc.). </p>\n      <p>Pray for insight to cooperate with \n        the Holy Spirit in his work in people's lives. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><em>Extra-biblical imperatives</em></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>When we make moral rules or absolutes \n      that are not in scripture, we have created a form of legalism.

Ultimately, we have to decide which \n        is more important&#x2014;that we make it as difficult as possible for us to sin, \n        or that we make it as easy as possible for others to come to Christ! </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Use the Word as a \"scalpel\" \n        to pare away the man-made rules. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><em>Perfectionism</em></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>We are not speaking of the doctrine \n      of Christian perfectionism (that Christians can get to the point in this \n      life where they no longer sin), but rather unrealistic moral expectations \n      on one's self or others. In a fallen world, we will never have perfection \n      in any area. As Francis Schaeffer said, \"If we insist on perfection \n      or nothing in any area in this fallen world, we will have nothing every \n      time.\" </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Unwilling to try new things unless \n        success is guaranteed.</p>\n      <p>Everything is \"black and white\" \n        or \"all or nothing\" in relationships, ministry evaluation, etc..</p>\n      <p>Overriding sense of disappointment \n        with whatever we are perfectionistic about; tend to live in the idealized \n        past or future.</p>\n      <p>Unduly rigorous in confronting \n        others.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Ask God to open our eyes to see \n        how much imperfection he tolerates in us! </p>\n      <p>Ask God to see the \"big picture\" \n        and general direction of people's lives rather than just focusing on what \n        is still deficient.</p>\n      <p>Take steps of faith to try new \n        things. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"Resist\" more than \"replace\" \n    emphasis</em></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>When we emphasize what God does not \n      want us to do more than the satisfying life God makes available to us, this \n      casts a negative, ascetic tone (\"I can't\" vs. \"I get to\") \n      to our Christian lives that is uninviting and unmotivating. If we focus \n      only or primarily on what we shouldn't do rather than on what we get to \n      do, this makes sin more attractive. This would also be evident in how we \n      view others' struggle with sin.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Lots of \"Don't do\" language \n        and thinking.</p>\n      <p>Lack of loving output and other \n        ministry.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Emphasize the biblical positives: \n        learning truth, loving others, etc. This is a real key to effective grace-based \n        parenting, discipling, etc..</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><em>Insufficient emphases on indicatives</em></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>We may not have extra-biblical rules, \n      but simply don't teach and model God's grace enough.

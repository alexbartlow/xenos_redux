It is too pervasive and subtle-and \n      unless you replace it with another way of life, you will be drawn back into \n      it. Notice Paul's emphasis in 1 Timothy 6:11 on not only <i>fleeing</i> \n      the love of money, but also <i>pursuing</i> righteousness, godliness, faith, \n      love, perseverance and gentleness. In \n      Luke 12:22-34, Jesus paints a portrait of this way of life. It consists \n      of two non-detachable parts . . . </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p><b>#1 Learn to trust God for \n        your material needs (Luke 12:22-30)</b></p>\n    </blockquote>\n    \n    <blockquote> \n      <p><b>#2 Pursue God's kingdom \n        (Luke 12:31-34)</b></p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><b>1. Learn to trust God for \n      your material needs (Luke 12:22-30)</b> <br>\n      </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p><i>Read 12:22</i>. \"For \n        this reason . . .\" </p>\n      <p>If you pursue materialism, \n        you will have material anxiety. The two go together, and there is no inverse \n        relationship between the amount of money you have and the amount you worry. \n        Those who have very little money can be free of anxiety, while those who \n        have tons of money can be enslaved by material anxiety. <br>\n        This is where the rubber meets the road in trusting God. A lot of us talk \n        about how we trust God, but if we can't trust him here, we do not really \n        trust him.</p>\n      <p><b>Hebrews 13:5</b> Keep your \n        lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because \n        God has said, \"Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.\" \n        6 So we say with confidence, \"The Lord is my helper; I will not be \n        afraid. What can man do to me?\"<br>\n        </p>\n      <p>Why say this here (\"I \n        will not be afraid\")?<br>\n        </p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>Anxiety and fear are driving \n          forces behind avarice</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p><b>Back to Luke 12</b></p>\n      <p><i><b>Jesus gives several reasons \n        why we can trust God in this area: </b></i></p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Read vs 23. <i>Since God's \n          purpose for our lives is more than physical existence, he will provide \n          us with the basics of life needed to fulfill that purpose.</i></li>\n        <li>Read vs 24,27,28. <i>If \n          God provides for lesser members of his creation, he will certainly provide \n          for his own children</i>. The point is not that the birds don't work \n          (they are plenty busy), but that they don't worry (\"I may lose \n          my job, the banks may close, the economy may go south, inflation may \n          eat up my retirement account, etc.\").<br>\n          </li>\n        <li>Read vs 25,26. <i>Anxiety \n          doesn't accomplish anything constructive, so why waste your time worrying?</i> \n          Anxiety can't lengthen our lives by even a little bit-but it can shorten \n          our lives by a lot.<br>\n          </li>\n        <li>Read vs 30. <i>Anxiety is \n          understandable for those who don't belong to God--but not for those \n          who are his children</i>. This leads to the next point . . . </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p><b>What action steps can we \n        take to trust God in this way?</b></p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><i>Don't rationalize material \n          anxiety; judge it as unbelief. Ask God to sensitize you to this, monitor \n          your thought-life, and nip it in the bud instead of allowing it to grow. \n          <br>\n          </i></li>\n        <li><i>Recall God's promises \n          &amp; past record of material faithfulness, &amp; thank him for this. \n          This is a definite choice, often against your current thoughts and feelings.<br>\n          </i></li>\n        <li><i>Resist cultural indoctrination</i> \n        </li>\n        <li><i>Choose to be Content</i> \n          <ul>\n            <li>Focus on God's will \n              for your life.

This doesn't \n        mean spend your whole life trying to get into God's kingdom, because 12:32 \n        says God gladly gives it to those who trust Christ. It means to make God's \n        kingdom the #1 priority in your life, to put the same kind of intensity \n        and creativity and commitment that materialists put into amassing material \n        wealth (12:29 \"seek\") into advancing God's purpose on earth \n        and representing him accurately.

Where \n          we invest our money is both a reliable indicator of your true priorities, \n          and it reinforces your attachment to those priorities in this life. \n          </p>\n        <p>The idea here is not taking \n          a vow of poverty and divesting yourself of all personal property.

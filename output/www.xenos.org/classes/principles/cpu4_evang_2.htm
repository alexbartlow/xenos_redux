Salvation can't be conscience \n      existence and personal annihilation at the same time. The way of salvation \n      can't be a free gift and a wage earned at the same time. The differences \n      are very clear and all religions cannot be held as true. </p>\n    <p><strong>Don't just contrast Christianity \n      to the other religions.</strong> Evaluate the claims of Hinduism from an \n      Islamic perspective, or the claims of Buddhism from a Jewish perspective.</p>\n   \n    <blockquote> \n      <p><b>ANDERSON (Christian): </b>\"The \n        fact is that generalizations about religion are almost always misleading. \n        Nothing could be further from the truth than the dictum&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;&#x91;Religion \n        has not many voices, but only one.&#x92;&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;Even \n        the most cursory examination of the theology of these different religions \n        reveals far more contradiction than consensus.\" (Sir Norman Anderson, \n        <i>Christianity and World Religions: The Challenge of Pluralism </i>[Downers \n        Grove: InterVarsity Press, 1984, p. 15).</p>\n      <p><b>Zaehner (Hindu): </b>\"To \n        maintain that all religions are paths leading to the same goal, as is \n        so frequently done today, is to maintain something that is not true&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;(T)he \n        basic principles of East and West&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;simply are \n        not starting from the same premises. The only common ground is that the \n        function of religion is to provide release; there is no agreement at all \n        as to what (we) must be released from.

Religion as a common genus simply does \n        not exist.\" (Daniel B.

Ministry is <b>what you do</b>-- the act of exercising your gift.. \n        For example, you may develop a hospitality ministry by helping newer people \n        feel welcomed and part of the group and hosting events.<br>\n      </p>\n      <p>2. Ministry can refer to <b>the sphere in which you serve</b>, the group \n        of people among whom you exercise your gifts in service. Examples of ministry \n        spheres might include a junior high cell group, a home church, or a group \n        of terminally ill patients.<br>\n      </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><b>(DIVERSITY OF) Effects </b><br>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Effects are <b>the outcome of our ministries</b>. We bear spiritual fruit \n      in ministry as we impact people for Christ. <br>\n    </p>\n    <p>In the Body of Christ, <b>some</b> will have a more <b>visible, dramatic \n      effect </b>while others' ministry fruit may be less obvious (from our perspective, \n      not God's). THIS HELPS US NOT COMPARE WITH OTHERS<br>\n    </p>\n    <p>IT'S VERY EXCITING THAT GOD HAS SUITED YOU AND I UNIQUELY TO A ROLE IN \n      HIS PURPOSE! <br>\n    </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n  <h4>Discovering and exercising your gift(s):<br>\n  </h4>\n  <p><b>1. Gives you a greater sense of significance and purpose for your Christian \n    life.</b></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>(2 Timothy 4:6-8) 6 For I am already being poured out as \n      a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come. 7 I have fought \n      the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith; 8 in \n      the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the \n      Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to \n      me, but also to all who have loved His appearing. </p>\n    <p>You will share the sense of purpose that Paul had in this passage as God \n      progressively clarifies your unique role. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><b>2. Provides more insight into God's will for your life.</b></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>It is God's will for you to exercise and develop your gift(s). As you do \n      so, there will be many practical implications for decision-making in your \n      life. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><b>3. Provides additional motivation toward spiritual growth.</b> <br>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Why did I turn away from the world? \"Because it's a rush to teach.\" \n      This has been called the \"Expulsive power of a New Affection.\"<br>\n    </p>\n    <p>Also, it is much easier to resist sin when we replace it with the stimulation \n      of ministry. As this happens, you will find greater resistance to the seduction \n      of the world (1 Jn. 2:15,16), which is only a counterfeit to the real purpose \n      for your life.<br>\n    </p>\n    <p>It is difficult to maintain motivation in our sanctification unless we \n      see the purpose for it. <br>\n    </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><b>4. Lets you experience more consistently and to a greater degree the power \n    of the Holy Spirit.<br>\n    </b> </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>This is one of the features of gifting-the Holy Spirit often empowers you \n      with special intensity as you serve in that area. This helps you overcome \n      fearfulness and timidity in your service for Christ. When you serve according \n      to your gifts, you gain confidence in God because you see Him at work in \n      your ministry. This confidence permeates other areas of your Christian life. \n    </p>\n    <p>(2 Tim 1:6-9) And for this reason I remind you to kindle \n      afresh the gift of God which was given to you by the laying on of my hands. \n      For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and \n      discipline. Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, or \n      of me His prisoner; but join with me in suffering for the gospel according \n      to the power of God, who has saved us and called us with a holy calling \n      not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which \n      was granted to us in Christ Jesus from all eternity.<br>\n    </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><b>5. Frees you from making unhealthy comparisons to others and increases \n    healthy interdependence within the Body of Christ.</b><br>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>The devil really likes to alienate us from each other by getting us to \n      compare. The more you discover and develop the unique contribution that \n      you have, the easier it is to be grateful for the contribution of others. \n      This minimizes carnal competition. <br>\n    </p>\n    <p>See 1 Cor 12:14-26 -- For the body is not one member, but \n      many. 15 If the foot should say, \"Because I am not a hand, I am not \n      a part of the body,\" it is not for this reason any the less a part \n      of the body. 16 And if the ear should say, \"Because I am not an eye, \n      I am not a part of the body,\" it is not for this reason any the less \n      a part of the body. 17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing \n      be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be? 18 But \n      now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, just as He \n      desired. 19 And if they were all one member, where would the body be? 20 \n      But now there are many members, but one body. 21 And the eye cannot say \n      to the hand, \"I have no need of you\"; or again the head to the \n      feet, \"I have no need of you.\" 22 On the contrary, it is much \n      truer that the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary; \n      23 and those members of the body, which we deem less honorable, on these \n      we bestow more abundant honor, and our unseemly members come to have more \n      abundant seemliness, 24 whereas our seemly members have no need of it. But \n      God has so composed the body, giving more abundant honor to that member \n      which lacked, 25 that there should be no division in the body, but that \n      the members should have the same care for one another. 26 And if one member \n      suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the \n      members rejoice with it.<br>\n    </p>\n    <p>As you exercise your gift, you appreciate the genius of God's design of \n      the body of Christ: everyone has an important contribution to make. As a \n      result, you are more likely to seek out and receive the contribution that \n      others have been gifted to make. You realize \"I can't do it all. I \n      need others...\"<br>\n    </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <h3><a name=\"discover\"></a>Ways to discover your spiritual gifts </h3>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p> It seems that there is no specific method for discovering spiritual gifts. \n      Instead, God emphasizes certain principles that we employ as we live in \n      the Body of Christ. As we live and function in the Body of Christ our gifts \n      emerge. <br>\n    </p>\n    <p><b>1. Ask God to reveal your gifts</b> </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Remember that God has sovereignly given you the gift(s) that you have. \n        Affirm that he has gifted you for a unique and significant role, and submit \n        in advance to whatever role he has chosen for you. Then ask him to reveal \n        your role to you as you step out in faith to find it. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><b>2. Become a servant</b>. (IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO SERVE, WHY SHOULD \n      GOD SHOW YOU YOUR GIFT?)<br>\n    </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Mark 10:45 For even the Son of Man did not come to be \n        served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.</p>\n      <p>Philippians 2:3-5 Do nothing from selfishness or empty \n        conceit, but with humility of mind let each of you regard one another \n        as more important than himself; 4 do not merely look out for your own \n        personal interests, but also for the interests of others. 5 Have this \n        attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus.</p>\n      <p>Ephesians 4:11,12 It was he who gave some to be apostles, \n        some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and \n        teachers, 12 to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the \n        body of Christ may be built up</p>\n      <p>God laid his life down to meet our needs. He commands us to follow his \n        example, by expending ourselves in the service of others within the framework \n        of the Body of Christ. As we serve, our gifting is manifest. Over time \n        you have probably become aware of different needs/ tasks in home church \n        that are being overlooked (e.g. organizing a retreat, cleaning up after \n        HC, encouraging a new person, etc.). As you make various attempts to serve, \n        some efforts will be fruitful and others won't. Through feedback from \n        others and the result of your efforts, God will open your eyes to unique \n        areas of gifting that you may have. <br>\n      </p>\n      <p>Because servanthood is such and important area, we should carefully distinguish \n        it from its antithesis, selfishness.

How do you respond when God contradicts your \n            agenda with the needs of others?

What kinds of ministry do you experience consistent empowering for?</b></p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>\"I sensed God working through me.\" Gifting is spiritual empowerment, \n        which is partially experiential. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><b>8. What kinds of ministry are you effective in (others' feedback; fruit)?</b><br>\n    </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>What unsolicited feedback do you receive from others? </p>\n      <p>When a pattern emerges of people telling you that God builds them up \n        through you in a certain area, this is a reliable indicator of gifting. \n        On the other hand, we will experience setbacks in areas of gifting so \n        be careful not to give up prematurely.</p>\n      <p>Start looking at others from the perspective of how God has gifted them. \n        Put some thought in on how they might be gifted; let them know when you \n        see them being effective with you or others. This creates an environment \n        much more conducive to the discovery of gifts</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><b>Teachers</b>: do some autobiographical stuff about why you are thriving \n    in the work of God -- both failures and successes. Tell them why you have \n    stuck with it despite the hardships.</p>\n  <p>Everyone wants a fulfilling life. Many Christians have not yet experienced \n    fulfillment in ministry.<br>\n  </p>\n  <p><b>What is fulfillment?</b> Fulfillment is a deep-seated sense of blessing/ \n    joy arising from total commitment to something significant. This is what we \n    were designed for. Total commitment to God's purposes.</p>\n  <p>All of us are committed to something. We have to consider, \"What am \n    I committed to?\" In the US it's the \"me first law.\" We learn \n    to value and seek our personal interests above any other values. We've learned \n    that the biblical world view is dramatically different.<br>\n  </p>\n  <p><b>1 Cor. 9:23-27</b> And I do all things for the sake of \n    the gospel, that I may become a fellow partaker of it. (24) Do you not know \n    that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize? Run \n    in such a way that you may win. (25) And everyone who competes in the games \n    exercises self-control in all things. They then do it to receive a perishable \n    wreath, but we an imperishable. (26) Therefore I run in such a way, as not \n    without aim; I box in such a way, as not beating the air; (27) but I buffet \n    my body and make it my slave, lest possibly, after I have preached to others, \n    I myself should be disqualified.<br>\n  </p>\n  <p>We reach this point gradually as led by God. He gifts us and empowers us \n    to serve effectively. It's not like being committed to ballet, but without \n    talent. God provides the talent and part of our spiritual growth process entails \n    learning that we are inadequate to serve him apart from his empowering.<br>\n  </p>\n  <p><b>2 Cor. 3:5-6a</b> Not that we are adequate in ourselves \n    to consider anything as coming from ourselves, but our adequacy is from God, \n    6 who also made us adequate as servants of a new covenant...<br>\n  </p>\n  <p>The joy offered by Christ, as we align our will with His, far exceeds any \n    worldly attempt for joy.<br>\n  </p>\n  <p><b>John 10:10</b> ...I came that you might have life and have \n    it abundantly.<br>\n  </p>\n  <p><b>Phil 3:7,8</b> But whatever things were gain to me, those \n    things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ. 8 More than that, I \n    count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ \n    Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count \n    them but rubbish in order that I may gain Christ, <br>\n    </p>\n  <p><b>Heb.12:2</b> fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter \n    of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the \n    shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Jesus offers a brilliant example of commitment to God's purposes and his \n      joy flows from living in concert with his Father's will despite the agony \n      he faced.<br>\n    </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <li>We shouldn't be committed to pursuing fulfillment as an end to itself. </li>\n  <li>Joy, in the modern sense, is often absent. Loving others can be painful \n    at times. </li>\n  <li>Our own selfish motives can rob us of the joy/ fulfillment of serving others. \n    <br>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><b>Conclusion</b>: Maybe you have not decided what set of values you are \n    committed <br>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>(Luke 6:46-49) \"And why do you call Me, 'Lord, Lord,' \n      and do not do what I say? 47 \"Everyone who comes to Me, and hears My \n      words, and acts upon them, I will show you whom he is like: 48 he is like \n      a man building a house, who dug deep and laid a foundation upon the rock; \n      and when a flood rose, the torrent burst against that house and could not \n      shake it, because it had been well built. 49 \"But the one who has heard, \n      and has not acted accordingly, is like a man who built a house upon the \n      ground without any foundation; and the torrent burst against it and immediately \n      it collapsed, and the ruin of that house was great.\"</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p><b>Assignments: </b>Study for the exam!<br>\n</p>\n\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Moving Into Ministry","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu4_ministry.htm"}

This is not \n    an NT innovation brought about by the church. While the OT does not provide \n    a detailed development of the Trinity, it does provide hints that God exists \n    as a plurality of Persons.</strong></p>\n \n  <blockquote> \n    <p><b>(Genesis 1:26,27)** </b>Then God said, \"Let us make man in our \n      image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the \n      birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the \n      creatures that move along the ground.\"<br>\n      27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; \n      male and female he created them.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><b>God is referred to in the plural (elohim), yet the verb (\"said\") \n        is singular. God's reference to himself as \"our\" seems in context \n        to imply a plurality within unity&#x97;the creation of humans as one (\"man\") \n        yet plural (\"male and female\") is a picture of what God is like.</b><br>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><strong>(Joshua 5:13-15)</strong>&#xA0; Now when Joshua was near Jericho, \n      he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in \n      his hand. Joshua went up to him and asked, \"Are you for us or for our \n      enemies?\"(14) \"Neither,\" he replied, \"but as commander \n      of the army of the LORD I have now come.\" Then Joshua fell face down \n      to the ground in reverence, and asked him, \"What message does my Lord \n      have for his servant?\"(15) The commander of the Lord's army replied, \n      \"Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy.\" \n      And Joshua did so. </p>\n   \n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>This commander accepts and commands the worship due the LORD \n        which indicates that he is the LORD.</strong> Contrast this to Rev 19:10 \n        where an angel forbids John to worship him. <b>See many other OT passages \n        about \"the angel of the Lord\" in which this angel is distinct \n        from the LORD, yet somehow is the LORD (Ex.&#xA0;3:2-6; Josh. 6:11-23). \n        </b></li>\n    </ul>\n   \n    <p><strong>(Isa. 48:12-16) </strong>Listen to Me, O Jacob, even Israel whom \n      I called; I am He, I am the first, I am also the last. (13) Surely My hand \n      founded the earth, And My right hand spread out the heavens; When I call \n      to them, they stand together. (14) Assemble, all of you, and listen! Who \n      among them has declared these things? The LORD loves him; he shall carry \n      out His good pleasure on Babylon, And His arm shall be against the Chaldeans. \n      (15) I, even I, have spoken; indeed I have called him, I have brought him, \n      and He will make his ways successful. (16) Come near to Me, listen to this: \n      From the first I have not spoken in secret, From the time it took place, \n      I was there. And now the Lord GOD has sent Me, and His Spirit. </p>\n   \n    <blockquote> \n      <p><strong>Note:</strong>&#xA0; In NASB, small caps (whether LORD or GOD) \n        mean YAHWEH(YHWH). YHWH is the only name that refers exclusively to God. \n        \"Adonai,\" \"Elohim,\" etc. are used to refer to God \n        and other persons (context determines). </p>\n    </blockquote>\n   \n    <ul>\n      <li>The speaker is God because he is eternal (\"first and last\" \n        - Isa. 41:4), the Creator (vs 13 - Isa. 42:5). Yet he also says YHWH sent \n        him (vs 16b). Therefore, unless the speaker in vs 16b is a new speaker \n        (as some assert), there are at least two Persons who are called YHWH. \n        This passage does <i>not </i>prove<i> </i>the Spirit is God (vs 16); <strong>it \n        suggests that there are at least two Persons who are both YHWH</strong>. \n      </li>\n    </ul>\n   \n    <p><strong>(Matt. 28:19) </strong>Go therefore and make disciples of all the \n      nations, baptizing them in the <i>name</i> of the Father and the Son and \n      the Holy Spirit . . . </p>\n   \n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>This passage indicates that God is one Being (\"name\" \n        is singular) who exists as three Persons.</strong></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><strong><i>Many other NT passages (e.g. those that assert the deity of \n      Jesus and the HS) provide scriptural material for the Trinity. We will cover \n      those passages in Christology and Pneumatology.</i></strong></p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Why is the Trinity important? </strong></p>\n \n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>God did not need to create other beings in order to love<b>:</b> \n      </strong>there was always love between the Persons of the Godhead (Jn 17:24). \n      How can God be loving/personal without having relationships? This is unresolved \n      in Judaism and Islam. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>It provides a basis for personal love relationships.</strong> \n      Human love relationships are not a biological accident&#x97;they are a reflection \n      of the very nature of God and ultimate reality. God is a community of love \n      relationships, and because we are made in God's image we value them. </li>\n  </ul>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Theology Proper","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu1w2.htm"}

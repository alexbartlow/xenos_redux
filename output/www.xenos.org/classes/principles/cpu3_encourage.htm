We need to be involved enough with other Christians \n    that we are consistently giving and receiving God's love in these different \n    ways (2 Tim. 4:1,2). </p>\n  <p><small>Eph. 4:15 but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all \n    aspects into Him, who is the head, even Christ,</small></p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Body-life is largely the outcome of a group of Christians <i>speaking the \n      truth to one another </i>in love (Eph. 4:15). As a group of Christians communicate \n      God's truth to one another with an attitude of genuine love toward one another, \n      this creates a climate conducive to spiritual growth. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><small>1 Thess. 5:14* And we urge you, brethren, admonish the unruly, encourage \n    the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with all men.</small></p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Speaking the truth in love involves many things, but its primary components \n      are <i>encouragement</i> and <i>admonition</i>. These two \"one another\" \n      imperatives are the verbal ones that are mentioned most frequently in the \n      epistles (see 1 Thes. 5:14*). Each recognizes a key need of Christians, \n      and each seeks to meet that need by communicating a key portion of God's \n      truth, as we will see.&#xA0; If we commit ourselves to become adept at these, \n      we will build the foundation of an effective, Spirit-led ministry.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p>Both encouragement and admonition characterize healthy Christian friendships, \n    marriages, and home groups. </p>\n  <table border=\"1\" width=\"100%\">\n    <tr> \n      <th width=\"33%\">&#xA0;</th>\n      <th width=\"33%\">Our \n        Problem</th>\n      <th width=\"34%\">God's \n        Remedy</th>\n      <th width=\"33%\">Definition</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr> \n      <th width=\"33%\"> \n        <p>ENCOURAGEMENT \n      </p></th>\n      <td width=\"33%\"><small>We \n        are weak and live in a broken and hostile world</small></td>\n      <td width=\"34%\"><small>Strengthen \n        us by communicating God's indicatives/promises from the Bible.</small></td>\n      <td width=\"33%\"><small>Communication \n        of God's truth in love in ways that strengthen Christians to go on following \n        God's will.</small></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr> \n      <th width=\"33%\"> \n        <p>ADMONITION \n      </p></th>\n      <td width=\"33%\"><small>We \n        are sinful and prone to self-deception, and live in a world designed to \n        seduce us from God.</small></td>\n      <td width=\"34%\"><small>Seeks \n        to correct them by communicating God's imperatives/commands.</small></td>\n      <td width=\"33%\"><small>Moral \n        correction through verbal confrontation which is motivated by love. </small></td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n  </blockquote>\n<h3><a name=\"a2\"></a>ENCOURAGING ONE ANOTHER </h3>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><i><b>Parakaleo</b></i><b> comes from the root <i>kaleo</i> (\"to call\") \n    and the preposition <i>para</i> (\"around\").</b> Thus, the word means \n    \"to call alongside,\" or \"to call to or for.\" It was sometimes \n    used in extra-biblical Greek to describe military situations in which soldiers \n    were strengthened to fight on in battle. </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Like all words, <i>parakaleo</i> has a fairly wide semantic range.

How do we typically respond to these trials? \n            We may withdraw, blame others, become fatalistic or cynical, or develop \n            \"Pollyanna\" denial (\"It's really no problem.\"). \n            But what we need is to keep our eyes wide open to reality, and receive \n            encouragement! </p>\n          <blockquote> \n            <p><small>Gal. 6:2 Bear one another's burdens, and thus fulfill the \n              law of Christ.</small></p>\n          </blockquote>\n          <p>Gal. 6:2 says we need to be willing to help those who are weighed \n            down by heavy loads (<i>baros</i> - contrast to <i>phortion</i> in \n            vs 5). Paul says this is a key way of fulfilling Christ's new commandment \n            (Jn. 13:34,35). </p>\n          <p>We need to express empathy and sympathy (Rom.&#xA0;12:15), while \n            we communicate the biblical perspective.</p>\n          <p>Paul expresses empathy about Thessalonian Christians whose loved \n            ones had died, and then reminds them about the Rapture (1 Thes. 4:14,18). \n            We should express empathy when someone experiences a tragic accident \n            or health problem, but then lovingly remind them of Romans 5:3-5; \n            8:28-39; Heb. 13:5; etc. We should empathize with Christians who are \n            realizing how much more sinful they are than they realized, but then \n            also remind them that this is part of the breaking process (Rom.&#xA0;7; \n            2&#xA0;Cor. 4,12). </p>\n          <blockquote> \n            <p><small>1 Thess. 4:14,18 - For if we believe that Jesus died and \n              rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who have fallen \n              asleep in Jesus...Therefore comfort one another with these words.</small></p>\n          </blockquote>\n          <p>We need to realize our tendency.

He has never been \n    in Rome to train them, yet he is confident of this! Notice also two qualities \n    that he says enable them to admonish effectively: </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><small>Rom. 15:14* And concerning you, my brethren, I myself also am convinced \n      that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and \n      able also to admonish one another.</small></p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><b>\"Goodness\"</b> - This obviously doesn't mean moral perfection, \n        but rather good will&#x97;loving concern for one another's well-being \n        (which any of us can have with the help of the Holy Spirit) vs. lack of \n        concern, delight in another's failure, etc. </li>\n      <li><b>\"Knowledge\"</b> - This has nothing to do with having a \n        high IQ or a professional degree, but knowledge of God's Word which provides \n        objective, absolute moral guidance (which is available to all of us) vs. \n        personal opinion, current secular wisdom, etc. </li>\n    </ul>\n    <blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p><small>Col. 3:16 Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you, with \n          all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns \n          and spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God.</small></p>\n        <p><small>Mat. 18:15 \"And if your brother sins, go and reprove him \n          in private; if he listens to you, you have won your brother.</small></p>\n      </blockquote>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Many other passages make this clear (Matt. 18:15ff.; Col. 3:16; 2 Thess. \n      3:15). Note also that Paul called on leaders to be sure to carry out this \n      ministry (2 Tim. 4:2; 1 Thess. 5:12), and frequently cited himself in this \n      area as an example for others (Acts 20:31; Col. 1:28; 1 Cor. 4:14). </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Why Admonition Is Unpopular</h3>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Some formidable forces make it a challenge to build deep convictions about \n    this issue. We should be aware of these forces and know the biblical response&#x97;but \n    never use them as an excuse. In a class this size, some of you probably haven't \n    thought your way through some of these . . . </p>\n \n  <blockquote> \n    <ul>\n      <li><i>Cultural Pressure</i>: Despite the fact that these two forms of biblical \n        love balance and temper one another, they are often pitted against one \n        another today. Encouragement is \"in\" but admonition is \"out.\" \n        No one likes admonition because of our sin nature, but our culture has \n        particular problems with this. Our culture has largely rejected the legitimacy \n        of moral absolutes and therefore equates moral correction with unloving \n        intolerance. According to today's secular climate, humans are capable \n        of healthy moral self-direction and are rendered dysfunctional by external \n        moral intrusion. Admonition is therefore seen as unnecessary and even \n        harmful. </li>\n    </ul>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Unfortunately, many Christians have assimilated this mentality to a remarkable \n        degree. Encouragement is seen as mandatory to spiritual growth, but admonition \n        is tragically absent from many Christians' view of love. It is not \"politically \n        correct\" in the current climate for Christians to confront one another \n        about moral issues. Those who admonish other Christians run the risk of \n        being called intrusive at best, and spiritually abusive at worst. Yet \n        the New Testament is clear that, because of human depravity, it is not \n        possible to love one another without admonishing one another. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <p><i>Past Experience</i>: Some have experienced abusive, excessive or \n          unloving discipline from parents or church leaders. We should understand \n          why people would react against all correction because of this. But this \n          is clearly the BABY-BATHWATER fallacy. In rejecting all correction, \n          we will certainly create a situation just as harmful as the original \n          problem.&#xA0; As mentioned last week, we don't only have problems when \n          we've had abusive authority figures in our past (parents, teachers, \n          etc.) but every bit as damaging are permissive authority figures (parents, \n          teachers, etc.).&#xA0; This is becoming more and more the issue we run \n          into when admonishing in this society. </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p><i>Temperamental Weakness</i>: Some (PHLEGMATICS &#x97; see temperaments \n          in Unit two discussion on Sin Nature) are naturally prone to be diplomatic, \n          compromising peacemakers. Our culture tends to reward this behavior, \n          so it can go virtually unchallenged before you begin to walk with Christ. \n          Your flesh will tend to point out people who are overly confrontative, \n          and tell you that you are more loving than they are. If you don't let \n          God sanctify you in this key area, your relationships will tend to be \n          superficial and your ministry (especially discipleship) will be ineffective. \n          Lean against your ingrained tendency to avoid confrontation: prioritize \n          it, make yourself accountable to others to do it, etc. </p>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Receiving Admonition </h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><i>Value friends who care enough to reprove you!</i></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <p>It is very difficult, if not impossible, to mature without receiving admonition! \n      Solomon makes this point over and over to those who want to be wise and \n      spiritually successful. </p>\n   \n    <p><small>Prov 9:8 - Do not reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you.

Have you forgiven the \n        other person for the hurt he caused you, or do you want to pay him back? \n        Unless we can answer these questions affirmatively, we cannot trust our \n        judgment about whether and how to admonish. </li>\n    </ul>\n    <blockquote> \n      <dl> \n        <dd>Jesus simply said, \"When your brother sins, go and reprove him \n          . . . \" (Matthew 18:15) Scripture provides valuable guidance by \n          placing this statement between two parables.

Unless we understand this, we \n          will tend to evaluate the legitimacy of our admonition on the person's \n          response rather than on the basis that it was carried out in a biblical \n          way. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n  <li><i>It should begin one-on-one and in private.</i> </li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Jesus said, \"When your brother sins, go and reprove him <i>in private</i>.\" \n      (Matthew 18:15) In most cases, admonition should be given in private. Though \n      it may be more convenient or less scary for us to correct someone in the \n      presence of others, it usually not best for the person we are correcting. \n      This is because private admonition makes it easier for the other person \n      to listen to our correction without being defensive. Group or public admonition \n      should be reserved for very serious sins or for when the person has demonstrated \n      an unwillingness to respond to earlier private admonition. \n    </p><dl> \n      <dd>Likewise, a face-to-face setting is preferable to a phone call or letter \n        AND CERTAINLY NOT E-MAIL. Of course, there are exceptions to this, but \n        this is a general rule of thumb. We may feel more comfortable confronting \n        someone with the protection afforded by a phone or letter, but the goal \n        is to help the other person&#x97;not to make it easy for us. Much communication \n        is nonverbal, and only face to face conversation allows full nonverbal \n        communication. There may be issues that should be discussed or clarified \n        on the spot, and this is not possible in a letter. A face-to-face meeting \n        communicates directness and vulnerability on the part of the one who is \n        admonishing.

Most times, our reluctance to get to the point is based on our own fears \n      rather than on redemptive concern for the other person.

We are \n      coming to him as a fellow Christian, equally under God's moral authority, \n      calling him to the same accountability to God to which we ourselves submit. \n      We should make it clear that the primary issue is not between us and the \n      other person, but rather between him and God. We can simply state this, \n      or we can show where the Bible speaks to the issue if necessary. </dd>\n    <dt>&#xA0;</dt>\n    <dd>Because the Bible is God's Word, it has the power to convict people of \n      sin in ways that are impossible for us. If we forget this, we may tend to \n      resort to our own human cleverness or our charm or the forcefulness of our \n      personalities. Instead, we should rely on the power of God's truth and the \n      convicting work of his Spirit. Remember \"the Word of God is living \n      and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing as far as the division \n      between soul and spirit . . . able to judge the thoughts and intentions \n      of the heart.\" (Hebrews 4:12) </dd>\n  </dl>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n  <li><i>Be patient rather than insisting on immediate response. </i></li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote> \n  <dl> \n    <dd>In order to give God the opportunity to convict the other person, we should \n      normally urge him to prayerfully reflect on what we have said if he doesn't \n      respond properly to your admonition. Unless the matter is so serious that \n      immediate compliance is necessary (physical violence, for example), it is \n      usually best to respond to his resistance by saying something like, \"I'd \n      like you to think and pray about what I've shared with you on this issue. \n      Let's talk more about this in a couple of days.\" </dd>\n    <dd>&#xA0;</dd>\n    <dd>This gives the person some time to calm down, and it affords God some \n      time to penetrate their initial resistance with his conviction.

No doubt this is why Jesus prescribed \n      multiple discussions in Matthew 18:15-17. </dd>\n  </dl>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n  <li><i>It should be practical and constructive when possible.</i></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n  <dl> \n    <dd>Galatians 6:2 says we should \"restore with gentleness\" those \n      who have been caught in any trespass. This verse certainly underscores the \n      importance of having a redemptive attitude toward the people we admonish, \n      but it also urges us to go even farther. Are there practical ways we can \n      help the person overcome this sin? Is there additional help we might be \n      able to give? It is certainly valid to say \"God says you should not \n      be having sex with your girlfriend.\" But after the person has agreed \n      that this is wrong, it may be more helpful to follow this admonition with \n      a suggestion like \"Why don't you and your girlfriend evaluate what \n      situations make it easy for you to fall sexually, and agree together to \n      avoid those situations?\" Being constructive may require more mental \n      effort on our part before we admonish someone, but it is part of being a \n      restorative influence. </dd>\n    <dd>&#xA0;</dd>\n    <dd>QUALIFICATION: There are times when we must address issues without having \n      any constructive practical help to offer. If we have made the effort and \n      come up empty, we often still need to be willing to speak the corrective \n      word. In these situations, it is sufficient to say that we would like to \n      be able to help more, and that we will be praying for God to give the person \n      the insight he may need to overcome this issue. We may also urge him to \n      talk to someone we know who may be able to give him this kind of help.

What can <i>you</i> \n    do to improve them (<i>not</i>: \"What should they do to improve them?\")? \n  </p>\n \n  <blockquote> \n    <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/speaktruth_chart.gif\" width=\"461\"></p>\n    <p>\"DISENGAGED\" - This is what I call \"playing church.\" \n      This is the antithesis of Christian Body-life and often characterizes the \n      modern church. Our criticism of the traditional church (RITUAL OF FELLOWSHIP; \n      TURN &amp; GREET; FELLOWSHIP HALL) is about this. People are physically \n      present during meetings, but that's about it. People rarely get together \n      outside of meetings. Or if they do get together, it is usually limited to \n      diffuse settings or superficial and safe conversations. People are courteous, \n      even friendly&#x97;but distant. There is an atmosphere of superficiality, \n      sometimes an unspoken conspiracy to not be deeply involved in one another's \n      lives. </p>\n    <p>\"FINGER-POINTING\" - This is what characterized many of our home \n      churches during the early 1980's. People were being admonished too frequently \n      (sometimes for things that should have been tolerated, sometimes for things \n      that weren't even sin). People were being held accountable for things they \n      hadn't agreed to do. This kind of group or relationship is usually goal- \n      and task-oriented, and highly activistic. But because there is little encouragement, \n      a legalistic climate develops. The goals of the group or focus on sin tends \n      to dominate so there is limited time and energy to help people in need. \n      Anger and self-righteousness rather than genuine love become the motivation \n      for admonition. In this climate, it's easy to be afraid to open up about \n      your weaknesses and failures, because you're afraid you will be judged. \n      It's easy to simply perform in the externals to earn approval and acceptance. \n      People burn out, or run away because they can't take the pressure . . . \n    </p>\n    <p>\"SUPPORT GROUP\" - This could also be called the \"schmoozing\" \n      atmosphere. Our culture, working from a humanistic and deterministic base, \n      approves of encouragement and regards it as essential for our fragile psyches. \n      The theory seems to be \"If we just affirm and encourage people, they \n      will naturally grow.\" But it hates admonition and regards it as destructive \n      and an unloving violation of personal privacy. Of course, this is inadequate \n      because people are also sinful and prone to self-deception. When we are \n      not being called on to take responsibility to deal with our sins and move \n      forward, our moral problems and low commitment go unaddressed and therefore \n      tend to get worse. The group or relationship takes on a warm, but soft tone. \n      It becomes more resistant to confrontation, challenge, calls to action&#x97;seeing \n      them more and more as \"unloving,\" \"intrusive,\" \"legalistic.\" \n      People who see the need for admonition get frustrated because they aren't \n      supported in this difficult work. They may even be viewed as the unloving \n      one, the problem in the group. </p>\n    <p>HEALTHY BODY-LIFE - In a home group or relationship which has healthy Body-life, \n      people are communicating both encouragement and admonition in appropriate \n      and timely ways. The leaders have modeled this, and others have begun to \n      imitate them. The atmosphere is warm, but also forward moving. People feel \n      affirmed, but also challenged. The chart is somewhat deceptive here, because \n      in a healthy group encouragement will be more frequent than admonition. \n      This is the ideal toward which we should strive. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n \n  <p>NOTE:&#xA0; We have a policy in this church that in serious situations you \n    can \"go over the head\" of your leaders.&#xA0; Every home group has \n    a staff consultant that can be approached for advice if there is not resolution \n    on the home group level.&#xA0; We also have a Grievance Board if needed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Memory Verses </h3>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Rom. 15:14* - All Christians have the responsibility to admonish one another. \n    Goodness (love) and (biblical) knowledge are the two keys to effective admonition. \n  </p>\n  <p>1 Thes. 5:14* - All Christians should practice encouragement and admonition \n    as appropriate. </p>\n  <p>Heb. 10:24,25* - Effective encouragement requires prayerful forethought. \n    We should come together with other Christians willing and ready to encourage \n    them. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Assignment </h3>\n<p>Read Fee &amp; Stewart, <i>How to Read the Bible Book by Book</i>, p. 14-24, \n  267-268.

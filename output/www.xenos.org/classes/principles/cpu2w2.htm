It assumes that something is already inside; \n        the idea is to bring it out into view. \"Fear and trembling\" \n        connotes recognition of powerlessness (see 1 Cor. 2:3) and sincerity and \n        respect (Eph. 6:5). </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><strong>(Matt. 28:18-20)</strong> \n      &#xA0;&#xA0; \"(All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on \n      earth). <u>Go</u> &lt;therefore&gt; and <u>make disciples of all the nations, \n      baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, \n      teaching them to observe all that I commanded you</u>; and (lo, I am with \n      you always, even to the end of the age). </p>\n    <p><strong>(2 Peter 1:2-7)</strong>&#xA0; \n      Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of \n      Jesus our Lord.3 (His divine power has given us everything we need for life \n      and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory \n      and goodness.4 Through these he has given us his very great and precious \n      promises), so that through them you may participate in the divine nature \n      and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.5 &lt;For \n      this very reason&gt;, <u>make every effort to add to your faith goodness; \n      and to goodness, knowledge;6 and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, \n      perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness;7 and to godliness, brotherly \n      kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love.</u></p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>[Teacher's Note: Verse 4 is in \n        the subjunctive mood, it's not an indicative.&#xA0; It is the mood of \n        possibility -- if they live out the indicatives by doing the imperatives \n        -- not certainty.]</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><strong>(Heb. 10:19-25)</strong>&#xA0; \n      Therefore, brethren, &lt;since&gt; (we have confidence to enter the holy \n      place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which He inaugurated \n      for us through the veil, that is, His flesh), and &lt;since&gt; (we have \n      a great priest over the house of God), <u>let us draw near with a sincere \n      heart in full assurance of faith</u>, (having our hearts sprinkled clean \n      from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water). <u>Let us \n      hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering</u>, &lt;for&gt; (He \n      who promised is faithful); and <u>let us consider how to stimulate one another \n      to love and good deeds, not forsaking our own assembling together, as is \n      the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you \n      see the day drawing near</u>. </p>\n    <p><strong>(Col. 3:1-15)</strong> &#xA0; \n      &lt;Therefore if&gt; (you have been raised up with Christ), <u>keep seeking \n      the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God</u>. \n      <u>Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth</u>. \n      &lt;For&gt; (you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When \n      Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with \n      Him in glory). &lt;Therefore&gt; <u>consider the members of your earthly \n      body as dead to immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed, which \n      amounts to idolatry</u>. &lt;For&gt; (it is because of these things that \n      the wrath of God will come upon the sons of disobedience, and in them you \n      also once walked, when you were living in them). &lt;But now you also&gt;, \n      <u>put them all aside: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and abusive speech \n      from your mouth. Do not lie to one another</u>, &lt;since&gt; (you laid \n      aside the old self with its evil practices, and have put on the new self \n      who is being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the One \n      who created him--a renewal in which there is no distinction between Greek \n      and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and freeman, \n      but Christ is all, and in all) . . . &lt;So&gt;, (as those who have been \n      chosen of God, holy and beloved), <u>put on a heart of compassion, kindness, \n      humility, gentleness and patience; bearing with one another, and forgiving \n      each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone</u>; &lt;just as&gt; \n      (the Lord forgave you), so also <u>should you</u>. 16 <u>Let the word of \n      Christ richly dwell within you, with all wisdom teaching and admonishing \n      one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness \n      in your hearts to God. 17 And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in \n      the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father</u>. \n      </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>This means that sanctification is \n      not something we do by ourselves. God is with us, and he is going to give \n      us all the resources and motivation we need to live for him and do his will. \n      If we understand this, it will build our confidence and motivation to live \n      for God (2 Pet. 1:3,4). It also provides us with the proper reasons/motive \n      for following God. In other words, the more we focus and reflect on the \n      indicatives, the more hope we have that God can change us, the more motivated \n      we will be to follow him, etc. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>This also helps us to view God's \n      imperatives properly--not as impersonal orders to be obeyed out of fear \n      and/or duty, but as invitations to experience more of God's love, goodness, \n      faithfulness, redemptive power, etc.&#xA0; </p>\n    <p>What do we call a Christian walk \n      that is ignorant of or neglects this relationship? This is a primary form \n      of legalism--just focusing on what God commands us to do without any dependence \n      on him. </p>\n    <p>Note the relationship in John 8:11 \n      in Jesus' encounter with the adulterous woman.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>This is obedience to God. It should \n      <em>follow</em> or <em>be part of</em> \"thinking\" \"thanking\" \n      and \"asking\". &#xA0; This is the way we express our trust and \n      experience his goodness and faithfulness. We develop this in the next section.</p>\n    <p><strong>Note: </strong>Since we tend \n      to be self-sufficient (the opposite of dependent), God allows various sufferings \n      into our lives to teach us our need for dependence (more on this later in \n      this unit). This is why \"failure is often the back-door to success.\" \n      </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Christian Principles Unit #2:A biblical view of spiritual growth","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu2w2.htm"}

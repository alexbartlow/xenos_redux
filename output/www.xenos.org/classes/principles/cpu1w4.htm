Moriah. Mt. Moriah is the \n          site of Jerusalem, the Temple (2&#xA0;Chron.&#xA0;3:1), and Jesus' death. \n          </li>\n        <li>God, like Abraham, offered up \n          \"his son, his only son, whom he loved\" (Jn.&#xA0;3:16 probably \n          purposefully echoes this wording). </li>\n        <li>Jesus, like Isaac, carried the \n          instrument of his own death to the site (Jn.&#xA0;19:17). </li>\n        <li>Isaac was old enough to carry \n          wood for the sacrifice up the mountain. We can infer from this that \n          he was probably in his teen years or older. It's unlikely that Abraham \n          in his old age could have forced Isaac down on the altar. Isaac likely \n          offered himself <i>voluntarily</i> in faith, just like Jesus did.  \n        </li>\n        <li>Isaac's deliverance from \n          death was a prophetic type of Jesus' resurrection (see Heb.&#xA0;11:19). \n          </li>\n        <li>Isaac was the progenitor of \n          the promised \"seed\" (Gen. 12:3). Through this event, God explains \n          further <i>how</i> the \"Seed\" would make God's blessing available \n          to all the nations&#x97;by dying a substitutionary death.  \n          <p><strong>Note:</strong> Although \n            Abraham evidently did not yet know this, God later made it very clear \n            that he detested child sacrifice as a form of religious worship (Lev.&#xA0;18:21; \n            Jer.&#xA0;32:35). Furthermore, it is not intrinsically morally objectionable \n            for God to require the life of human beings. He does this ultimately \n            at judgment, and he required the life of his own Son.</p>\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>Was Jesus referring to this incident \n        in Jn. 8:56,57? \"My day\" may well refer to Jesus' crucifixion \n        (\"my hour;\" \"my time\"). Jesus may be saying that Abraham \n        saw in this event a picture of Jesus' most important act. </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Jesus may have actually been \n          \"the angel of the Lord\" who directed him not to kill Isaac \n          but offer up the ram instead. Vs 12 indicates that the angel of the \n          Lord, while he speaks of God in the third person, is also the One to \n          whom the sacrifice is offered. (See also Judges&#xA0;13:18,22). </li>\n      </ul>\n    </blockquote>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Summary: The original \n        audience could see that God provided a substitute and possibly that this \n        place would be the place of future atonement.&#xA0; </strong></li>\n    </ul>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p><strong>In view of subsequent revelation, \n        the location (Moriah) and the identity (only Son) of God's atonement, \n        and his resurrection are clear.</strong></p>\n    </blockquote>\n   \n    <p><b>Ex. 12:1-14</b> \n      - The good news is that God is going to judge Egypt so that Pharaoh lets \n      God's people go. The bad news is that the Israelites will be judged also&#x97;unless \n      they observe this ritual. If they do observe it, his judgment will \"pass \n      over\" those houses. Note these key elements in the ritual meal: </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>The sacrifice must be <i>without \n        physical defect</i> (vs 5). </li>\n      <li>It must be <i>killed</i> (vs 6). \n        </li>\n      <li>Its <i>blood</i> (proof of its \n        death) is what causes God's judgment to \"pass over\" (vs 7,22,23). \n        </li>\n      <li>Displaying the blood, eating in \n        haste (unleavened bread), and being dressed in readiness demonstrated \n        their faith that God would deliver them through his appointed means. God's \n        provision must be appropriated through faith. </li>\n      <li>God commanded that they celebrate \n        Passover yearly as a memorial (Ex. 12:14,26,27).</li>\n      <li>God commanded that they celebrate \n        Passover <i>in the land</i> (vs 25). Deut.&#xA0;16:5,6; 2 Chron. 6:6). \n        This has prophetic significance, as we shall see (Deut. 16:5,6; 2 Chron. \n        6:6 - eventually God specified that Passover be celebrated in Jerusalem).</li>\n      <li><strong>Summary: Substitute must \n        be without defect and be personally appropriated through faith to be effective; \n        location of sacrifice (Jerusalem).</strong></li>\n    </ul>\n   \n    <p><b>Lev. 4</b> \n      - The tabernacle was a mobile tent that God ordered the nation of Israel \n      to put up every time they pitched camp. It illustrated his desire to dwell \n      among his people, the problem that prevented him from fully doing this&#x97;and \n      the solution he would one day provide for this problem. The problem is human \n      sinfulness, illustrated by the physical barriers (veils before the holy \n      place and the holy of holies) and the necessity of priests. The solution \n      is substitutionary atonement offered through God's chosen mediator-priest. \n      Note the common elements: </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>They must slay an animal of God's \n        choosing that is without defect &gt;&gt; <i>blameless substitute </i>(vs \n        3,23,28,32). </li>\n      <li>The offerer must lay his hands \n        on the animal's head, symbolically <i>identifying</i> the sacrifice with \n        his sins (vs 4,15,24,29,33). </li>\n      <li>The priest must offer the animal \n        for them &gt;&gt; <i>mediator</i> (vs 5,16,25,30,34). Because this was \n        only a picture, the (sinful) priests had to offer a sacrifice for their \n        own sins before they could act as a mediator for others. </li>\n      <li>They had to go through these grisly \n        ritual sacrifices virtually every day. This not only kept them focused \n        on the problem of sin and God's remedy (substitutionary atonement); it \n        also indicated that these sacrifices were ultimately insufficient (Heb. \n        10:1-4), in that the people had no direct access to God, and they had \n        no assurance of complete forgiveness. </li>\n    </ul>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>\"Unintentional \n        sins\"</strong> (vs 2,22,27; Num.&#xA0;15:27-29) evidently refer to \n        sins that do not involve an intentional rejection of God and/or his provision \n        for forgiveness.</p>\n      <p> <strong>\"Presumptuous sins\"</strong> \n        (Num.&#xA0;15:30,31; Deut. 17:12,13) evidently refer to defiant sins that \n        reject God and his means of provision. This is what the author of Hebrews \n        is referring to in Heb.&#xA0;10:26-31. </p>\n      <p>God forgives sin, but won't forgive \n        a sinner who won't repent.&#xA0; The unrepentant is the <em>presumptuous \n        </em>sinner.</p>\n      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Leaders \n        were required to offer male goats (Lev.&#xA0;4:22,23), while common people \n        were required to offer female goats (Lev.&#xA0;4:27,28). Since male goats \n        were more valuable because of their greater capacity to produce offspring, \n        those in positions of greater responsibility evidently had to make more \n        costly sacrifices. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n   \n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Summary: Sin is the main \n        issue (sacrifices needed daily - see Heb. 7:27;10:11)!

We may \n        come into God's presence <i>only</i> in the way which he prescribes&#x97;or \n        else his holiness will consume us. (This is an example of \"presumptuous \n        sin.\") </p>\n      <p>The <i>high priest</i> is the only \n        one who can enter the Holy of Holies (vs 4). He must dress and bathe in \n        a way which symbolizes purity (vs 4). He symbolizes God's chosen mediator. \n        The high priest must offer a sacrifice for his own sins (vs 11)&#x97;one of \n        the inferiorities of this symbolic system (Heb. 7:26-28). </p>\n      <p>The <i>two goats</i> (vs 5) are \n        both sin-offerings representing the nation of Israel. The fact that they \n        are chosen by lots for their roles (vs 8) teaches that the sacrifice is \n        chosen by God rather than by humans. The fact that they are offered to \n        the Lord at the doorway of the tent of meeting may emphasize that God \n        is communicating substitutionary atonement to all the people. It may also \n        symbolize Christ's public death. </p>\n      <p>The \"ark of the covenant\" \n        means the \"box of the evidence\"&#x97;God's legal indictment \n        of their sins (MANNA: rejection of God's provision [Ex.&#xA0;16:32-34]; \n        ROD: rejection of God's leadership [Num.&#xA0;17:10]; TABLETS: rebellion \n        and stubbornness [Deut.&#xA0;31:26,27]). The cherubim are angels (often \n        associated with God's righteousness), so their downward look illustrates \n        God's focus on their sins. <br>\n        The high priest slays one of the goats and offers its blood on the mercy \n        seat (\"mercy\" means \"to cover\" or \"to atone\") \n        to atone for the nation's sins that year (vs 16,17). (OVERHEAD ON ELEMENTS \n        ON/INSIDE ARK OF THE COVENANT &gt;&gt; Ex. 25:10-22) This symbolizes the \n        death of a blameless substitute for the guilt of our sins. <br>\n        </p>\n      <p>The high priest then lays his hands \n        on the other goat and confesses Israel's sins as he does so&#x97;symbolizing \n        identification. Then he chases the animal off to the wilderness. This \n        symbolizes that fact that the guilt of their sins has been sent off because \n        of the atoning death of the substitute (vs 20-22). \"Forgiveness\" \n        (Greek: <i>aphiemi</i>) means \"a sending off/away\" of our true \n        moral guilt.</p>\n      <p>Again, the fact that this sacrifice \n        had to be reenacted year after year indicated the insufficiency of the \n        system (Heb. 10:1-4).</p>\n      <p>Note to teachers: We are assuming \n        that when the ark was in the tabernacle, it contained manna, Aaron's rod, \n        and the Law (see Ex. 16:33-34; Num. 17:1-11; Ex. 25:16;31:16; Heb. 9:4). \n        But when the ark was moved to Solomon's temple, the ark apparently only \n        contained the tablets of the law (1 Kings 8:9).</p>\n    </blockquote>\n   <b> \n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Summary: </strong>Greater \n        development of separation caused by sin and removal of guilt through the \n        substitute's death.&#xA0; In addition, we find that the intercessor must \n        be clean and his return from the offering signified God's acceptance of \n        the sacrifice.</li>\n    </ul>\n    </b>  \n    <p><b>Isa. 52:13-53:12**</b> \n      - This passage clearly teaches that God never viewed the animal sacrifices \n      as efficacious in themselves. They were always a prophetic picture of God's \n      chosen Servant&#x97;a blameless Jewish Person whose voluntary death would \n      pay for humanity's sins. Isaiah 52:13-53:12 is the culmination of four passages \n      that progressively reveal more information about the suffering servant (42:1- \n      9, 49:1-13, 50:4-11).

Furthermore, the \n        context indicates that this Servant's death is a future event (52:13-15; \n        53:11 \"will\"). </p>\n     \n      <p><strong>Note: </strong>What about \n        the view that the Servant is the nation of Israel? 53:8 says the Servant \n        is killed \"for the transgression of my people.\" He is also righteous, \n        unlike Israel.

The Synoptic authors seem to only mention the ways that Jesus \n        diverged from the normal Passover liturgy. The head of the household normally \n        passed the bread out in silence&#x97;but Jesus explained that it represented \n        his body/physical death for them. They normally drank four cups&#x97;two \n        before the meal and two afterwards. The third cup was called the \"cup \n        of redemption,\" and Jesus explained its significance in vs.&#xA0;28. \n        The fourth cup was called the \"cup of consummation\" looking \n        forward to God's future kingdom. In vs 29, Jesus refuses to drink this \n        cup until he comes back. The Jews customarily ended this meal by singing \n        Ps.&#xA0;116-118. Note especially Ps.&#xA0;118:6-9,17,18,22,23, which \n        speak prophetically of Jesus' death and resurrection. See William L.

These minerals could sustain life, but the Dead Sea cannot \n        support life because the nutrients are so concentrated. In the same way, \n        Christians will not benefit from the spiritual nutrients that God supplies \n        if they are unwilling to love others and practice what they learn. A vital \n        relationship with Christ requires both receiving his love and giving it \n        away to others. </p>\n      <blockquote> \n        \n        <p>Jn.&#xA0;4:34 - Jesus said to them, \"My food is to do the will \n          of Him who sent Me, and to accomplish His work.</p>\n        <blockquote> \n          <p>He modeled it by witnessing to the woman at the well. He was fed \n            by serving her in this way. He told them that such ministry was a \n            \"food\" they did not know about. \n          </p>\n        </blockquote>\n        <p>Jn.&#xA0;6:1-13 - Jesus therefore lifting up His eyes, and seeing that \n          a great multitude was coming to Him, said to Philip, \"Where are \n          we to buy bread, that these may eat?\" (6) And this He was saying \n          to test him; for He Himself knew what He was intending to do. (7) Philip \n          answered Him, \"Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient \n          for them, for everyone to receive a little.\" (8) One of His disciples, \n          Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to Him, (9) \"There is a lad \n          here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these for \n          so many people?\" (10) Jesus said, \"Have the people sit down.\" \n          Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number \n          about five thousand. (11) Jesus therefore took the loaves; and having \n          given thanks, He distributed to those who were seated; likewise also \n          of the fish as much as they wanted. (12) And when they were filled, \n          He said to His disciples, \"Gather up the leftover fragments that \n          nothing may be lost.\" (13) And so they gathered them up, and filled \n          twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves, which were \n          left over by those who had eaten.</p>\n        <blockquote> \n          <p>Next, he put them in a situation in which they could discover it \n            for themselves. Notice that as they gave to others (in the midst of \n            their own need), they found their needs met as a result (Twelve baskets \n            full corresponding to the twelve disciples). </p>\n          \n        </blockquote>\n        <p>Jn.&#xA0;13:1-17 - Now before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus knowing \n          that His hour had come that He should depart out of this world to the \n          Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to \n          the end&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;(3) Jesus, knowing that the Father \n          had given all things into His hands, and that He had come forth from \n          God, and was going back to God, (4) rose from supper, and laid aside \n          His garments; and taking a towel, He girded Himself about. (5) Then \n          He poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, \n          and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;(12) \n          And so when He had washed their feet, and taken His garments, and reclined \n          at the table again, He said to them, \"Do you know what I have done \n          to you? (13) \"You call Me Teacher and Lord; and you are right, \n          for so I am. (14) \"If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, washed \n          your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. (15) \"For \n          I gave you an example that you also should do as I did to you. (16) \n          \"Truly, truly, I say to you, a slave is not greater than his master; \n          neither is one who is sent greater than the one who sent him. (17) \"If \n          you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.\"</p>\n        <blockquote> \n          <p>Based on believing in the sufficiency of his Father's love for him \n            (vs&#xA0;1-4), Jesus modeled it again for them (while they were arguing \n            about who was greatest), then he told them they should do it with \n            each other, then he delivered the point in vs 17 (<i>makarios</i> \n            means \"fulfilled\"). </p>\n          \n        </blockquote>\n        <p>Acts&#xA0;20:35* - \"&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;remember the words \n          of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, 'It is more blessed to give \n          than to receive.'\"</p>\n        <blockquote> \n          <p>Whereas the world teaches that we will be happy when we get other \n            people to love us the way we want them to, Jesus teaches that we will \n            be fulfilled when we learn to love others the way he loves us.&#xA0; \n            If we believe that we will be happy only when others love us, we will \n            live in utter bondage. Then we will allow our fulfillment/happiness \n            to be controlled by others.&#xA0; We must realize that people will \n            never be equipped to meet our needs. Only Christ can provide true \n            fulfillment.</p>\n        </blockquote>\n      </blockquote>\n    </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Body-Life as a Means of Growth","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu3_bodylife.htm"}

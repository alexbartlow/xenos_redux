Do the following statements sound familiar \n    to you?: </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>\"We should rely on the clergy/experts<i> to tell us what the Bible \n      means.\" </i> </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>This statement reflects the assumption that the meaning of scripture \n        is beyond the reach of the average person. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\"People have always disagreed about the meaning of the Bible (different \n      denominations).\" </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>People have disagreed, and sometimes their disagreements have been brutal. \n        So is the best posture tolerance of hermeneutical diversity? To what extent? \n        Are all meanings valid?</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\"The Bible has been used to justify everything you can think of. You \n      can make it mean anything you want it to mean.\" </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>We can show clear historical instances in which people have interpreted \n        the Bible through their own cultural values, often without even being \n        aware of it. EXAMPLES: <i>slavery</i> (using Old Testament permission \n        vs. Philemon &amp; New Testament silence); <i>women</i> (patriarchal views \n        vs. Bible); <i>capitalism as a biblically sanctioned economic system; \n        Christian psychology self-help books proof-texting secular theories </i>(e.g., \n        Self-Esteem). </p>\n      <p>Can we become aware of our own cultural values sufficiently to avoid \n        this, or should such historical abuse lead us to cynicism about the possibility \n        of \"objective interpretation?\" </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\"That's just your interpretation.\" \"It's impossible to determine \n      the original author's meaning, rather, as we read it, we create our own \n      meaning for the text.\" </p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>These statements reflect the relativism and postmodernism that has permeated \n        our whole culture. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>The challenge:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu3_h1.jpg\" alt=\"wpe1.jpg (5028 bytes)\" width=\"323\"></p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p>You may realize these are all secular, non-Christian objections. But what \n    about the following scenarios? </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>In a home Bible study when someone says <i>\"What this passage means \n      to me is . . .\" </i>And then someone else says, <i>\"That's great. \n      But I got a different meaning (and his meaning is contradictory).\" \n      </i>And everyone concludes by saying <i>\"Praise God for all the great \n      insight we're getting!\" </i>Aren't we violating the law of non-contradiction \n      by accepting this resolution?' </p>\n    <p>What about this story: <i>\"Almost twenty years ago I rode in a car \n      with a fellow believer who relayed to me what the Lord had 'told' him that \n      morning in his quiet time. He had been reading the KJV of Matthew; and I \n      perceived that not only had he misunderstood the archaic English, but also \n      that the KJV at that place had unwittingly misrepresented the Greek text. \n      I gently suggested there might be another way to understand the passage \n      and summarized what I thought the passage was saying. The brother dismissed \n      my view as impossible on the grounds that the Holy Spirit, who does not \n      lie, had told him the truth on this matter. Being young and bold, I pressed \n      on with my explanation of grammar, context, and translation, but was brushed \n      off by a reference to 1 Cor. 2:10b-15: spiritual things must be spiritually \n      discerned-which left little doubt about my status. Genuinely intrigued, \n      I asked this brother what he would say if I put forward my interpretation, \n      not on the basis of grammar and text, but on the basis that the Lord himself \n      had given me the interpretation I was advancing. He was silent a long time, \n      and then concluded, 'I guess that would mean the Spirit says the Bible means \n      different things to different people.'\"</i> D. A. Carson, <i>Exegetical \n      Fallacies</i> (Grand Rapids: Baker Book House Co., 1984) p. 13. <br>\n      If we accept this, aren't we accepting relativism in the name of spiritual \n      experience?</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><b>Definition of Hermeneutics: The science/art of interpreting texts.</b></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p> 2 Tim 2:15* Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman \n      who does not need to be ashamed, handling accurately the word of truth.</p>\n    <p>\"handling accurately\" implies there is a proper interpretation<br>\n      \"be diligent\" implies there are obstacles and difficulties involved<br>\n      \"ashamed\" implies good interpretation is achievable</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p>These issues highlight the importance of two closely related areas of bibliology: \n    hermeneutics and perspicuity. </p>\n  \n</blockquote>\n<h2><a name=\"a2\"></a>Hermeneutical Systems</h2>\n<p> <i>In November of 1999 we deleted this section from the Christian Principles \n  Class. We decided to include more detailed instruction and practice on Inductive \n  study. </i> \n</p><blockquote> \n  <h3> Allegorical </h3>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><i>Definition</i></p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>The literal meaning of the text is either not the true meaning or only \n        one of many meanings. The elements of each passage have a corresponding \n        spiritual reality which is the \"real\" or ultimate meaning of \n        the passage. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><i>History</i></p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>This method was used by many 2<sup>nd</sup> - 4<sup>th</sup> century \n        fathers. It was established as the preferred method of interpretation \n        by Augustine and was dominant in Catholicism throughout the Middle Ages. \n        It is also used by Amillennialists (those not believing in the establishment \n        of a literal millennial kingdom) in their interpretation of unfulfilled \n        prophecy. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><i>Examples</i></p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Origen interpreted Noah's Ark to have 3 meanings (literal, moral, and \n        spiritual) to correspond to man's body, soul and spirit: salvation from \n        the Flood, salvation of the believer from a specific sin, and salvation \n        of the church through Christ. </li>\n      <li>Popes used this method to uphold papal supremacy. Innocent III (~1215AD) \n        said the two great lights in Gen.1 refer respectively to the order of \n        authority on earth. Thus, the sun symbolized spiritual authority (i.e., \n        the pope) and the moon symbolized civil authority (i.e., the emperor). \n        Boniface VIII (pope 1294-1303) interpreted the two swords held by the \n        disciples (Luke 22) to mean that the apostles were authoritative in both \n        the secular and spiritual kingdoms. </li>\n      <li>Numerology - Assigning spiritual significance to numbers used in the \n        Bible (e.g., \"666\" stands for the satanic Trinity; \"3\" \n        and \"7\" represents God; Hebrew letters have numerical value \n        which \"proves\" inspiration). Unless the Bible specifically explains \n        the meaning of numbers, we are speculating. </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><i>Critique</i></p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Since there is no objective standard to which the interpreter must bow, \n        the final authority ceases to be the Scripture and becomes the interpreter. \n      </li>\n      <li>Allegorical interpretation is only rarely seen in Scripture (Gal. 4:21-31; \n        1 Cor. 10:1-4). Parables are usually not allegories. Allegories are usually \n        narratives in which every detail has a corresponding spiritual significance. \n        Parables are local-color stories which illustrate one main spiritual truth. \n      </li>\n      <li>When would allegorical interpretation be allowable? Only when the biblical \n        authors explain it (as in Gal.&#xA0;4 and 1&#xA0;Cor.&#xA0;10). </li>\n    </ul>\n  </blockquote>\n  <h3> Literalistic </h3>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><i>Definition</i></p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Every word is taken absolutely literally including figures of speech \n        and symbolism.

Extreme \n        Fundamentalists and many cults (Children of God, Jehovah Witnesses, Mormons, \n        etc. also use it). </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><i>Examples</i></p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>The Mormons say God has a body because of references to God's \"eye\", \n        \"hand\", etc. However, see Ps. 91:1-4 &#x97; Does this mean He also \n        has feathers and wings? </li>\n      <li>Roman Catholic interpretation of Lk. 22:19 leads to the doctrine of \n        transubstantiation. \n        <blockquote> \n          <p>19 And when He had taken some bread and given thanks, He broke it, \n            and gave it to them, saying, \"This is My body which is given \n            for you; do this in remembrance of Me.\"</p>\n        </blockquote>\n      </li>\n      <li>Jehovah's Witnesses use Col. 1:15 to prove that Christ was a created \n        being. \n        <blockquote> \n          <p>15 And He is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of all \n            creation.</p>\n        </blockquote>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><i>Critique</i></p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Subscribers always use it selectively (see the above examples). </li>\n      <li>It makes the Scripture unintelligible, contradictory, and unlivable \n        (i.e., Lk. 14:26) </li>\n    </ul>\n  </blockquote>\n  <h3> Rationalistic </h3>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><i>Definition</i></p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>The naturalistic worldview (i.e. the universe is a closed system of cause \n        and effect) is the standard by which Scripture must be interpreted. Scripture \n        is intelligible only as ancient man's attempt to explain God. The interpreter's \n        task is to strip away the supernatural elements of the Bible to find \"truth\". \n      </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><i>History</i></p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>This system arose during the Renaissance (16th Century) and the Enlightenment \n        (18th Century). It formed the basis of Liberal hermeneutics. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><i>Examples</i></p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Miracles are rejected as primitive explanations or myths. </li>\n      <li>Thomas Jefferson's 4 gospels cut out all miraculous elements. </li>\n      <li>In regard to Christ, the goal is to rediscover the \"true record\" \n        (i.e., the Quest for the Historical Jesus/ Jesus Seminar) within the \"legendary\" \n        accounts of the gospels. Usually the result is the identification of Jesus \n        as a \"good moral teacher.\" </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><i>Critique</i></p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>It makes a totally unproved worldview the final authority. </li>\n      <li>The attempt to separate the historical from the mythical has been proven \n        to be impossible (e.g., 1 Cor 15). </li>\n    </ul>\n  </blockquote>\n  <h3> Neo-Orthodox </h3>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><i>Definition</i></p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>The religious experience of the interpreter is the main focus and the \n        Bible stimulates such an experience. The Bible <i>in itself</i> is not \n        God's revelation, but it <i>becomes</i> God's revelation when someone \n        accepts it through faith. Interpretation is thus seen primarily as a personal \n        encounter with God. Also, because the <i>words</i> of scripture are not \n        as important as an encounter, much historical and factual information \n        in the Bible could be false according to this view. </p>\n      <p>Inerrancy and infallibility are denied. \"All historical and orthodox \n        forms of <i>inspiration </i>are denied.\" </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><i>History</i></p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>One of the chief proponents of this school was Karl Barth (<i>Romerbrief \n        </i>at the end of WW I) in the first half of the 20th century. He tried \n        to get away from the anti-supernatural bias of Liberal theology (hence \n        the name \"Neo-orthodox\").

Wieman: \"After the crucifixion came the resurrection. The \n        resurrection was an experience the disciples had three days after the \n        terrible shock of Jesus' death on the cross. It took that long for the \n        numbness of the shock to wear off so that they could again respond to \n        one another and to the past in the way that they had done in the living \n        fellowship with Jesus. So vivid and so powerful was this recovery of (their) \n        interchange with one another&#x85;that it produced the feeling of his \n        actual presence with them in bodily form. Many have had this experience \n        after the death of someone deeply involved in their lives. Either they \n        had this psychological illusion...or, what is more likely, when they tried \n        to tell of their experience, the only way they could tell it was in words \n        that led others to think that they were speaking of (a bodily resurrection). \n        This would be most likely to happen after the story had passed through \n        many mouths in an age that believed bodies rose from the dead.\" \"The \n        Revelation of God in Christ,\" <i>Process Studies 10</i>, cited in \n        Gordon Lewis and Bruce Demarest, ed., Challenges to Inerrancy (Chicago: \n        Moody Press, 1984), p. 271</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><i>Critique</i></p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>The separation of \"truth\" from the words of scripture leads \n        to subjective interpretation without any objective controls.

Allegorizing occurs frequently, particularly with the use \n        of the Old Testament. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <h3> Ideological Interpretation (Postmodernism)</h3>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><i>Definition</i></p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>Ideological interpreters approach the Bible looking for material relevant \n        to their ideology. They usually are open about the fact that they have \n        an agenda, and usually claim they are correcting oversights from earlier \n        years by focusing on their area of interest. Most ideological readers \n        also entertain a reader-centered hermeneutic. They are skeptical about \n        ever knowing what the author intended to say, and focus instead on how \n        the text affects the modern reader. </p>\n      <p>Deconstruction - Postmodern readers see the Bible, not as teaching liberation, \n        but as a tool used for exploitation. They would say the Bible is propaganda \n        intended to show why patriarchy (for example) is appropriate. The authors \n        of Scripture sought to legitimize the status quo of society by teaching \n        people to obey their authorities. They also sought to justify aggrandizement \n        of the state of Israel and the subjugation of neighboring peoples. </p>\n      <p>Sound hermeneutics seek to decrease reader bias through the application \n        of rules, which introduce objectivity to the interpretive process. But \n        these ideological and reader-centered methods hold that this objectivity \n        is never possible, because the text was never objective in the first place. \n        The first act of interpretation was the author's decision about what to \n        include and what to exclude in his text. Also, the uncertainty of language \n        means modern readers might as well supply their own interpretation, because \n        we will never know what the \"true\" interpretation should be. \n        To hold to such a thing as a \"true\" or \"real\" interpretation \n        is naive, because such faith fails to take into account the arbitrary \n        nature of language and the social forces which distort people's (both \n        readers and author's) view of the world. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><i>History </i></p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>The \"New Criticism\" advanced in the 1940's began to focus on \n        text and reader rather than on the author. The author has no more authority \n        over the meaning of the text than anyone else because: 1) He didn't realize \n        his own bias at the time he wrote, and 2) We have no way to read his mind \n        and thus know his intentions. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><i>Examples</i></p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Feminist Theology- seeks to study women in the Bible, and to demonstrate \n        that the more enlightened speakers in Scripture were anti-patriarchy. \n        In general, their studies are intended to explode the myth of patriarchy \n        and to uncover cruelty to women. Some advance gender-neutral language \n        in translation, including God as \"she,\" sometimes based on lady \n        wisdom Prov. 1:20ff. </li>\n      <li>Marxist or Liberation Theology- seeks to show that the true intent of \n        God in the Bible is to teach that poor and oppressed classes should be \n        liberated from their oppression by the love of God. They tend to interpret \n        redemptive language in terms of economics and political power. They see \n        class struggle in much of the conflict in the Bible. </li>\n      <li>Gay Theology - seeks to show examples of homosexual relationships (David \n        &amp; Jonathan; Jesus &amp; John) that have been de-emphasized because \n        of the heterosexual bias of the biblical authors.

The answer to this question is surprisingly simple: <i>Because \n      another authority has replaced God's Word.</i> They have made either official \n      or unofficial additions to the canon.

INTERPRET GRAMMATICALLY:</b> Take the normal meaning of the words, \n    phrases and sentences unless it is impossible to do so. The interpretation \n    must correspond to the words and grammar in the text in a reasonable way. \n    Otherwise, there is no objective control over the interpreter (EXAMPLES: see \n    \"Hermeneutical Schools\"). Most of the Bible can be interpreted by \n    simply taking the language (either in the original or in translation) in the \n    usual way. In other words, \"If the plain sense makes sense, seek no other \n    sense.\"</p>\n  <p>Qualifications: </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><b>Allow for figures of speech.</b> A plain sense reading should not be \n      confused with a literalistic interpretation. \n      <blockquote> \n        <p>Psa. 91:4 He will cover you with His pinions, And under His wings you \n          may seek refuge; His faithfulness is a shield and bulwark.</p>\n        <p>Lk. 22:19 - \" . . . this is my body . . . \" Where was Jesus' \n          body when he said this? See his other metaphors (door; bread; etc.). \n        </p>\n        <p>Col.&#xA0;1:15 - \"&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;the first-born of \n          all creation&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;\" The Old Testament sometimes \n          uses this term to refer to \"heir\" (Ex. 4:22; Jer.&#xA0;31:9). \n          Heb.&#xA0;1:6,7 uses it to refer to Jesus as the object of angelic worship. \n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n    </li>\n    <li> <b>Allow for symbolism. </b>If a passage is symbolic or contains symbols, \n      this should be indicated in the text, either by textual cues or because \n      symbolism is required in order to make sense of the text. The Bible itself \n      explains most symbols. \n      <blockquote> \n        <p>Rev. 1:9-20 - The symbols are identified as such (\"like\") \n          and explained. Most of biblical symbols are handled this way. Many other \n          symbols in Revelation have been previously explained in Daniel. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><b>2. INTERPRET HISTORICALLY:</b> Historical interpretation means that we \n    take into account the historical background of the author and the recipients. \n    We are not interested at first in the question, \"What does it mean to \n    me?\" but rather, \"What did it mean to the original audience?\" \n    Use Bible dictionaries, encyclopedias, commentaries, or other sources to learn \n    more about customs, money, geography, etc. We need to ascertain the original \n    intent before we apply any biblical teaching.</p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Gen. 15:7-21 - \"Cutting a covenant\" solemnized a contract between \n      two parties. It was normally bilateral (both parties walked through), but \n      only God goes through &gt;&gt; GRACE COVENANT. </p>\n    <p>1 Cor. 11:4-6 - Shorn hair was typical of Aphrodite priestess-prostitutes; \n      shaven heads were typical of convicted adulteresses (vs. 5). </p>\n    <p>The parable of the Good Samaritan (Lk. 10), 300 Denarii (John 12:3-5), \n      50,000 Drachma (Acts 19:19). </p>\n    <p>Pharisees' teaching on the relationship between illness and sin (Mk. 2) \n    </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><b>3. INTERPRET CRITICALLY:</b> Your interpretation must make rational sense. \n    The entire Bible is the product of one author (God) at the same time that \n    it is the product of many authors. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect a \n    consistent message throughout the Bible. Some of these rules are logical implications \n    of a belief in the verbal plenary inspiration of scripture. </p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>FIVE PRACTICAL RULES - These rules will help you to arrive at a critically \n      sound interpretation. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <ol>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>a. <i>Interpret in light of the context of the passage (which author? \n        book? passage?).</i> Never view a passage in isolation from its surroundings. \n        <i>The context should be considered the most important kind of evidence \n        in the interpretation of a passage.</i> Only when no critically feasible \n        interpretation can be found can we claim that a break in context was intended. \n      </p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p>Mt. 16:28 - Referring to the transfiguration (in context of passage) \n          \"Truly I say to you, there are some of those who are standing here \n          who shall not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His \n          kingdom.\" <br>\n          2 Peter 1:16- confirms that Peter was an eye witness of Christ's \"majesty.\"</p>\n        <p>Jas. 1:6-8 - The \"doubter\" is not simply any Christian who \n          has occasional doubts. He is the \"double-minded man,\" whom \n          James further describes in 4:8 (in context of book) as Christians who \n          posture themselves as loving God but really love the world. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p><i>b. Interpret in light of progressive revelation </i> </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n<ol>\n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <blockquote> \n        <blockquote>\n          <p><i>(Heb. 1:1,2).</i> God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers \n            in the prophets in many portions and in many ways, in these last days \n            has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, \n            through whom also He made the world. </p>\n          <p>Heb 8:13 When He said, \"A new covenant,\" He has made the \n            first obsolete. But whatever is becoming obsolete and growing old \n            is ready to disappear. </p>\n        </blockquote>\n        <p>While God's purpose for man has never changed, his strategy in accomplishing \n          that purpose has changed. He has dealt with man under different \"covenants,\" \n          or \"dispensations.\" Therefore, it is important to ask, \"Under \n          which program was this written?\" Primary application of the passage \n          will be to the people operating under that program, but not necessarily \n          to others. There may be secondary applications for other programs based \n          on principles which have universal application. </p>\n        <blockquote>\n          <p>Ex. 20:8-10 \"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six \n            days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is \n            a Sabbath of the LORD your God; in it you shall not do any work, you \n            or your son or your daughter, your male or your female servant or \n            your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you.\" </p>\n        </blockquote>\n        <p>Animal sacrifices, dietary laws, Sabbaths, holy days, festivals, priests \n          and liturgy have all been fulfilled in Christ and are thus obsolete \n          (compare with Col. 2:16,17 \"Therefore let no one act as your judge \n          in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon \n          or a Sabbath day&#x97; 17 things which are a mere shadow of what is \n          to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.\" and Heb. 8). </p>\n        <blockquote>\n          <p>Theocracy was commanded in the Old Testament, but secular government \n            is affirmed in the New Testament (Rom. 13:1-7; Mt. 22:21). </p>\n          <p>Mal. 3:7-12 - The practice of tithes should be seen in context of \n            the Old Testament (see Num. 18:21-24; Deut. 14:22-29) </p>\n        </blockquote>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p>c. <i>Interpret scripture in harmony with other scripture. </i>Since \n        the Bible is inspired by God, it does not contradict itself. Therefore, \n        never interpret scripture in such a way that it clearly contradicts other \n        scriptures. If a passage can be legitimately interpreted in more than \n        one way, choose the interpretation that doesn't contradict other scriptures. \n      </p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p>Go back to the initial example of Mark 12:31- \"Love your neighbor \n          as yourself.\" We must interpret this passage in harmony with Jesus' \n          other teachings.</p>\n        <p>Acts 2:38 could be referring to either baptismal regeneration, or simply \n          adding baptism as a desirable adjunct to the minimum requirement for \n          salvation (i.e., faith). In view of the clear teaching on salvation \n          by grace through faith alone, the latter interpretation is preferable. \n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p><i>d. Interpret the unclear in light of the clear.</i> Every major, essential \n        truth is taught clearly and many times. Never build a doctrine on an unclear \n        passage. </p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p>Lk. 16:9 \"And I say to you, make friends for yourselves by means \n          of the mammon of unrighteousness; that when it fails, they may receive \n          you into the eternal dwellings.\" . . . is used by Roman Catholics \n          to support indulgences.</p>\n        <p>1 Cor. 15:29 \"Otherwise, what will those do who are baptized for \n          the dead?

In this class, we'll begin with an inductive study of Philemon, \n    an epistle.</p>\n  <p><b>Inductive Overview of an Epistle</b></p>\n  <p>An inductive overview will help you grasp the big picture, the main themes \n    of the book you are studying. It will help you discover: </p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>... the life situation of the author and the people he is writing to</p>\n    <p>... the flow of thought in the book</p>\n    <p>... the general theme(s) of the letter and why the letter was written. \n    </p>\n    <p>The overview will not provide deeper insight into a particular doctrine, \n      nor will it reveal how to apply an individual passage to your own life. \n      But it will give you the background needed to understand individual passages. \n      We'll learn how to do a paragraph study next week, which will help us get \n      into the meaning and application of a particular text. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p>How to do an inductive overview of an epistle: </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p><b>A. Paragraph titles:</b> Read the book all the way through, writing \n      down titles for each paragraph. This reveals the general thought development \n      of the book. Titles should meet the following requirements: </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><b>The titles should be short.</b> No sentences are allowed. A phrase \n        of a few words is the maximum length. We are not writing synopses. This \n        will force us to get the main idea clearly fixed in our minds. </li>\n      <li><b>The titles should cover all of the significant content in the paragraph.</b> \n        If there is subject matter that is not covered in your title, you need \n        revision. </li>\n      <li><b>Decide how you will determine where the paragraph divisions belong.</b> \n        If studying with a study group, it is probably best to stay with the existing \n        paragraphs. However, if convenient, it is often correct to divide the \n        paragraphs in a different location than those used in any particular version. \n        Feel free to discuss where the divisions should be, and why. (Remember \n        that they are not inspired, and are different from one version to another). \n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><b>B. Identity and situation of the author, audience, and 3rd parties:</b> \n      Compile all the references to the author, audience and key third parties. \n      This is usually done by drawing three or more columns on a sheet of <br>\n      paper - one for the author, one for the audience, and one or more for key \n      third parties that the author mentions. The audience is the individual or \n      group of people that the letter is written to. Key third parties are people \n      (not God, angels, Satan, etc.) that the author mentions more than once in \n      his letter. Examples of third parties include false teachers and individuals \n      that are singled out for discussion (e.g. Euodia and Syntyche in Phil. 4; \n      Hymenaeus and Alexander in 1 Timothy 1). The data should be referenced with \n      the chapter and verse, and marked with an asterisk if the insight is implied \n      rather than directly stated. The implied data are less conclusive in reconstructing \n      the historical situation. Once all the data is gathered, write a one paragraph \n      <b>summary of the historical situation</b> of the author, audience and any \n      third parties. </p>\n    <p><b>C. Major themes:</b> Review your paragraph titles and note repeated \n      ideas, words, and themes. What are the major issues/themes that the author \n      is addressing? </p>\n    <p><b>D. Why was the letter written?</b> Record your conclusions about the \n      author's reason(s) for writing the book.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><b>Paragraph study (see next week) </b></p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>This is the 2nd part of the inductive study method for Epistles and will \n      be covered next week (though your handout includes both sections so that \n      you understand the continuity between the two).</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p>Tonight we'll practice performing an inductive overview on the book of Philemon. \n    On your homework due next week, you'll be asked to write an inductive overview \n    of the book of Titus. </p>\n  <p>For your benefit, this assignment is non-optional. To pass this course you \n    must complete it. </p>\n  <p><b>Philemon: Inductive Overview</b></p>\n  <h4>1. Paragraph Titles</h4>\n  <h4>2.

Biblical anthropology focuses on the Bible's revelation about\n  humans, especially our <i>original design </i>(CREATION), our <i>present abnormal state </i>(FALL),\n  and the <i>effect of our salvation </i>through Christ (REDEMPTION). We will focus on the\n  first two areas tonight; the third area will be covered extensively later . . . </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Importance: </strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>It helps us understand more about God, since we\n      are created in God's image. </li>\n    <li>It helps us understand sanctification, since\n      Christians are \"being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the One\n      who created him\" (Col. 3:10). It also helps us to manage our expectations about\n      perfectionism in this life, realizing we won't be fully restored to God's image until we\n      are with him. </li>\n    <li>How we view human nature will affect practical\n      areas like PARENTING (discipline), DELEGATED AUTHORITY (its importance in a fallen world),\n      SOCIAL ETHICS (sexuality; abortion; euthanasia), PSYCHOLOGY (our main problem), our\n      response to SUFFERING, etc. </li>\n    <li>It helps us understand contradictions we see in\n      people (both noble qualities and wickedness). People are made in God's image, but deeply\n      fallen.&#xA0; If we only see people's fallenness we can justify mistreating them.&#xA0; On\n      the other hand if we only see the image of God, then we are unable to see that they need\n      God's truth.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3><strong><a name=\"a2\"></a>Creation and Fall (Gen 1:26-3:7) </strong></h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What is the significance of the tree of the\n  knowledge of good and evil? It's not a story about a magical fruit. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil represented the choice to trust God to\n  define good and evil versus arrogating that choice to ourselves (\"become like\n  God\").&#xA0; In this sense, Satan's promise that eating it would make them like God\n  (3:5) was true (see God's affirmation of this in 3:22)--but it also was an act of\n  rebellion against God's loving rulership which had disastrous consequences for Adam and\n  Eve and all their descendants . . .</p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><strong>Teacher's Note: </strong>(Not \n      presented to class) There is no special attention given to the tree and \n      subsequent discussion of this event in the Bible focuses on the morality \n      of Adam and Eve's decision. The forbidden fruit did not offer experiential \n      knowledge of evil. If this were the case then God would also have experiential \n      knowledge of evil. This would contradict one of God's attributes we covered \n      last week: righteousness. For an fuller discussion on this, see <i>Genesis \n      in Space in Time</i>, Francis A. Schaeffer, pp. 71-80.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</blockquote>\n\n<h3><strong><a name=\"a3\"></a>Federal Headship</strong></h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n          <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The choice of the head affects all of his \n            descendants. Adam&#x92;s choices affected all of humanity, and Jesus&#x92; \n            choices affect all who descend spiritually from him. Rom. 5:12-19** \n            teaches this principle most clearly. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><strong>Scriptural Support </strong></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>(Romans 5:12-19)&#xA0; Therefore, just as through one man sin entered\n      into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all\n      sinned-- (13) for until the Law sin was in the world; but sin is not imputed when there is\n      no law. (14) Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not\n      sinned in the likeness of the offense of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come. (15)\n      But the free gift is not like the transgression. For if by the transgression of the one\n      the many died, much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man,\n      Jesus Christ, abound to the many. (16) And the gift is not like that which came through\n      the one who sinned; for on the one hand the judgment arose from one transgression\n      resulting in condemnation, but on the other hand the free gift arose from many\n      transgressions resulting in justification. (17) For if by the transgression of the one,\n      death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of\n      the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ. (18) So then\n      as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so through one\n      act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men. (19) For as through\n      the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of\n      the One the many will be made righteous.</p>\n      \n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<dir>\n\n\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><strong>Because we all descend from Adam, we reap the consequences of Adam's choice.</strong></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</dir>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>Vs 12: \" . . . death spread to all men\n      because all sinned\" </p>\n      <p>Vs 15a: \" . . . by the transgression of the\n      one the many died . . . \"; </p>\n      <p>Vs 17a: \" . . . by the transgression of the\n      one, <i>death</i> reigned through the one . . . \" </p>\n      <p>Vs 18a: \" . . . through one transgression\n      there resulted <i>condemnation</i> to all men . . . \" </p>\n      <p>Vs 19a: \" . . . through the one man's\n      disobedience the many were <i>made sinners</i> . . . \"</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><strong>What are these consequences? </strong></p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p><strong>(1) Sin nature (vs 19a) (2) physical death (12, 15a) (3) separation from God\n      (spiritual death- 17).</strong> Many other passages confirm that mankind reaps the\n      consequences of Adam's sin: </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p><strong>(1 Cor. 15:21,22)</strong> \"For\n      since by a man came death, by a man also came the resurrection of the dead.

We expend enormous mental energy on how to\n      manipulate, deceive, intimidate others, etc. (see 2 Peter 2:3,10b, 13, 18)</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p><strong>(Rom. 1:21,22,28,32)</strong>&#xA0; For even though they knew\n        God, they did not honor Him as God, or give thanks; but they became futile in their\n        speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened.

Those who accuse the Bible of being responsible for western\n      civilization's rape of the environment misunderstand it. It affirms the legitimacy of\n      human dominion over nature, but that dominion is defined as a stewardship to be managed\n      with love and respect for the environment. The Old Testament prohibited cruelty to\n      animals. But note: human dominion over nature was contingent to humans remaining under\n      God's rulership. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><strong>After: </strong></p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p><strong>Nature is now in an abnormal, \"futile\" state because humans are not\n      in right relationship with God</strong> (Gen.&#xA0;3:17a; Rom. 8:19-21). This is the\n      answer to \"natural evil\"--suffering not caused <i>directly</i> by wrong choices\n      (NATURAL DISASTERS; DISEASES; GENETIC DEFECTS).

For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are\n        established by God. Therefore he who resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God;\n        and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves. For rulers are not a\n        cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority?\n        Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same; for it is a minister of God to\n        you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for\n        nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath upon the one who\n        practices evil. Wherefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath,\n        but also for conscience' sake.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p><b>Marriage and Family (Gen. 3:16)</b></p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p><strong>(Col.3:18-21) </strong>Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is\n        fitting in the Lord.

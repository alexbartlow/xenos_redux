If he does nothing all day he will \n      be of little use to you, it is true, but at least he will do no damage that \n      way. But if you say to him: \"Now come along, don't idle away your time: \n      get up and do something,\" then immediately the trouble begins. He knocks \n      the chair over as he gets up, stumbles over a footstool a few paces further \n      on, then smashes some precious dish as soon as he handles it. If you make \n      no demands upon him his clumsiness is never noticed, but as soon as you \n      ask him to do anything his awkwardness is apparent at once. The demands \n      were all right, but the man was all wrong. He was as clumsy a man when he \n      was sitting still as when he was working, but it was your demands that made \n      manifest the clumsiness which, whether he was active or inactive, all the \n      time were in his make-up.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n  <ul>\n    <p>We are all sinners by nature. If \n      God asks nothing of us, all seems to go well, but as soon as he demands \n      something of us, the occasion is provided for a grand display of our sinfulness. \n      The Law makes our weakness manifest. While you let me sit still I appear \n      to be all right, but when you ask me to do anything I am sure to spoil it, \n      and if you trust me with a second thing I will as surely spoil that also. \n      When a holy law is applied to a sinful, man, then it is that his sinfulness \n      comes out in full display. </p>\n    <p>God knows who I am: he knows that \n      from head to foot I am full of sin; he knows that I am weakness incarnate; \n      that I can do nothing. The trouble is that I do not know it [last week's \n      topic: <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu2w3.htm\">our new identity</a>]. I admit that all men \n      are sinners, and that therefore I am a sinner; but I imagine that I am not \n      such a hopeless sinner as some. God must bring us all to the place where \n      we see that we are utterly weak and helpless. While we say so, we do not \n      wholly believe it, and God has to do something to convince us of the fact.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu2w4.htm#Footnote2B\">Footnote2B</a></p>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Therefore, if we want to be deeply \n      fruitful, we're going to need to develop an appreciation for just how deeply \n      sinful we really are.

Many Christians also are inclined to think that sin is a rare exception \n        in their lives.

In concentrating on actions, we \n        uncover only the tip of the iceberg. Overlooked are our sinful attitudes, \n        the continuing resistance to God's will which give rise to actions. Biblical \n        definitions of sin give much more prominence to attitudes or continuous \n        patterns of behavior than to isolated acts.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu2w4.htm#Footnote3B\">Footnote3B</a> \n        </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </ul>\n \n  <p>Healthy, growing Christians therefore \n    experience a strange paradox: </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <ul>\n      <li>On the one hand, we (and others) \n        gradually see a definite improvement in our moral lives in many areas. \n        </li>\n      <li>But on the other hand, we realize \n        how much more deeply sinful we are than we initially realized. </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As we grow, God keeps peeling off \n      layer after layer, revealing new areas and levels of sin.

In its biblical definition, sin cannot be limited \n      to isolated instances or patterns of wrongdoing; it is something much more \n      akin to the psychological term complex: an organic network of compulsive \n      attitudes, beliefs, and behavior deeply rooted in alienation from God. Sin \n      originated in the darkening of the human mind and heart as man turned from \n      the truth about God to embrace a lie about him and consequently a whole \n      universe of lies about his creation. Sinful thoughts, words and deeds flow \n      forth from this darkened heart automatically and compulsively, as water \n      from a polluted fountain.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu2w4.htm#Footnote9B\">Footnote9B</a></p>\n    <p>(Larry Crabb)&#xA0; \"Many pastors \n      preach an `iceberg' view of sin.

Like a naive sea captain steering his vessel around \n      the tip of the iceberg with no awareness that there is a mountain of ice \n      beneath the surface that could wreck his ship, Christian (leaders) are too \n      often satisfied when their people turn from church-defined sins of behavior.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu2w4.htm#Footnote10B\">Footnote10B</a></p>\n    <p>(Charles Spurgeon) &#xA0; \"In \n      the Lateran Council of the Church of Rome [1215AD], a decree was passed \n      that every true believer must confess his sins, all of them, once in a year \n      to the priest, and they affixed to it this declaration, that there is no \n      hope of pardon but in complying with that decree. What can equal the absurdity \n      of such a decree as that? Do they suppose that they can tell their sins \n      as easily as they can count their fingers? Why, if we could receive pardon \n      for all our sins by telling every sin we have committed in one hour, there \n      is not one of us who would be able to enter heaven, since, besides the sins \n      that are known to us and that we may be able to confess, there are a vast \n      mass of sins, which are as truly sins as those which we lament, but which \n      are secret, and come not beneath our eyes&#x85;The transgressions which \n      we see and confess are but like the farmer's small samples which he brings \n      to the market, when he has left his granary full at home.

Nevertheless \n      we can make substantial progress in areas of temperamental weakness. We \n      should not condemn ourselves in the non-strengths, but accept and embrace \n      God-given diversity in one another&#x97;much like spiritual gifts.

If we do this, we will continue to grow regardless of how people \n        treat us, and we will eventually have much better relationships! </p>\n     \n      <blockquote>  \n        <p>(Matthew 7:3-5) And why do you look at the speck that is in your brother's \n          eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? (4) Or how can \n          you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' and \n          behold, the log is in your own eye?

The true Christian's nostril is to be continually attentive \n      to the inner cesspool.&#xA0; Another \n      author, quoted in Haller's <i>Rise of Puritanism, </i>says that when he \n      looked into his heart, it was \"as if I had in the heat of summer looked \n      down into the Filth of a Dungeon, where I discerned Millions of crawling \n      living things in the midst of that Sink and liquid Corruption.'&#xA0; (C. \n      S.

Can he be right? \n      It sounds so very unlike the New Testament fruits of the spirit&#x97;love, \n      joy, peace. And very unlike the Pauline programme: 'forgetting those things \n      which are behind and reaching forth unto those things that are before.'&#x85;I \n      know that a spiritual emetic at the right moment may be needed.

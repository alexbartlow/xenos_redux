It is designed to help individuals recognize ways in which God has empowered\nthem to build up the body of Christ. We have defined twenty-three gifts, but this is not\nan exhaustive list. </p>\n\n<p>As you read through each gift description, reflect on where God may have gifted you.\nHave people in your Home Church been encouraging you in any of these areas? Do your\nstrengths in ministry correlate well with a particular gift? You may also want to think\nabout potential areas of gifting in the lives of your close Christian friends. </p>\n\n<p>Speaking Gifts and Serving Gifts The gifts described in this paper fall into two\ncategories: speaking gifts and service gifts. </p>\n\n<p>Speaking gifts require building a reputation of proven faithfulness. It is important to\nbuild relationships with integrity before you have a platform in which to express these\ngifts. It is not enough to say, \"I have a gift of teaching so I want to teach.\"\nWe first need to establish a proven record of service. Some speaking gifts require a long\nmaturing process and education before they can be fully expressed. Speaking gifts include\nevangelism, prophecy and teaching. </p>\n\n<p>Service gifts often have a lower profile and less visible effect than speaking gifts.\nThey are typically exercised in supporting roles that are more \"behind the\nscenes.\" Sometimes people with service gifts think that what they do and where\nthey're gifted isn't all that important. God thinks differently. Christians need to agree\nwith Him about the vital importance of service gifting in the purpose of His church.\nService gifts include helps, giving and mercy. </p>\n\n<p>Distinctives and Cautions The description of each gift in this paper will include\ndistinctives and cautions. Distinctives are personality traits that may help you recognize\na gift in yourself or someone else. Cautions are errant tendencies common in the lives of\nindividuals who exercise a particular gift. </p>\n\n<p><strong>ADMINISTRATION:</strong> The spiritual capability to understand what makes an\norganization function, and the special ability to plan and execute procedures that\nincrease the church's organizational effectiveness. (1 Corinthians 12:28) </p>\n\n<p>Distinctives: A person with this gift understands the practical steps that need to be\ntaken in order to realize a given objective. Gifted administrators are committed to\neffectiveness and efficiency. They can look at a situation and bring order to chaos,\nkeeping the overall picture in mind. Administrators are needed who can \"steward\"\nthe resources of the local church. These resources include money, buildings, staff, and\nvolunteers. Though a person with this gift is mostly behind the scenes, they enable the\n\"up front\" ministries and gifts to be more efficient and effective. </p>\n\n<p>Cautions: If you have this gift, be careful that you don't stifle the activity of the\nHoly Spirit in your own life. Good administrators are willing to make a course change if\nthe leadership calls for a shift in plans. This requires a submissive spirit to\nleadership. There is a danger among administrative people to \"use\" others to\nreach a goal. Don't merely strive for the ends; appreciate what God wants to do through\nthe means. Remember that all people are in a process. </p>\n\n<p><strong>APOSTLESHIP:</strong> The spiritual capability to start churches and oversee\ntheir development. (1Corinthians 12:28; Ephesians 4:11) </p>\n\n<p>Distinctives: Likened to modern day missionaries, a person with this gift has a heart\nto preach the gospel to people in a different cultural setting who haven't heard the\nGospel. They have a desire to go across cultures and may enjoy starting new churches.\n\"Cross-cultural\" work can include inner city or international ministries. The\nauthority of the apostle is based on the Word and the body of believers that sends them\nout. </p>\n\n<p>Cautions: You may desire to cut a new path before you are ready to move away from your\npresent ministry efforts. Make certain that there are appropriate provisions for the\npeople that God has entrusted you in your present ministry. </p>\n\n<p><strong>COUNSELING:</strong> The spiritual capability to effectively listen to people\nand assist them in their quest for psychological and relational wholeness. </p>\n\n<p>Distinctives: People with this gift have excellent listening skills. They tend to be\nvery approachable while maintaining the ability to convey difficult truths in a loving\nway. They empathize, but also offer constructive advice, devising a plan of action toward\nwholeness and holding others accountable to take needed steps to that end. </p>\n\n<p>Cautions: Distinguish between having a gift and having a burden in this area. Some have\na real heart for hurting people, and desire to help them through their pain. But those who\nhave a passion to help may or may not be gifted counselors. People who have undergone\ncounseling often develop skills in this area, but this is not the same as being a gifted\ncounselor. </p>\n\n<p>Inexperienced counselors often offer quick, trite answers to difficult problems. It is\nalso common to read our own experiences into someone else's life. Make every effort to\nensure it is God's wisdom you are providing, not your own opinion. Counselors should also\nkeep the final objective in mind: helping people enjoy a healthy walk with the Lord and\nserve others in love. </p>\n\n<p><strong>CRAFTSMANSHIP:</strong> The spiritual capability to enhance ministry through\nthe creative construction of necessary tools for ministry. (Exodus 31) </p>\n\n<p>Distinctives: A person with this gift is a hands-on person. He or she may be a builder,\narchitect, designer; someone who enhances ministry by his other unique skills. The gift\ncan be expressed in carpentry, metalworking, and other constructive skills. </p>\n\n<p>Cautions: If you have this gift, don't belittle your contribution as insignificant or\nnot spiritual because it's so tangible. Don't separate your opportunities to personally\nminister to people from the ministry project that you're working on. </p>\n\n<p><strong>CREATIVE COMMUNICATION:</strong> The spiritual capability to communicate God's\ntruth through a variety of art forms. (The Holy Spirit's expression is in various forms in\nthe Bible - poetry, song, narrative, parable, metaphor, etc.) </p>\n\n<p>Distinctives: A person with this gift is very creative and imaginative. This person is\nable to communicate truths in unique ways from a variety of angles. They tend to be visual\nthinkers. Areas of ministry include programming, sound, lighting, video, drama, music,\netc. Public announcements of events may be an application, with the ability to design\nattractive and catchy flyers to attract more people to events. </p>\n\n<p>Cautions: Be careful not to be artsy for art's sake. Use your gift to promote God and\nhis kingdom, not yourself. Creative communicators stray when they try to create and do\nthings that enamor people with the art form and the artist rather than the message. </p>\n\n<p>Creative communicators need to be flexible and willing to submit to the wishes of the\npeople around them. Sometimes they aren't team players. This is an area that God will\naddress. The fact that you have visible talents where others don't does not mean you\nshould have full say in music, drama, or other artistic areas. </p>\n\n<p><strong>DISCERNMENT:</strong> The spiritual capability to distinguish between truth and\nerror, and to identify deception in character and in relationships. (1 Corinthians 12:10,\n\"distinguishing between spirits.\") </p>\n\n<p>Distinctives: Discernment is a keen sense of insight that enables someone to recognize\npotential or actual problems in relationships, imbalance in teachings, the presence of\ndemonic activity, or misuse of scripture. Discernment must be based on knowing Biblical\ntruth. Once this person knows the truth, they can clearly pick out problems or important\nsteps that need to be taken. </p>\n\n<p>Cautions: Many of us have known people that are very discerning and perhaps gifted, but\nwhat they do with that discernment is far from God's will. They have great insight, but\nthen take on the role of the Holy Spirit to expose and correct problems in the other\nperson's life on their own time schedule. If you have this gift, learn to use it\nskillfully by seeking help from others who are gifted in wisdom, counseling, and\nshepherding. </p>\n\n<p><strong>ENCOURAGEMENT:</strong> The spiritual capability to reassure, strengthen, and\naffirm those who are discouraged or wavering in their faith. (Romans 12: 8) </p>\n\n<p>Distinctives: A person with this gift urges others to apply the truth in their lives;\nit is not just a gift of friendliness and back-slapping. This person is able to get\nalongside wavering or discouraged people and effectively challenge them to be all they can\nbe spiritually. When you are around these people, you feel like keeping on track and\ncontinuing to fight the good fight. </p>\n\n<p>This person tends to be very positive, full of faith, reassuring to the unstable. They\nalso tend to be results-oriented, concerned with consistency of practice with profession,\nvery practical and pragmatic (\"What works?\"). They tend to be expressive and are\noften viewed as an \"emoter\" by other people. Encouragers understand the\nimportance of emotions, but are concerned with knowing and doing God's will as well. </p>\n\n<p>Cautions: If you have this gift, you may tend to make things too simple. For example,\nwhen someone is hurting, quoting Romans 8:28 (\"and we know that God causes all things\nto work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His\npurpose\") is too simple. This is a great truth but encouragement in a person's walk\nat that moment may not be what's needed. The individual may simply need your company. </p>\n\n<p>Your optimism can make others feel as if you haven't really connected; it makes them\nwonder if you really understand. Take time to learn about what they're going through\nbefore helping to build them up. </p>\n\n<p><strong>EVANGELISM:</strong> The spiritual capability to effectively communicate the\nmessage of Christ to non-Christians so they can respond in faith and move toward\ndiscipleship. (Ephesians 4:11) </p>\n\n<p>Distinctives: A person with this gift has a strong desire to turn conversations to\nspiritual matters and has an instinctive ability to do this. The evangelist's desire to\nshare the Gospel with non-believers is often greater than being involved with the\ngrounding and discipleship of believers. </p>\n\n<p>All Christians are called to witness to non-believers (1 Peter 3:15). The non-gifted\n\"witnesser\" will probably see fewer results and be less \"at home\"\nsharing the Gospel than a gifted evangelist. </p>\n\n<p>Cautions: Avoid stereotypes (as with all the gifts) as to the environment or ministry\nin which this would be used. Most people won't be knocking on doors or using cold-medium\nevangelism. Don't be satisfied with just one approach. Be willing to read about evangelism\nand talk with other Christians about their approach so that God can develop your gift,\nusing it in a variety of ways. Be careful that a critical spirit doesn't emerge because\nother believers aren't speaking to three to five people per week - that is gift\nprojection. You can be hard on others when you don't see them expressing themselves with\nthe same intensity in the areas that you've been gifted. </p>\n\n<p><strong>FAITH:</strong> The spiritual capability to trust God's will and act on it with\nunwavering belief in His ability. (1 Corinthians 12:9) </p>\n\n<p>Distinctives: This gift is often expressed in a strong prayer life. A person with this\ngift lives in constant awareness of the reality of the supernatural as well as the\nnatural. This person is certain that God will bring to pass what He promises and is\ntherefore reliable during trials. He or she can also help others see God working in\ntrials. </p>\n\n<p>Cautions: Remember that faith is active. It isn't only God's work; we must be willing\nto obey His commands. God works through people in reaching the lost and in helping\nChristians grow. If you have this gift, you might look and critique your group, asking,\n\"Why doesn't our group have the vitality I read about in Acts 2? Is it because the\nSpirit is different or absent?\" Recognize that God is at work in all churches and\nthat human action does matter. </p>\n\n<p><strong>GIVING:</strong> The spiritual capability to contribute money and material\nresources to the work of the Lord with cheerfulness and liberality. (Romans 12: 8) </p>\n\n<p>Distinctives: God has given the person with this gift the ability to give well beyond\nnormal levels, either through wealth or faith. God has often blessed this person with\nfinancial ability through increased income or other means in order to build up the Kingdom\nof God. Serving others this way causes a sense of joy, a sense of confidence in leadership\nand a desire to encourage that ministry in others and do it with liberality. All\nChristians are called to give, but some are compelled to give much more. The gifted giver\nis often asking, \"How can I free up the most amount of resources to maximize their\npotential for kingdom use?\" Often gifted givers try to help others to see success in\ntheir own financial stewardship. </p>\n\n<p>Cautions: If you have this gift, you might not see it as a spiritual ministry. Since\nall Christians are called to give, you may believe that you're only doing a perfunctory,\nmandated service. Or you may think that giving money is too tangible to be a spiritual\ngift. Realize that financial resources are necessary in ministry to bring the lost to\nChrist. Be careful that you don't inadvertently use resources for \"personal\nagenda\" giving within the church. Allow the leadership to dispense those resources as\nit sees fit. Be a generous giver and stimulate others to give. </p>\n\n<p><strong>HEALING:</strong> The spiritual capability to be God's channel to restore\npeople to health. (1 Corinthians 12:9) </p>\n\n<p>Distinctives: There are many kinds of healing in the body of Christ. A person with this\ngift is an avenue of God's power for physical healing, emotional healing, or relational\nhealing. They often see God's power released through personal prayer. Healing can include\nthe use of \"natural\" means. Christian hospitals in missions may be in view here.\n</p>\n\n<p>Cautions: Keep this amazing gift in perspective. Although God does miraculously heal,\nthis is not His normative way of working through the church. The Bible is clear that God's\nprimary way of working is through process, such as through His redemptive plan and in\npersonal sanctification. To expect that miraculous healing be normative in the church or\nthat the church should be focused on this ministry is contrary to God's purpose for the\nchurch as expressed in His word to us. </p>\n\n<p><strong>HELPS:</strong> The spiritual ability to attach spiritual value to the\naccomplishment of practical and necessary tasks which support the body of Christ. (Romans\n12:7; 1Corinthians 12:28) </p>\n\n<p>Distinctives: A person with this gift sees the spiritual value of and finds God's\npurposes in the practical aspects of ministry and living. Someone with this gift might\nhelp to maintain a facility or assist a teacher with some household task to free him or\nher up for study. </p>\n\n<p>The gift of helps is a tangible expression of what the non-believing world rejects -\nhelping others for the sheer satisfaction of helping. A person with this gift edifies the\nbody of Christ by supporting others in their pursuit of ministry. Like our Helper, the\nHoly Spirit, gifted helpers derive enjoyment out of serving others. </p>\n\n<p>Cautions: If you have this gift, you may often need help from the leadership to see\nclearly what will be most supportive for the church. You may also struggle with false\nhumility. Because the effects are less dramatic and tangible, the tendency is to undermine\nthe spiritual significance of your gift. The challenge is to think through your acts of\nservice beyond their functional end. (For example, an individual helping clean walls and\npainting in a home to get ready for Home Church.) </p>\n\n<p><strong>HOSPITALITY:</strong> The spiritual capability to personally care for people by\nproviding fellowship, food, or shelter. (1 Peter 4:9) </p>\n\n<p>Distinctives: A person with this gift enjoys providing a caring, warm atmosphere for\nthose whom God is calling to the church. They have an ability to connect with people; they\nprovide environments where people feel welcome. This person tends to gravitate toward\nthose who are standing off to the side, looking confused. A good host loves to have people\nto their home and is more pre-occupied with the comfort of others than the image of their\nhome. This gift is especially needed in a large church. One of the more frequent questions\nasked by newer people is, \"Can a church this size care for me personally?\" </p>\n\n<p>People with the gift of hospitality can have incredible impact on children. As someone\nwith this gift opens up their house for others, their children see the value of fellowship\nand using material blessings as a stewardship for the Lord's work. Of course this doesn't\nmean that they never get time alone with their family at home. </p>\n\n<p>Cautions: If you have this gift, the challenge is to serve without complaint. Struggles\nwith materialism can suppress the expression of this gift. It can be difficult and\ntiresome at times. Regularly reflect on the contribution you are making to the work of\nChrist. </p>\n\n<p><strong>INTERPRETATION:</strong> The spiritual capability to make known to the body the\nmessage of one who is speaking in tongues. (1 Corinthians 12:10) </p>\n\n<p>Distinctives: A person with this gift can communicate clearly and effectively. It is an\nability that is given spontaneously by the Holy Spirit and therefore, unlike most of the\nother gifts, it cannot be developed in the traditional sense. Tongues is a gift given by\nGod primarily for self-edification (1 Corinthians 14:4). This gift allows others to be\nedified as well by interpreting what was said. </p>\n\n<p>Cautions: Follow the rules stated in 1 Corinthians 14. </p>\n\n<p><strong>KNOWLEDGE:</strong> The divine empowerment to accumulate and analyze\ninformation effectively. (1 Corinthians 12:8) </p>\n\n<p>Distinctives: A person with this gift enjoys studying, doing research, and digging for\nnuggets of truth. They like to assess and accumulate information, facts, and data. They\nare great helpers for teachers and Word-oriented programs. \"Word of Knowledge\"\nindicates that they can communicate that truth as well, even if not through a teaching or\nprophetic gift. </p>\n\n<p>Cautions: If you have this gift, watch for a tendency to be reclusive. You will have to\nbalance time alone studying with pursuit of close relationships. </p>\n\n<p><strong>LEADERSHIP:</strong> The spiritual capability to instill vision, to motivate,\nand to direct people to accomplish the work of the ministry. (Romans 12:8) </p>\n\n<p>Distinctives: A person with this gift is a \"goal setter\" in the church. They\noften sense the direction in which God wants to move the body of Christ. They can then\nmotivate people to move in that direction. Gifted leaders think about and communicate the\npotential they see in other people. This gift is needed in any effective ministry. </p>\n\n<p>Cautions: Realize that good relationships give leaders credibility. People need to have\nthe sense that you have their best interest at heart, that you walk with God and that the\nvision you have is not of your own concoction. This gift will be proven over time; there\nneeds to be proven faithfulness here. Leaders need the ability to keep moving in the face\nof put-downs and doubt. Because this is a very visible gift with lots of feedback being\ngiven, you'll have to be keenly aware of your motivations for service. You will be tested\nin this area through success as well as failure. God will want to help you become\nconsistent and diligent in either situation, relying on Him. There may be a strong\ntendency to draw people to you rather than to God. Remember that all have a sphere of\ninfluence and you can take a leadership position without this gift. </p>\n\n<p><strong>MERCY:</strong> The spiritual capability to minister cheerfully and\nappropriately to people who are suffering. (Romans 12:8) </p>\n\n<p>Distinctives: A person with this gift enjoys serving alongside hurting people. They\nhave a strong desire to remove the pain or discomfort in the lives of others while at the\nsame time remaining strong in their own faith. If this gift isn't exhibited in the body,\nwe're missing a key part of the heart of God. </p>\n\n<p>This is different than compassion (a heart for hurting people). Mercy requires coming\nalongside people on a regular basis, feeling that pain and directing it toward godly\naction to alleviate that pain. They often work well alongside a prophet whom God has used\nto expose sin and pain in someone's life. The person with mercy comes next to that person,\nempathizing deeply with the pain, but offering God's solution for healing. </p>\n\n<p>Cautions: If you have this gift, you probably have a strong emotional component to your\nrelational skills. Often though, when your emotional skills are strong, it is less natural\nto offer direction and truth based on God's word. </p>\n\n<p>You may fail to recognize the benefits that difficult times can bring to a person's\nlife. For example, you may overlook how God is using a situation to bring about repentance\nor restitution. If you act too quickly you may short-circuit what God is trying to do. </p>\n\n<p>Be careful you don't become so overwhelmed with others' problems that you don't take\ncare of your own personal obligations. </p>\n\n<p><strong>MIRACLES:</strong> The spiritual capability to obtain exceptional interventions\nof God's power that glorify Him and give evidence of His grace. (1 Corinthians 12: 10, 28)\n</p>\n\n<p>Distinctives: This gift often accompanies the gift of apostleship (2 Corinthians 12)\nand evangelism. Miracles can accompany preaching of the message where there is a question\nabout its truthfulness (Mark 2). They authenticate God's message but do not cause faith. </p>\n\n<p>Cautions: There is a great temptation to direct the amazement of the people towards\nyou, rather than toward God who is doing the work. It's a temptation for us to believe\nthat we would take a step in faith if only we would see a miracle to affirm that God will\nfulfill his promises. This is not authentic faith. </p>\n\n<p><strong>PROPHECY:</strong> The spiritual capability to proclaim God's truth with power\nand clarity in a timely and culturally sensitive fashion for correction, repentance, or\nedification. (Romans 12:6; 1 Corinthians 12:10, 28; Ephesians 4:11) </p>\n\n<p>Distinctives: A person with this gift has an amazing ability to understand biblical\ntruth, to apply it to the events and nuances of culture, and to expose the culture in its\ndeception. They may seem like they aren't really compassionate - \"they just say the\ntruth and let the chips fall where they may.\" When they are effective, others often\nfeel uncomfortable because God convicts them through the person with this gift. They are\ndiscerning, expressive, desire time alone (to get clarity), opinionated, and\nauthoritative. They often see and articulate what many are oblivious to, or see only\ndimly. Those with the gift of prophecy express themselves in many ways: speaking publicly,\nsharing in Home Church, or communicating one-on-one. </p>\n\n<p>Cautions: Beware of lacking compassion. Your commitment to speak the truth may be so\nstrong that you forget to say it with love (Ephesians 4:15, 1 Corinthians 13, Romans\n12:9ff., 1 Peter 4:8). You can discourage people if you're not careful. Nonetheless,\nremember that the purpose of your gift is to console, encourage, exhort\n(1Corinthians14:3), even if others may become uncomfortable. Also beware of pride and\nthinking you're the only one who sees things the way they really are. </p>\n\n<p><strong>SHEPHERDING:</strong> The spiritual capability to guide, care for, and nurture\nindividuals or groups in the body of Christ as they grow in faith. (Ephesians 4:11) </p>\n\n<p>Distinctives: A person with this gift provides oversight. They have a natural tendency\nto nurture people and give them direction. Shepherds are willing to provide the long-term\ncare needed to help others work through issues in their lives. They like to spend time\nwith people, feeding, protecting and disciplining in love. They gravitate towards building\ndiscipleship relationships. Gifted shepherds are a good balance for the gifted\nadministrator or leader. </p>\n\n<p>Cautions: If you have this gift, don't use your oversight and concern to shield people\nfrom real-life experiences. Also, be careful to not view people as projects. Shepherds\noften have a clear vision for someone's growth. Don't impose your concerns and vision on\nsomeone else. Allow room for the Holy Spirit to convict and move them. The process remains\nbetween them and God. Remember that it is God that causes the growth; don't take\nresponsibility for their problems. </p>\n\n<p><strong>TEACHING:</strong> The spiritual capability to understand, clearly explain, and\napply the Word of God to the lives of listeners. (Romans 12:7; 1 Corinthians 12:28;\nEphesians 4:11) </p>\n\n<p>Distinctives: Teachers have a real thirst for knowledge and have an insatiable desire\nto share that knowledge. A person with this gift can develop the ability to understand and\nfashion the message in a learner-oriented manner. They tend to be self-disciplined and\nprefer to teach groups rather than individuals. </p>\n\n<p>Cautions: Teachers often study and learn much more than can actually be conveyed in a\nsingle teaching. The teaching itself must convey the most important truths and be\npractical. You may tend to be too profound or detail-oriented. Make certain that you keep\nthe teaching focused enough for the audience to hear it and digest its application. It is\nalso common for a teacher to struggle with pride because she or he often has more\nknowledge than others do. Be careful not to become upset with people who are not as\nexcited about a truth as you are. Most importantly, make certain that you are as\ninterested in people as you are in facts. </p>\n\n<p>If you find out that this may be where you are gifted, realize that doesn't qualify you\nto present at Central Teaching or even Home Church tomorrow. A teaching gift takes time to\ndevelop. Choose a ministry that you are interested in, get involved, and pray for\nopportunities for your gifting to be used. </p>\n\n<p>Watch out for self-promotion. You may hear yourself think, \"they ought to put me\nup to teach!\" You may feel anger or resentment that you haven't been asked to teach\nyet or teach often enough. </p>\n\n<p><strong>TONGUES:</strong> The spiritual capability to express praise and worship to God\nin an unknown spiritual language. (1 Corinthians 12:10) </p>\n\n<p>Distinctives: This is a spiritual ability to communicate directly between our spirit\nand God in a heavenly language. Unless they are also gifted in interpretation,\ntongue-speakers usually don't know what they are saying. The gift of tongues, according to\n1 Corinthians 14, is primarily for self-edification. </p>\n\n<p>Cautions: If you have the gift of tongues, it might be tempting to believe that your\ngift deserves as much \"air time\" as some of the other gifts. This is not\nreflected in the passage on gifts in 1 Corinthians 12 -14. Gifts like prophecy, which are\nable to edify the rest of the church, are more emphasized in a group setting (2 Cor.\n14:18,19). It is important to remember that not only are there a variety of gifts but also\na variety of ministries in which they are used. </p>\n\n<p><strong>WISDOM:</strong> The spiritual capability to apply spiritual knowledge\neffectively. (1 Corinthians 12:8) </p>\n\n<p>Distinctives: A person with this gift enjoys skillfully applying biblical knowledge to\na variety of life situations. They seem to have more common sense than the average person.\n</p>\n\n<p>Cautions: For God's knowledge to go out, it must first come in. Don't sit on your Bible\nknowledge as though you \"have enough.\" This gift of wisdom has greater impact as\nyour knowledge of God's Word grows and as you become more involved in other people's\nlives.</p>\n\n<p>Copyright &#xA9; Xenos Christian Fellowship, 2000</p>\n&#xA0;\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Spiritul Gift Descriptions","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/principles/spgifts.htm"}

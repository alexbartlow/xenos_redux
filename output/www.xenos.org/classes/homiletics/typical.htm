Avoid taking a long time to get \n          into the text. The introduction should serve to arouse interest in the \n          thesis. You can do this by stating the thesis in an arresting way, stating \n          an antithesis, posing a dilemma, using an example or illustration, or \n          whatever gives a mandate for learning and applying this truth. </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Read the text</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Depending on how long your passage is, decide whether to read the \n          entire text or the first section. </li>\n        <li>Read in a clear and interesting way, emphasizing key words or phrases. \n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Relevant background (if necessary)</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>It is sometimes necessary to supply some historical background information \n          about the text in order to make its meaning more understandable to the \n          audience. Avoid overdoing this. </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>State the thesis</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Declare the main thesis of the text, or the thesis you have chosen \n          from the text. Strive for a concise, interesting statement that defines \n          the thesis. </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Justify the thesis (if necessary)</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>The thesis is usually obvious to your audience. When, however, the \n          thesis isn't readily apparent, you should demonstrate that the text \n          actually <i>does</i> teach this thesis. Otherwise, your audience will \n          be resistant to further persuasion. You can justify the thesis by defining \n          key words in the text, pointing out the context, explaining relevant \n          historical background, or alluding to other parallel passages. </li>\n        <li>Sometimes, you need to justify the thesis, not because it is unclear, \n          but because it is unpopular in our culture (e.g. hell). The original \n          author usually doesn't defend the thesis because his audience was already \n          convinced of it, but you may need to \"back up\" and give an \n          apologetical basis before you can go on in your teaching. Especially \n          when non-Christians are present, effective persuasion cannot occur until \n          you provide a reasonable defense. </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Illustrate the thesis (if necessary)</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Many theses are sufficiently clear and require no illustration. But \n          theses that are abstract or unfamiliar to the audience often benefit \n          from illustrations (e.g., Rom.&#xA0;6:6). Illustrations can also stimulate \n          interest in and bring home the significance of the thesis. Be sure that \n          the illustration is simple and to the point; otherwise, you'll only \n          make the thesis more confusing! </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Supply the antithesis</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Popularly expressed antitheses help to further define the thesis and \n          bring out its significance to life. They also often suggest certain \n          obvious applications. </li>\n        <li>It is sometimes more effective to introduce the antithesis <i>before</i> \n          contrasting it to the thesis. </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Make the application</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>This is the most important part of biblical preaching: to convince \n          the audience of the need to <i>act</i> on the truth they've just learned \n          and been convinced of. Application should be clear and practical. </li>\n        <li>You should find a way to communicate that you also need this application \n          (and do not always follow it!). </li>\n        <li>In some cases (like problem passages), the explanation of the text \n          <i>is</i> the application since it resolves the audience's problem with \n          the text (i.e. Rom. 9; 1&#xA0;Tim.&#xA0;2:12-15). </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Many times the application <i>is</i> the conclusion. At other times,\n          it's helpful to summarize the main points of the sermon. Avoid trailing\n          off.&#xA0;      </li>\n      </ul>\n       </div>\n      \n\n\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Homiletics Workshop - Typical Teaching Format","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/homiletics/typical.htm"}

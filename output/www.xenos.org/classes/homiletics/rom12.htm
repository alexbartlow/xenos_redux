This means <i>learning</i>\nabout every key area of life from the perspective of God's Word, and then <i>choosing to\nact </i>consistently with this new perspective.</p>\n\n<p>EXAMPLE: Most of us thought knowing God was either a matter of earning his acceptance\nthrough good works, or realizing we were already God or one with God. But when we <i>learn</i>\nfrom God's Word that we are alienated from God because of our sins and that Christ's death\npaid the full price for our sins, and <i>choose to act </i>on that truth, God reconciles\nus to himself once for all.</p>\n\n<p>But this is only the beginning. In the following verses, Paul unpacks some other areas\nwe need mental renewal if we want spiritual transformation. Look at what he puts first on\nhis list . . . </p>\n\n<h3>How we think about ourselves in relation to other Christians</h3>\n\n<p>Read vs 3a. Literally, Paul says we should think about ourselves \"sanely\"\n(\"sound judgment\" - see Mark 5:15) rather than as \"megalomaniacs.\" </p>\n\n<p>What does it mean to think about ourselves with \"sound judgment?\" Read vs\n3b--to think about ourselves \"as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.\"\nWhat is this \"measure of faith?\" The cardinal rule of interpretation is <i>context</i>,\nso let's read on . . . </p>\n\n<p>Read vs 4-6. \"Measure\" or \"proportion\" of faith refers to the roles\nwe play in \"the body of Christ.\" In other words, those who have received Christ\nneed to begin to view themselves as members of Christ's body. <i>Paul is saying we need to\nundergo a fundamental change in the way we think about ourselves in relation to other\nChristians.</i> We need to start seeing ourselves as connected to Jesus Christ and to\nother Christians in the same way that our physical organs are connected to the whole body\nand to other organs.</p>\n\n<h3>\"I have no need of you\"</h3>\n\n<p>What if your kidney suddenly became a conscious, thinking, choosing entity? And what if\nit said to you tomorrow morning: \"Hey, I'm tired of being connected to all these\nother organs. The idea that I need them is offensive to my self-worth. I want to be free\nto be me!! From now on, I'm on my own! I'll get together with the rest of these organs\nonce a week, but that's it.\" Let me ask you a couple of questions:</p>\n\n<p>How is your kidney thinking about itself--with \"sound judgment\" or \"more\nhighly than it ought to think?\" It is speaking like a megalomaniac! Why? Because it <i>is</i>\nan organ of your body, no matter what it may think about itself. And as an organ, it needs\nthe support of the other organs.</p>\n\n<p>What's going to happen if your kidney begins to act according to this megalomaniacal\nthinking? It's going to be in real trouble very quickly--and the rest of your body would\nsuffer also . . . </p>\n\n<p>Now I have another question. What is the difference between your kidney saying the\nabove, and you as a Christian saying: \"Hey, I have received Christ, I have the Holy\nSpirit indwelling me. I don't need involvement with other Christians.\"</p>\n\n<p>You see, what we instantly understand and affirm about our own physical bodies, we\noften neither understand nor affirm about our relationship with Christ and other\nChristians. This is why Paul says 1 Cor. 12:21 (read). This runs directly counter to\nAMERICAN AUTONOMOUS INDIVIDUALISM . . . </p>\n\n<p>Yes, we each have our own individual relationships with Christ, and we experience much\nof his life and truth and love directly from him in that relationship. But much of what\nChrist wants to give to us in these same areas he has chosen to make available <i>only\nthrough other Christians</i>. Therefore, it is impossible to mature past a relatively\nprimitive point unless we are willing to get involved consistently and in-depth with other\nChristians. \n\n</p><ul>\n  <li>This is why the early Christians would have been aghast at the American idea of\n    \"going to church.\" We don't go to church--we are the church!!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>This is why they \"continuously devoted themselves\" to fellowship.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>This is why they met not only in large groups, but also in homes--to facilitate this\n    kind of involvement. That's why we have this meeting, and study groups, and ministry\n    houses, etc. This meeting is only the APPETIZER--not the MAIN COURSE!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>This is why so much New Testament emphasis is placed on how to develop and maintain\n    personal, Christ-centered love relationships with other Christians </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you want to really take off spiritually, you need to get involved with other\nChristians in this way! For some of you, this is the thing holding you back. I know it was\nfor me (1970-1971). God is not going to capitulate to your autonomy--he's going to hold\nback and call on you to \"think sanely\" and take your place as a member of his\nBody!</p>\n\n<h3>\"I have nothing to contribute\"</h3>\n\n<p>So far, we've only talked about the <i>receiving</i> side of Body-life. But there is\nalso a <i>contributing</i> side as well . . . </p>\n\n<p>Go back to your talking kidney. It has changed its mind about not needing the other\norgans, but its thinking is still problematic: \"I'm only a kidney, so I have nothing\nsignificant to contribute to this body. Now if I was a brain/heart/hand, that would be\ndifferent. But since I am a mere kidney and since I don't feel important, it doesn't\nreally matter whether I function or not.\"</p>\n\n<p>How would you counsel your kidney? You'd say, \"Look here--you're thinking insanely\nagain. It doesn't matter how you feel about this. You are in fact a kidney, you do in fact\nhave a significant contribution to make. This body will be impacted by whether you\ncontribute or not. So start affirming your significance and play your part!\"</p>\n\n<p>This is megalomania too, isn't it? Your kidney would have to think quite a lot of\nitself to decide it was the only organ in your body that had nothing to contribute.</p>\n\n<p>Again, how easily we recognize this about our own physical bodies--while rejecting it\nabout our involvement in the church! Yet Paul insists in this same passage that just as we\nneed the contribution of the other members, so we need to make our own contribution. Read\nvs 6-8. We <i>all</i> have unique spiritual gifts which enable us to make unique spiritual\ncontributions to one another. \n\n</p><ul>\n  <li>This why \"fellowship\" isn't a hall in back of the sanctuary--it means\n    \"sharing\" the life of Christ with one another.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>This is why \"ministry\" is not something only a few professionals do in highly\n    visible ways--but rather something that each and every one of us is supposed to be\n    involved in as a lifestyle (often in non-visible ways--see most of the gifts mentioned in\n    vs 6-8).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>This is why we discover what our spiritual gifts are primarily by consistently\n    practicing biblical love in the context of Christian fellowship--not waiting until we know\n    how we're gifted before we get involved.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Just as we make a critical step when we choose to regularly <i>receive</i> from other\nChristians, we also make a critical step when we choose to regularly <i>give</i> to other\nChristians. </p>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>What other factors hinder involvement in Body-life? \n    \n</li>\n  <li>\"Not enough time\"</li>\n  <li>Moral problems (fear of exposure)</li>\n  <li>Tribalism</li>\n  <li>Bad experience with family, authority, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n </div>\n      \n\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Homiletics Workshop - Romans 12:3-8","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/homiletics/rom12.htm"}

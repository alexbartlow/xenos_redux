While there may be many valid <i>applications</i> for a text, there is only one\nvalid <i>interpretation</i>. The task of the interpreter is to ascertain the intended\nmeaning, if possible, using the following tools. </p>\n\n<h3>Interpreting Grammatically</h3>\n\n<p>The historical-critical method assumes that words and expressions have a relatively\n      stable meaning during given periods of history. Therefore, we begin by taking what we can\n      determine as the normal, everyday meaning of the words, phrases, and sentences to the\n      extent possible. In other words, our interpretation must correspond to the words and\n      grammar in the text in a reasonable way. Otherwise, the interpreter could assign meaning\n      of his own without objective control. The Bible would become a horoscope of vague sayings\n      we try to plug into our lives however we're able. \n    \n</p>\n<ol>\n      <li>Most of the Bible can be easily interpreted by simply taking the language (either in the\n        original or in the translation) in the usual way (John 3:36; Acts 1:11). In other words,\n        \"if the plain sense makes sense, seek no other sense.\" </li>\n      <li>A plain sense reading should not be confused with a literalistic interpretation. We\n        should allow for figures of speech (Mark 1:5; Luke 22:19). </li>\n      <li>If a passage contains symbols or a special literary genre, this should be indicated in\n        the text, either by textual cues, or because symbolism is required in order to make sense\n        of the text. Most symbols are explained by the Bible itself (Revelation 1:9-20). </li>\n    </ol>\n\n<h3>Interpreting Historically</h3>\n\n<p>Historical interpretation means that we take into account, as much as possible, the\n      historical background of the author and the recipients. The Bible was written to ordinary\n      people, and is understandable to anyone. However, it was written thousands of years ago to\n      different cultures. Therefore, as modern readers, we have to try to recover a general\n      sense of the meaning of words, phrases and concepts in the ancient cultures addressed in\n      Scripture, primarily, Hebrew culture and Greco-Roman culture of the first century. </p>\n<p>We are not interested, at first, in the question, \"What does it mean to me?\"\n          but rather, \"What did it mean to those to whom it was originally\n                written?\" </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Genesis 15:7-21 -- \"Cutting a covenant\" solemnized\n                        a contract between two parties. It was normally bilateral\n                        (both parties walked through), but in this case only\n                      God goes through. </li>\n  <li>Revelation 2:12,13 -- Pergamum was the center of the worship\n                            of Aesclepius. </li>\n  <li>1 Corinthians 11:4-6 -- Shorn hair was typical of Aphrodite\n                            priestess-prostitutes; shaven heads were typical\n    of convicted adulteresses (v. 5). </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Use Bible dictionaries or other sources to discover customs, money, geography, etc. Then\n              find a corresponding meaning in our culture. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Good Samaritan (Luke 10); 2 Denarii (Mark 6:37); 50,000 Drachma\n                    (Acts 19:19). </li>\n  <li>Pharisees' teaching on the relationship between illness and sin\n                    (Mark 2; John 9:1). </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Interpreting Critically</h3>\n\n<p>Your interpretation must make rational sense. If interpretation is permitted to\n      contradict, there is no reason for hermeneutics, since we may make a passage say whatever\n      we want. </p>\n<h4><b>Six Practical Rules:</b> </h4>\n<p>These rules will enable you to arrive at a critically sound\ninterpretation. Some of these rules are the outgrowth of a high view of scripture. In\nother words, the entire Bible is the product of one author (God) at the same time that it\nis the product of many authors (Prophets and Apostles). Therefore, it is not unreasonable\nto seek to find a consistent message throughout the Bible. \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li><strong>Interpret in light of the context of the passage.</strong> Follow\n          the thought development in the book you are reading, and make sure your interpretation\n          flows along\n          with the general direction of argument. Sudden changes in subject are unusual.\n          If you have the\n          thought development of a book centering on one subject, suddenly switching\n          to another, and then back to the first, then your interpretation is almost\n          certainly wrong.<br>\n          <br>\n          Consider the larger context as well: Which Testament? Which\n                author? What time period? Never view a passage in isolation from\n        its surroundings. The\n                  context should be considered the most important kind of evidence\n              for the interpretation of a passage. Usually context supplies all\n        we need to\n              know\n                  in order to interpret a passage. We should turn to other explanations\n              only when we can find no critically feasible interpretation based\n        on the English\n                  text in its context. <ul>\n  <li>Matthew 16:28 -- Referring to the transfiguration (in context of passage). </li>\n  <li>1 Corinthians 14:34 -- Means to disrupt (see 1 Corinthians 11:5 and the\n              context of the book and passage). </li>\n  <li>1 Corinthians 3:17 -- Thought development of the passage limits interpretation. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n  <li><strong>Interpret in light of progressive revelation</strong> (Hebrews\n              1:1,2). While God's purpose for man has never changed, His strategy\n          in accomplishing that purpose has changed. He has\n            dealt with man under different \"covenants,\" or programs. Therefore, it is\n            important to ask, \"Under which program was this written?\" Primary\n            application of the passage will be to the people operating under\n            the program, and not necessarily to\n            others. There may be secondary applications for people in other programs\n            based on principles which have universal application. (Note the special\n            problems here in connection\n            with the ministry of Christ before the cross.)\n<ul>\n  <li>Polygamy was permitted (never condoned) in the Old Testament,\n                but taught against in the New Testament (1 Timothy 3:2). </li>\n  <li>Theocracy was commanded in the Old Testament, but secular government\n                                    is affirmed in the New Testament (Romans\n    13:1-7; Matthew 22:21; 2 Chronicles 7:14). </li>\n  <li>Animal sacrifices, dietary laws, Sabbaths, holy days, religious\n                    festivals, priests and liturgy have all been fulfilled in\n    Christ and are thus obsolete\n                                    (Colossians 2:16,17;\n                          Hebrews 8). </li>\n  <li>Malachi 3:7-12 -- In context of the testament (see Numbers 18:21-24;\n                          Deuteronomy 14:22-29). </li>\n</ul>\n</li><li><strong>Interpret scripture in harmony with other scripture</strong>.\n    Since the Bible is inspired by God, it does not contradict itself. Therefore,\n    never interpret\n    scripture in such a way\n    that your interpretation clearly contradicts other scriptures. First discover\n    the allowable range of meaning for a passage, then choose the interpretation\n    that doesn't\n    contradict other scriptures.\n    <ul>\n      <li>Acts 2:38 could either be referring to baptismal regeneration, or simply\n        adding baptism as a desirable adjunct to the minimum requirement for\n        salvation (i.e. faith). In view of\n            the clear teaching on salvation by grace through faith alone, the\n        latter interpretation is preferable. </li>\n      <li>James 2:14-26 -- \"Justify\" can also mean \"justify before\n        men.\" </li>\n      <li>1 John 1:9 could refer to Christians getting God's (legal) forgiveness\n        only as they continue to confess their sins. Since this contradicts the\n        clear teaching on justification\n            and eternal security, it is preferable to interpret this passage\n        as either referring to non-Christians or perhaps to experiential forgiveness\n        for Christians. </li>\n    </ul>\n</li>\n  <li><strong>Interpret the unclear in light of the clear</strong>. Scripture\n    teaches every major, essential truth clearly and repeatedly. Never build\n    a doctrine on an unclear passage.\n    <ul>\n      <li>Luke 16:9 is used by Roman Catholics to support indulgences. </li>\n      <li>1 Corinthians 15:29 mentions an obscure, unknown practice used in Corinth.\n        Today the Mormons use this passage to elevate dead ancestors to a higher\n        status in the afterlife. </li>\n      <li>1 John 5:16 -- The \"sin unto death\" is never defined. You can't build a\n            doctrine of \"falling away\" on such a passage. </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Interpret the \"spirit\" of the passage, not necessarily the\n    \"letter,\" or the literalistic meaning, especially when the text\n    is a literary genre prone to figures of speech or colorful statements</strong>.\n    <ul>\n      <li>Proverbs 22:6 -- The book of Proverbs contains many general maxims,\n        but not all are absolute promises. Not every child will go right, but\n        most will. </li>\n      <li>Proverbs 15:1 -- Not every gentle word will turn away wrath, but in\n        most cases it will. </li>\n      <li>1 Corinthians 11:1-18 -- In some New Testament passages, interpretation\n        by the \"letter\" contradicts the \"spirit\" of the passage\n        (c.f. 1 Corinthians 10:32,33). </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Interpret with dependence upon the Holy Spirit, allowing Him to teach you</strong>. Mark T\n    or F for each of the following: \n    <ul>\n      <li>Proverbs 3:5 -- \"Lean not unto your own understanding\" means\n        we should avoid approaching the Bible on a primarily analytical level. </li>\n      <li>Since the Bible is \"living and active,\" the interpretation\n        of a passage may be different for different people. </li>\n      <li>Unless we approach God's word with a deep reverence for God and a passion\n        to know His will for our lives, we may often get the wrong interpretation. </li>\n      <li>If the rules of interpretation give one answer and the Holy Spirit\n        shows another, we should choose the latter interpretation. </li>\n      <li>We should pray, before studying, that God will enable us to understand\n        the passage. </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  </ol>\n </div>\n      \n\n\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Homiletics Workshop - Grammatical-Historical Hermeneutics","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/homiletics/gramherm.htm"}

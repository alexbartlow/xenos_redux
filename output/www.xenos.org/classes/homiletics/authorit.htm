See Stott's 2 CLIFFS: Biblical passages were written to a specific setting\n    which is separated from our world by an imposing chasm of language, culture, time, etc.\n    Typically, the church has made one of two errors in this crucial task: </p><blockquote>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p>Some tend to focus only on the task of understanding and explaining the biblical text.\n        This is the typical error of theological conservatives, and it results in the sense that\n        the Bible is irrelevant to our world (or trying to create a ghetto that mimics the\n        biblical world).</p>\n        <p>Others tend to focus on cultural relevance, but then reject or remake the biblical\n        message to conform to contemporary perspectives. This is the typical error of theological\n        liberalism, and it results in silencing the Bible's authority.</p>\n        <p>God wants preachers--Christian communicators who are students of both worlds, who stand\n        \"between two worlds\" and demonstrate that God's Word is intelligible, relevant,\n        and impactful to our world (prophetic).</p>\n      </blockquote>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Explain syllabus. </p><blockquote>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p>NOTE: Your teachings should attempt to squeeze a home group teaching into 10 minutes\n        (just as home group teachings should not attempt to squeeze a Central Teaching into 30\n        minutes).

Here we are beginning to build the bridge between the biblical\n        and contemporary worlds.

Know\n    your tendency and check each teaching for your weakness. (MORE NEXT WEEK ON DELIVERY)</b></p>\n    <p>The burden for the teaching comes primarily from the \"thesis/antithesis\"\n    section of the work sheet. The commonly or popularly expressed antitheses provide the\n    \"fortresses\" in your audience's thinking that can be \"destroyed\" by\n    the scriptural theses (see 2&#xA0;Cor.&#xA0;10:4,5; 6:7). <i>This is why</i> t<i>eachings\n    without antitheses are usually boring.</i> </p><blockquote>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p><b>J.

When did I first learn this truth? How did\n        I first apply it? How did my life suffer because I was ignorant of it? How have I\n        re-learned and re-applied it since? What has happened when I have chosen to respond to\n        this truth? What has happened when I have refused to follow it?\" Often, you will need\n        to come under fresh conviction of the truth before you can become burdened to preach it. </p><blockquote>\n          <p><b>\"Get <i>into</i> the Word, get <i>under</i> the Word&#x97;then <i>go forth</i>\n          with the Word!\"</b></p>\n          <p><b>You may use some of this in your teaching&#x97;but not necessarily.</b></p>\n        </blockquote>\n        <p>Next, prayerfully ask the same kinds of questions of <i>specific people likely</i> to\n        be in your audience. Ask God for a vision of what could happen to them if they learn and\n        follow this truth--and what will happen if they don&#x92;t.</p>\n        <p>Next, prayerfully think about how <i>people in our culture</i> have been damaged and\n        deceived by the antitheses.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>STEP #5: \"Goal\" </b>\n\n</p><blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Your selection of theses and burden for those theses should yield a clear goal for your\n    teaching.

If you must have a longer introduction, don't tell people what text\n        you're in until the end of it.</b></p>\n      </blockquote>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>STEP #9: \"Conclusion\" </b>\n\n</p><blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>The conclusion will often call for a response from your audience. It may also summarize\n    the content of the outline. <b>Home group teachers should be ready with related questions\n    to redirect the group into discussion.</b> Avoid trailing off without a definite end.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Examples of Completed <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/homiletics/rom12wk.htm\">Homiletical Worksheets</a></b></p>\n\n<p><b>Tips on Teaching Narrative (if time) </b>\n\n</p><blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>You may need to supply more historical background to make it come alive.</p>\n    <p>Avoid \"moralizing\" the text--stopping constantly to make little application\n    points. This \"string of pearls\" teaching style obscures the main point(s) of the\n    narrative. Instead, determine the main point(s) of the narrative section and build your\n    outline around it/them.</p>\n    <p>Identify the \"tension\" in the narrative--the conflict between two parties,\n    the discrepancy between promise and fulfillment, etc. Tell the story in a way that\n    highlights this \"tension.\" This unleashes the inherent power of narrative and\n    will draw people in. </p><blockquote>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p><b>Abraham &amp; God; Jacob &amp; Esau; Joseph &amp; brothers</b></p>\n      </blockquote>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>In long narrative sections (e.g., Joseph), condense the story and tell it in an\n    interesting way without reading most of the text. Read only key portions of the text. Then\n    distill your theology and/or application afterwards.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n </div>\n      \n\n\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Homiletics - Authoritative Speaking","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/homiletics/authorit.htm"}

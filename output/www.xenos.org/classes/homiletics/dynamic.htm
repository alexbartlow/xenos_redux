LEARNER-ORIENTED</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>It is your responsibility to cause the audience to learn--not theirs. You must be\n    willing to do whatever it takes to accomplish this. </li>\n  <li>Be a servant of your audience. Focus on meeting their needs to grow, not on your need to\n    be admired as a teacher. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>2. EXPECTATION-ORIENTED</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Your opinion of and your belief in your audience (whether stated or not) will radically\n    affect their response. </li>\n  <li>Believe in your audience and express that belief. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>3. APPLICATION-ORIENTED</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Explanation without application is truncation of truth. Explanation should be seen as\n    the proper means to application. </li>\n  <li>What is your audience going to leave the room convinced of, motivated, and determined to\n    do? </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>4. RETENTION-ORIENTED</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Distill your material to a form that can be easily remembered. </li>\n  <li>Make use of simple charts, illustrations and key words. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>5. NEED-ORIENTED</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>No matter how well presented your teaching was, if it didn't meet your audience's needs,\n    it was a failure. </li>\n  <li>Your content does not have a \"need to be taught.\" Rather, your audience has\n    needs to be met. Your job is not to impress your audience with how much you know. It's to\n    discover what their needs are and gear your material to meet them. On the other hand, one\n    need shared by all is the need to understand biblical theology and worldview. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>6. EQUIPPING-ORIENTED</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The final test of your teaching is not what takes place <i>during</i> the meeting--it's\n    what takes place <i>after</i> the meeting. </li>\n  <li>Your teaching should bear observable fruit in the their lives and in the lives of the\n    people with whom they are working. </li>\n</ul>\n </div>\n      \n\n\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Homiletics - Six Laws of Dynamic Bible Teaching","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/homiletics/dynamic.htm"}

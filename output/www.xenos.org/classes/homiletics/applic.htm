The following\napplication restrictions should prevent \"steer-wrestling.\" Steer-wrestling\noccurs when we don't let the passage communicate what it wants to, but instead wrestle it\ninto our intended meaning. </p>\n\n<p>1. Any application used must not necessitate a change in interpretation. In other\nwords, application must depend upon interpretation, not vice versa. The following are\nexamples of steer-wrestling: \n\n</p><ul>\n  <li>Romans 14 and 1 Corinthians 8 applied to \"stumbling\" a non-Christian. </li>\n  <li>2 Corinthians 9:6-11; Galatians 6:6-10; and Colossians 3:25 applied to sinning in\n    general. </li>\n  <li>1 Corinthians 3:16,17 used to support damnation for those who commit suicide. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>2. If an application is adduced which is different from, or broader than, the\napplication the author actually intended in that context, evidence must be given which\nshows that the new application is justified. Acceptable evidence would be: a) common\nsense--a reasonable link to the new application, or b) language indicating variable\napplication. Which of the following applications are valid? \n\n</p><ul>\n  <li>1 Corinthians 6:19 arguing against smoking cigarettes; </li>\n  <li>2 Corinthians 13:5 commanding introspection and 1 Corinthians 4:3 forbidding reflection;\n  </li>\n  <li>1 Timothy 3:6 applying to a home group leader or worker; </li>\n  <li>Colossians 3:22-4:1 applying to employer/employee relationships; </li>\n  <li>1 Corinthians 7:24 applying to moving out of town; </li>\n  <li>Hebrews 10:26 applying to any willful sin; or </li>\n  <li>2 Chronicles 7:14 applying to 20th Century USA. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>3. Narrative example cannot be imposed authoritatively unless backed up by precept or\nprinciple. Study the following examples. Which ones are legitimate uses of narrative? \n\n</p><ul>\n  <li>Plurality of leadership is required in the church (Acts 14:23); </li>\n  <li>We, too, must observe the Lord's day (Acts 20:7); </li>\n  <li>Tongues are required as the sign of the baptism of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2; 8; 10; 19); </li>\n  <li>People should \"tarry\" for the Spirit, awaiting the second blessing (Acts\n    1:4,13,14); </li>\n  <li>Communal living is normative for the church (Acts 4:32); or </li>\n  <li>The Crusades were okay because of the example of the conquest of Canaan (Joshua). </li>\n</ul>\n\n </div>\n      \n\n\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Homiletics - Application Restrictions","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/homiletics/applic.htm"}

W. Stott, <i>Between Two Worlds</i> (Grand\nRapids: Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1982), pp. 211-216. </p>\n\n<h2><i>I. Choose your text</i></h2>\n\n<p><b>A</b>.It is best to rely on expository book studies for the steady diet of your\npeople, because this ensures they will get \"the whole counsel of God.\" </p>\n\n<p><b>B</b>. However, the following may be occasions for special sermons: \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li>Special calendar occasions: Christmas, Easter, etc. </li>\n  <li>Special external circumstances which are in the public mind. </li>\n  <li>Special needs discerned by the preacher or others. </li>\n  <li>Truths which have specially inspired the preacher. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><b>C</b>. Keep a notebook to scribble down ideas for sermons, insights, burdens,\nillustrations, etc. Record them immediately wherever they come to mind, because you will\nusually forget them later. </p>\n\n<h2><i>II. Meditate on the text</i></h2>\n\n<p><b>A</b>. Whenever possible, plan out texts weeks or months in advance. This gives the\nbenefit of \"subconscious incubation\". </p>\n\n<p><b>B</b>. Concentrated \"incubation\" should begin at least one week before\npreaching. It should involve the following: \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li>Read, re-read, and re-re-read the text. </li>\n  <li>Be sure you understand what it means. Do your own interpretive work. Don't use\n    commentaries until you have formulated specific interpretive questions which you have been\n    unable to answer, or until you have completed your interpretive work. </li>\n  <li>Brood longer over how it applies to your people, to the culture, to you, etc. </li>\n  <li>Pray for God to illuminate the text, especially its application. </li>\n  <li>Scribble down notes of thoughts, ideas, etc. </li>\n  <li>Solicit the insights of others through tapes, talking with other preachers, etc. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2><i>III. Isolate the dominant thought </i></h2>\n\n<p><i>(This is the purpose of section II.)</i> </p>\n\n<p><b>A. </b>Your sermon should convey only one major message. All of the details of your\nsermon should be marshaled to help your people grasp that message and feel its power. </p>\n\n<p><b>B.</b> You should be able to express the dominant thought in one short, clear, vivid\nsentence. </p>\n\n<h2><i>IV. Arrange your material to serve the dominant thought</i> </h2>\n\n<p><b>A.</b> Chisel and shape your material. Ruthlessly discard all material which is\nirrelevant to the dominant thought. Subordinate the remaining material to the dominant\nthought by using that material to <i>illuminate</i> and <i>reinforce</i> the dominant\nthought. </p>\n\n<p><b>B.</b> Your sermon structure should be suited to the text, not artificially imposed.\nAvoid structure which is too clever, prominent or complex. </p>\n\n<p><b>C.</b> Decide on your method of preaching for this text: argumentation, faceting,\ncategorizing, analogy, etc. </p>\n\n<p><b>D.</b> Carefully choose words that are precise, simple, clear, vivid and honest.\nWrite out the key sections, phrases, and sentences to help you in your word choice. Stick\nto short declarative and interrogative sentences with few, if any, subordinate clauses. </p>\n\n<p><b>E.</b> Come up with illustrations and examples which will explain and convict.\nEmploy a wide variety: figures of speech, images, retelling biblical stories in\ncontemporary language, inventing fresh parables, retelling true historical and/or\nbiographical events, etc. Keep a file of these, especially if they do not come easily to\nyou. Avoid making illustrations and examples so prominent that they detract from the\ndominant thought. Also, avoid applying them inappropriately or overusing them.<br>\n</p>\n\n<h2><i>V. Add the introduction and conclusion</i></h2>\n\n<p><b>A.</b> The introduction should not be elaborate, but enough to arouse their\ncuriosity, wet their appetites and introduce the dominant thought. This can be done by a\nvariety of means: explaining the setting of the passage, story, current event or issue,\netc. </p>\n\n<p><b>B.</b> The conclusion should not merely recapitulate your sermon--it should apply\nit. Obviously, you should be applying all along, but you should keep something for the end\nwhich will prevail upon your people to take action. \"No summons, no sermon.\"\nPreach though the head to the heart (i.e. the will). The goal of the sermon should be to\n\"storm the citadel of the will and capture it for Jesus Christ.\" What do you\nwant them to <i>do</i>? Employ a variety of methods to do this: \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li><i>Argument</i>: anticipate objections and refute them </li>\n  <li><i>Admonition</i>: warn of the consequences of disobedience </li>\n  <li><i>Indirect Conviction</i>: arouse moral indignation and then turn it on them (Nathan\n    with David) </li>\n  <li><i>Pleading</i>: apply the gentle pressure of God's love, concern for their well-being,\n    and the needs of others </li>\n  <li><i>Vision</i>: paint a picture of what is possible through obedience to God in this area\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2><i>VI. Write down and pray over your message</i></h2>\n\n<p><b>A. </b>Writing out your sermon forces you to think straight and sufficiently. It\nexposes lazy thinking and cures it. After you are thoroughly familiar with your outline,\nreduce it to small notes. </p>\n\n<p><b>B. </b>Pray the God will enable you to \"so possess the message that the message\npossesses you.\"</p>\n </div>\n      \n\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Homiletics Workshop - John Stott on Preparing Sermons","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/homiletics/stotthom.htm"}

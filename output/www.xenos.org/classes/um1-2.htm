Although there is no reason to\nthink we are limited to the forms of polity used in the New Testament era, it is\ninstructive to see how they ran their churches as a beginning point. </big></p>\n\n<h3><big>How were New Testament churches led?</big></h3>\n\n<p><big>There were two offices evident in the New Testament church: elders and deacons. </big></p>\n\n<h4><big>Elders</big></h4>\n\n<p><big><b>Elders vs. Bishops: </b>The office of elder is synonymous with the office of\nbishop. (See Acts 20:17,28 and Titus 1:5,7 where the two terms are used interchangeably).\n\"Elder\" comes from the word <i>presbeuteros </i>which means an older man, and\ntherefore describes a person who is relatively mature spiritually. \"Bishop\"\ncomes from the word <i>episkopos</i> which literally means an <i>overseer</i>. Therefore,\nthis term describes what the person does (i.e. oversees the local church). <br>\n</big></p>\n\n<p><big>The New Testament church appears to have consistently established a <b>plurality\nof eldership </b>in each local church. </big>\n\n</p><ul>\n  <li><big>Acts 14:23 - \". . . appointed elders (plural) in every church (singular). . .\n    \" </big></li>\n  <li><big>Titus 1:5 - \". . . appoint elders (plural) in every city (singular). . .\n    \" </big></li>\n  <li><big>1 Pet. 5:2 - \". . . shepherd the flock (singular) of God among you (plural). .\n    . \" </big></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4><big>The qualifications for elders </big></h4>\n\n<p><big>These generally fall into two categories: </big></p>\n\n<h5><big>1. He must be functionally effective in spiritual leadership. </big></h5>\n\n<p><big>Just as Jesus said sheep would know the voice of their shepherd, (see John 10:4),\nit seems likely that those considered for eldership in the early church had already\ndemonstrated the ability to lead. This is probably why Paul waited for a while after\nstarting the churches in Ephesus and Crete before he had Timothy (ch.3) and Titus (ch. 1)\nappoint elders. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>It took time for the true leaders to naturally emerge. <br>\n</big></p>\n\n<p><big>The ability to lead others in spiritual matters is also implied by the fact that\nthe elder must be \"skilled at teaching\" (1 Tim. 3:2), or, \"able to exhort\nin sound doctrine and refute those who contradict\" (Titus 1:9). A teacher is not\nskillful unless his students learn. Learning includes how to do God's will, not just how\nto know it. (James 1:22-25) Finally, elders and deacons had to \"hold fast the mystery\nof the faith with a clear conscience\" (1 Tim. 3:9) which would not be possible if\nthey were guilty of sins of omission (see also \"above reproach\" 1 Tim. 3:2). <br>\n</big></p>\n\n<p><big>All of these references imply that elders had to be practitioners of the Word, not\njust theoreticians. </big></p>\n\n<h5><big>2.

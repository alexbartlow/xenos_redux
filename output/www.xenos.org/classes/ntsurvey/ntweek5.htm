An illustration from music may be helpful here. Biblical history is like a\n    symphony. It begins with a theme. That theme is expanded and developed through a series of\n    movements, culmitating in the final movement, in which all of the sub-themes are brought\n    together into a final, climactic resolution. By contrast, nonbiblical history may be\n    compared to a jazz piece, in which the tones are more or less disassociated, even random.\n    There is no \"direction\" to the movement, it merely coveys impressions.\n    Nonbiblical history isn't \"going anywhere.\" </p>\n    <p>The biblical view of history ties directly into the way in which we look at our lives.\n    Because history is going some place meaningful, our lives, inasmuch as they are connected\n    in a vital way to this dirction take on objective meaning. Yet, ours is a day in which the\n    notion of purposeful history is fading. Where is history going? What purpose does my life\n    serve in relation to the bigger picture of humanity? The turn in our culture toward a\n    subjective, or individualisitc meaning is the direct result of the absence of a biblical\n    view of history. The consequence of this is depair, nihilism. </p>\n    <p>The Bible's linear view of history includes ultimate accountability for our lives\n    before a perfect moral Being. Because we will be held responsible for our lives, what we\n    do in this world bears ultimate significance (Luke 16:19-31, parable of the rich man and\n    Lazarus). There will be a day of judgement for how we have lived our lives, and whether we\n    have received God's provision for our sin. Again, we find no such parallel in non-biblical\n    religion.</p>\n    <p>2. Kingdom of God.</p>\n    <p>The culmination of biblical history, a time of God's just rule, an era of\n    \"shalom,\" or peace. The biblical portrayal of God is not that he is transcendent\n    only, but also iminant. He is involved in the process of history, and will personally\n    oversee the affairs of human society. Cyclical views of history attribute to impersonal\n    \"fate\" the affairs of life. Biblically, it is the sovereign plan of a\n    redemptive, personal God. The rule of God is a \"mystery.\" It begins with the\n    rule of God in the lives of men and women who voluntarily place themselves under his\n    Lordship. At the end of the age, Christ will return, and his rule will be political and\n    coersive (\"every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall give praise to God.\"\n    Romans 14:11).</p>\n    <p>God's plan for the Kingdom is developed through a series of promises made to the\n    Hebrews. First to Abraham, then to Judah, then David. It would be the Davidic King who\n    would rule over the nations forever. This is at the heart of the messianic hope of the Old\n    Testament scripture. It is the reason why the Gospel writers were so concerned with\n    linking Jesus with the family and city of David, to show that he was the rightful heir to\n    the promise.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Survey of the New Testament: Major Themes in the New Testament","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/ntsurvey/ntweek5.htm"}

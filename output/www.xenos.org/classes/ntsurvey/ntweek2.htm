That is what God intended for the Law in Ex.\n    19:5,6. Israel was to be a living testimony to God for the world. The notion of being a\n    witness to the gentile world was completely lost in 1st century Judaism.

It is not unlike a fable in that sense. Each of the details of the\nparable are typically unimportant. In interpretation, we look for the main idea being\nconveyed. Interpreters since Augustine have gotten into trouble ascribing meaning to each\naspect of the parable. Recent scholarship has shown that the parable form was to express a\nsingle meaning. There are exceptions to the \"one story, one meaning\" principle.\nBut in interpretation, unless the text supplies more that one dimension of interpretation,\nwe must be very tentative in our ascribing more than one meaning.</p>\n\n<p><em>Why did Jesus speak in parables?</em></p>\n\n<p>Mt. 13:10-17. The hardness of heart of the Jewish religious establishment is contrasted\nwith the simple understand of the believer. The simplicity of God confounds the genius of\nfallen man.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <i></i><p>1. Kingdom as a mystery: Much of Jesus' teaching recorded in the Gospels\n  surrounds the identification of himself as the messianic servant of God, and the\n  pronouncement that the reign of God (the kingdom) has come through his ministry. Yet, the\n  reign of God is not as the first century Jews had expected. The true nature of the kingdom\n  Jesus announced was \"not of this world\" (John 18:36) and was shrouded in mystery\n  (Mk. 4:11; Jn. 16:25). </p>\n  <p>\"Mystery\" means something that was hidden, but which is now revealed. The\n  mystery of God's rule is twofold. First that it comes to the \"unlikely.\" That is\n  the message of the Sermon on the Mount. God offers his kingdom not to those who think they\n  satisfy the moral requirements of the Mosaic Law, but those of humble state who recognize\n  their dependence on God. Secondly, the Kingdom is a mystery in the sense that messianic\n  servant would come first to <i>redeem </i>a people who would voluntarily subordinate\n  themselves to his rule. The message of the suffering servant who atones for the sins of\n  the people is present in the Old Testament (Is. 52, 53), but it is difficult to grasp in\n  light of the more prominent message of the Davidic King who rules over the earth on behalf\n  of God. The message of the atoning death of the messiah was something that can be clearly\n  seen after the crucifixion of Christ, but which could not be truly understood before hand.\n  That is why when Christ would speak openly of his death and resurrection, even his\n  disciples wondered to themselves what he meant (Mk. 8:31.32; 9:10). It is clear from the\n  teaching of Christ, the testimony of his disciples, and from the message of the rest of\n  scripture, that God intentionally kept hidden the true intent of Christ's mission (see\n  Rom. 16:25-27; 1 Peter 1:10-12).</p>\n  <p>The question of why God wanted the sacrificial death of Christ to be unknown is\n  answered for us in 1 Corinthians 2:6-9. It is in the atonement that God is able to qualify\n  men to enter his kingdom. Had the devil really understood this, he would not have had\n  Christ crucified, knowing that the end of his claim to the earth was eminent. In his\n  death, Christ put to an end the stranglehold of the Satanically-inspired rebellion against\n  God. It is only now, in retrospect, that we can look back into the scripture and see\n  clearly that this was God's plan all along. Now the kingdom of light and the kingdom of\n  darkness exist together. But there is coming a day when Christ will return to establish\n  his rule upon the earth, as the prophets of the Old Testament had envisioned. Between the\n  cross and his return, Christ is expanding his kingdom by persuasion and conversion, not by\n  power and coercion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p><em>Kingdom</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1. Reign (authority to rule). </p>\n  <p>2. Realm (domain of rule).<b></b></p>\n  \n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The kingdom is a time of peace and justice in which god will personally rule. This\n  theme was the hope of the prophets. The \"Day of the Lord\" (Joel 2,3) and the\n  kingdom (Dan. 2:44) refer to the same thing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p><em>Kingdom as present and future.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Proclamation of the kingdom is a crucial aspect of Jesus' teaching. The kingdom is\n  portrayed as both a present reality and a future hope. It is a present reality, in that\n  God offers his rule in the lives of those who would accept his messiah, but future in the\n  sense that God will one day impose his rule without the consent of those under it. The\n  future kingdom is the millennial kingdom established at the end of the age. John the\n  Baptist announced the presence of the kingdom in the ministry of Christ (Mt. 3:2; 4:7).\n  Jesus makes it clear that the kingdom has come in his ministry (Mt. 12:28; 11:12,13). At\n  the same time, Jesus looked to the kingdom as a future hope (Mk. 14:25; Mt. 8:11; Mt.\n  6:10). In his teaching, Jesus offered the kingdom of god to the Jews, but on the spiritual\n  basis of individual repentance and faith, rather than on a politico-nationalistic basis,\n  as they had expected of their messiah. By rejecting Jesus, most of the Jews, including\n  their official leaders, rejected God's rule through the Messiah. Consequently, God has\n  transferred his kingdom to the believing community, the church (Mt. 21:42, 43; Col. 1:13;\n  Rom. 14:17: Ac. 28:23,28-31). Yet, there remains a plan for Israel in the end times</p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p><em>Central themes of the kingdom</em><b></b></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1.

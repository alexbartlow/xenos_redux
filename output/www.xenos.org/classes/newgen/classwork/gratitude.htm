I deserve to feel good and get what I want.</p>\n\n<p>2. If I don't get what I want, I don't have enough.</p>\n\n<p>3. It is very important to have my wants met.</p>\n\n<p>4. It is all right to be angry or depressed if my wants are not met.</p>\n\n<p>5. I don't have to be cheerful or appreciative if I don't feel it.</p>\n\n<p>6. If my parents love me, they will honor my wants.</p>\n<i><b>\n\n</b></i><p>What steps can I take?</p>\n\n<p>1. Require \"please\" and \"thank you\". </p>\n\n<p>2. Be positive in own attitude, avoid complaining about the car, house, income, etc.</p>\n\n<p>3. Don't respond to demanding behavior or use toys or food to get obedience. (not\nreferring to planned positive reinforcement)</p>\n\n<p>4. Avoid \"overbuying\"; they don't need one of every variety of a toy, i.e.\nMatchbox, ponies, Barbies, etc. or a new blouse for every occasion.</p>\n\n<p>5. Don't quickly replace lost or broken toys or allow destructive throwing, jumping on\nthings, etc. (teach respect for property)</p>\n\n<p>6. Actively &amp; regularly point out areas of provision, God's love for us, etc. Ex:\n\"It's so good to have a warm house to live in on a day like this!\", \"I'm\nreally grateful that we have such good food every day.\"</p>\n\n<p>7. Provide opportunity for them to develop generosity.</p>\n<i><b>\n\n</b></i><p>Checks for my attitude:</p>\n\n<p>1. Do I find myself always on the lookout for new (or used) toys, clothes to acquire?</p>\n\n<p>2. How do I represent our situation to my child? \"We don't have enough\", etc.</p>\n\n<p>3. Take joy as a family in just being together; not just in \"things\" oriented\nactivity.</p>\n\n<p>4. Express thankfulness in family prayer time.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/newgen/classwork/index.htm\">previous page</a> \n  \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n</p>\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Goal Worksheet","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/newgen/classwork/gratitude.htm"}

Parents become more willing, even excited, about deeply\nunderstanding and helping their children. When a child comes to them with a problem,\ninstead of thinking, \"Oh no! Not another problem! Their paradigm is,\n\"Here&#x92;s a great opportunity for me to really help my child and to invest in our\nrelationship.\" Many interactions change from transactional to transformational, and\nstrong bonds of love and trust are created as children sense the value parents give to\ntheir problems and to them as individuals.\"</p>\n\n<p>Stephen R.

The first area they deal with is the\nrecognition of the changes that characterize the child&#x92;s life and the family&#x92;s\nlife during this period. They highlight and discuss the changes in a child&#x92;s\nthinking, bodies, hormones and peer relationships and how these changes will affect their\nbehavior. The book also raises areas where parental expectations of the child should\nchange, such as a change from an obedient child to a responsible child. Also, parents are\nchallenged to consider their own parenting styles. Instead of parenting from authority,\nparents should be transitioning to parenting by influence. The authors also emphasize the\nneed to explain the moral principles behind the instructions given to the child.</p>\n\n<p>The second area Ezzo and Buckman stress is the need for a strong family identity. They\ncall for the parents, especially the father, to be willing to sacrifice and spend the time\nand energy to create a strong family unit. To build this sense of family, the authors\nemphasize the need of parents to spend individual time with each child, spend time as a\nfamily, and spend time developing a healthy marriage. The authors assert that a strong\nsense of family is not only needed to develop a child&#x92;s sense of well being, but it\nis essential for the child to withstand negative peer pressure. </p>\n\n<p>The book also contains numerous practical ideas to try and help the reader implement\nsome of their ideas. However, the reader must use their discernment in this area. Some\nideas are good, such as the appeals process, where a child can respectfully introduce new\ninformation that might result in the parent changing his command. On the other hand, some\nsuggested solutions to issues are shallow. The proposed solutions often focus more on\nchanged behavior than helping the child understand the biblical principles involved.</p>\n\n<p><b>Critique:</b> My biggest critique of the book is that Ezzo and Buckman have lowered\nthe goal of biblical parenting. The authors&#x92; goal of parenting is to raise moral\nchildren, not children who love God and others. Therefore, because their goal for\nparenting is off the mark, some of their ideas become suspect. For example, because the\ngoal in parenting is to raise moral children, the authors stress the need to protect\nchildren from inappropriate influences in our culture. I agree there is a need to protect\nour children. However, given the fact that God wants to use our children to communicate\nHis love to the world, we need to teach our kids how to interact with and critique the\nculture we live in. This type of instruction is absent from the book. While this book\ncontains some worthwhile material, it must be read with a critical eye.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/newgen/extra/index.htm\">previous page</a> \n  \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n</p>\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/classes/newgen/graphics/preteenwisecover.jpg","title":"\"On Becoming Preteen Wise\" book review - Patrice McCormac","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/newgen/extra/preeteenwise.htm"}

He claims that the anger and confusion\nof adolescence is due to a negative self concept resulting from not feeling genuinely\nloved and cared for. </p>\n\n<p><b>Chapter 2</b> -- The most important relationship in the home is the marriage. The\nsecurity of a teen is largely dependent on the quality of the marriage. The ability to\ncommunicate feelings, particularly unpleasant feelings, is critical in the marital\nrelationship<b>. </b>He warns against \"role reversal\"&#x97; where parents lean\non their teen as a counselor and confidant.</p>\n\n<p><b>Chapter 3</b> -- The basic foundation for a solid relationship with your teenager is\nunconditional love. If loved unconditionally, he will feel good about himself and be able\nto control his anxiety and behavior<b>.</b> If a parent overreacts emotionally, the lines\nof communication can be broken and the teen may turn to his peers for emotional nurture.\nThe more a parent loses self-control in front of their teen, the less respect the teen\nwill have for them.</p>\n\n<p><b>Chapter 4</b> -- The greatest need a teenager has<b> </b>is for focused attention.<b>\n</b>Without it he feels insecure&#x97;and therefore more influenced by peer pressure.\nAdolescents need MORE time with family not less. </p>\n\n<p><b>Chapter 5</b> -- Appropriate and frequent eye and physical contact are two of the\nmost precious gifts you can give your teenager--touch their shoulder, massage a sore\nmuscle, or scratch their back. </p>\n\n<p><b>Chapter 6</b> &#x96; A terrific chapter on PARENTAL SELF-CONTROL. Emotional\noverreaction tends to cause an adolescent to respect the parent less. How can you expect\ngood self-control from your teenager if you do not have it yourself?<b> </b>Nothing severs\ncommunication with a teen worse than parental anger. </p>\n\n<p><b>Chapter 7</b> &#x96; The best chapter on TEENAGE ANGER! Young people tend to express\nanger immaturely until TRAINED to do otherwise. Campbell&#x92;s Anger Ladder illustrates\nthe different levels of maturity in expressing anger.<b> </b>Passive-aggressive behavior\nis the worst way to express anger. It<b> </b>causes most problems with today&#x92;s\nteenagers from poor grades to drugs and suicide. </p>\n\n<p><b>Chapter 8</b> -- From parent control to self-control. The goal is to control the\nrate by which the teen gains independence based on their level of maturity. </p>\n\n<p><b>Chapter 9</b> -- Teenage depression is difficult to identify because there are often\nno typical signs. In addition to changes in energy, sleep, appetite, and problems handling\nanger, they may have a decreased attention span, poor grades, boredom, physical\ncomplaints, or withdrawal. Boys often act out their depression through stealing/fighting,\nwhereas girls act out sexually.</p>\n\n<p><b>CRITIQUE:</b> Campbell gives some excellent practical advice on how to effectively\ncommunicate unconditional love to teenagers. However, I feel he puts too much emphasis on\nfeelings and self-esteem. He seems to put forth self-esteem as a panacea for all teenage\nproblems: if we can make them feel loved and feel good about themselves, we can prevent\ndepression, substance abuse, or immorality. In addition to his often-simplistic solutions,\nhe also comes across uptight and rigid at times. All in all I would recommend this book,\nespecially the chapters on dealing with anger in our teens and in ourselves.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/newgen/extra/index.htm\">previous page</a> \n  \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n</p>\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"\"How To Really Love Your Teenager\" book review - Amy Merker","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/newgen/extra/loveyourteen.htm"}

The cult of self-esteem, the bonding myth, the myth of the hurried\nchild, the denigration of spirituality, and the misconceived child-centered approach to\neducation have all contributed, says Damon, to the undermining of our children's moral and\nintellectual development.</p>\n\n<p>Drawing on his seminal research and years of work in schools, the author presents a\nprogram that reintroduces intellectual rigor in education, capitalizes on children's\nnative moral virtues, and stems the tide of moral relativism that now dominates our\nschools. Damon shows through his pathbreaking studies that children are highly resilient,\ninnately empathic, and that they thrive on the opportunity to serve others. They also\ncrave difficult challenges, want responsibility, and seek consistent programs of\ndiscipline--qualities that stand in stark opposition to the many popular beliefs about\nchildren's needs.</p>\n\n<p>Drawing on this new knowledge of children, the author then discusses how parents can\ncommunicate values and how they can encourage children to take on personal and social\nresponsibility. He shows how teachers can present rigorous work that challenges children\nbut that also capitalizes on their spontaneous, natural interests. His innovative\neducational program differs from both the rote traditionalist's emphasis on deadly\nstructure for its own sake and the progressive \"child-centered\" approach that\navoids the rigor that children require.\" </p>\n\n<p>William Damon is a professor in the Department of Education at Brown University and\ndirector of its Center for the study of Human Development. He is also author of <i>The\nMoral Child </i>and co-author of <i>Some Do Care. </i>(preceding taken directly from front\nand back covers of book) </p>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Preface</p>\n\n\n<p>Damon states that there is a battle for the future of our society. On the one side,\nthere are many dedicated people working to help youth but on the other side, the problems\nare getting worse--violence, criminality, discouragement and self-destructiveness to name\na few. Poor and rich kids are drifting through childhood without finding the skills and\nvirtues they need to sustain a fruitful life. Commonly accepted standards have fallen\ntremendously and so have children's skills and behaviors. \"But I am convinced that,\nat its core, the predicament that has beset today's youth is one problem and not several.\nOr, a bit more precisely, it is one interconnected <i>web</i> of problems that define a\ncommon pattern. A term that I use to capture the interconnected web is\n'demoralization'&#x85;a loss of moral standards and a debilitating lack of spirit.\"\nThere are many misconceptions about the nature of children and their developmental needs\nwhich may lead parents to shield their children from the formative challenges of\nresponsibility and reality. His thoughts are a combination of new ideas and ageless\nintuitions (i.e. common sense).</p>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Part I The Decline (Chapter 1)</p>\n\n\n<p>Youth violence is increasing. More teenage boys in U.S. die of gunshot wounds than of\nall natural causes combined. (p7). He gives numerous examples and cases. </p>\n\n<p>Suicide rates are increasing. \"A 1993 survey found that 20 percent of high school\nstudents had made a plan to commit suicide and that half of these students had made an\nactual attempt.\" He goes on to say, \"After accidents, suicide is now the leading\ncause of youthful death in our society.\" (p10)</p>\n\n<p>Increase in teenage pregnancies--one root cause of societal disintegration. Drug use\nhas stabilized but is at a dangerously high level.</p>\n\n<p>Quieter indicators--behavioral problems such as gambling, petty theft, habitual\ndeceitfulness, irregular sleeping hours, less mathematically competent than a generation\nago are all up.</p>\n\n<p>The average US child watches 4-5 hours of TV a day with 7-9 hours/day on the weekends\n(p12)</p>\n\n<p>\"In 1989, according to parents and teachers, children were far more likely to\n'destroy things belonging to others,' to 'hang around with others who get into trouble, '\nto do poorly on their schoolwork, to be 'underactive,' 'whining,' 'sullen,' 'stubborn,'\nand 'irritable.' </p>\n\n<p>He introduces some of the misconceptions of modern times (see 1<sup>st</sup> paragraph)\n\"In a literal sense, the most dispiriting result of our myths about children is that\nwe withhold spiritual messages from them. Our reticence springs from the myth of childhood\nincompetence. Many assume that it is an empty exercise to teach religious and moral\nprinciples to children, since they won't be able to understand them. In many educational\nsettings today, spiritual instruction for children has become watered down to the point\nwhere it is hard to discern any meaningful core. &#x85;In fact, children are fascinated by\nthe timeless enigmas of life and death, are not at all threatened by them, and are eager\nto be drawn into discussion about them.\" p25</p>\n\n<p>\"Today's children, like children throughout the ages, do best when they grow up\nwithin a cultural climate of purpose.\" (p25)</p>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Growing Up the Easy Way (Chapter 2)</p>\n\n\n<p>The home has become less a place of work and drudgery and more a place where one is\nfed, sheltered and entertained. In the past, the mutual well-being and even survival of\nall family members depended on children's contributions. \"No longer viewed as an\nessential means to their family's well-being, children now are seen as an end in\nthemselves, the target of their family's care anc concern. Parents strive first and\nforemost to enhance their children's well-being. Childrearing has become the family's\nprimary stated goal. The modern family exists to provide for the children and not the\nother way around. Rather than expecting economic contributions from their children,\nfamilies are ready and willing to dedicate an enormous share of their own resources\ntowards childrearing expenses.\" (p28)</p>\n\n<p>\"Some of these resources are financial: for the decade of the 1990s, the projected\naverage cost of raising a middle-class American child prior to college totals $186,000.\nCollege will ad another sum at least that large for children born today. The other\nvaluable resource that many of today's children enjoy, despite popular beliefs to the\ncontrary, is a large amount of leisure adult time. Today's middle-class children have\ngreater access to adults during times of leisure than children at almost any time history,\nsimply because their elders have been relieved of so much excess work and drudgery\"\n(p28)</p>\n\n<p>\"We spend freely for children's consumer goods ,including designer clothes and\nsneakers, fine furniture, special fun foods, and fancy bikes. It is estimated that U.S.\nfamilies spend over fifty <i>billion </i>dollars yearly on their children's food,\nclothing, entertainment and vacations.\" (p30)</p>\n\n<p>Three broad themes emerge from those who have observed school life today. \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li>Students are passive and disengaged.</li>\n  <li>They are not learning anything close to what they will need to know if they are to\n    thrive in the world of the 21<sup>st</sup> century</li>\n  <li>The critics note that many teachers have become cynical after years of disappointment\n    with their apathetic students, their disjointed instructional requirements, and with the\n    insensitive and invalid tests that they must use to evaluate their students and own\n    teaching performances.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Example of Susan. He knows her parents well. She is bright and gifted and from a family\nwhere intellectual achievement is valued. She does well in one of the top schools.\nRecently she was on a family vacation in a French-speaking sunspot. Susan studied French\nfor years and had great grades. The parents thought that she would be happy to practice\nher French in the real world, to improve and display her expertise. During the trip, her\nparents went out of their way to contact local people who could only speak French. They\nwere surprised that whenever they met someone who spoke French, Susan clammed up. She\navoided speaking French, even when it would have helped the family. She acted as though\nlistening or mouthing the vowels were painful acts. They never thought of their personal\ndaughter as shy. What was going on? They asked her and she clearly said that she was on\nvacation and had no intention of doing anything that vaguely reminded her of school.\nFurthermore, she told them she always hated French. Wasn't it enough the she worked so\nhard for the grades? What did they expect anyway?</p>\n\n<p>Her parent hoped that she would get some pleasure and pride from all her work. That she\nwould show some inclination to use the fruits of her labor for a genuine purpose. Susan is\namong the top of the high-achieving students. </p>\n\n<p>\"In general, our schools are not providing students with environments that\nstimulate intellectual and moral growth.\" Schools aren't the only problem. \"For\nchildren from today's middle-class families, there is one fact of life that stands out.\nAlmost all the activities that occupy most children's nonschool time are directed towards\ntheir own pleasure-oriented diversions. There is a vast amount of time watching TV shows\nfilled with silly humor and gratuitous violence. This is time that is ill-spent, because\nit wastes away precious hours that could be invested in exploring the world and in\nbuilding skills and character.\" (p35)</p>\n\n<p>Throughout history children have been expected to help out in the family. It helps the\nfamily and the child. \"Performing serious service confers a sense of personal\ncompetence and a sense of social responsibility. These virtues are central to the child's\ncharacter development. The earlier that children begin acquiring them, the more surely\nthey will flourish.\" (p 36)</p>\n\n<p>3 Common reasons middle-class parents refrain from requesting service of their\nchildren: \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li>It's more trouble to get children to do something right than simply to do it oneself.</li>\n  <li>They worry their children are already overwhelmed with activities and \"stressed\n    out\" from the demands of modern life. They need more time to cool down.</li>\n  <li>Believe that their children have a \"right\" to their own time.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\"The notion of effort as a virtue in itself--the so-called \"work ethic\"\n-- is rapidly going out of fashion, even in the US, where it once was considered almost\ndefinitional of the national character. Recent student surveys have found that barely more\nthan a quarter of American youngsters place top priority on working hard, as opposed to\nalmost three-quarters of Japanese youth. High school teachers from well-off school\ndistricts routinely quote today's brightest students as saying: \"It's cool to wing\nit; to do the least work possible and get away with it;\" or, It's the American\nway--to get the best results with the least amount of energy expended.\" (p37)</p>\n\n<p>Test scores are going down, waist sizes are going up. </p>\n\n<p>\"Yet the heart of the matter still remains the loss of all obligations to serve\nanyone beyond oneself. Even if our children were being raised to become the best informed,\nmost artistic, and healthiest children that the world has ever seen, it would all come to\nnothing unless they found some things beyond themselves, and indeed some people other than\nthemselves, to devote at least a part of their efforts to.\" (p 38)</p>\n\n<p>He gives numerous examples at the end of the chapter of about youth violence in\nmiddle-class neighborhoods.</p>\n\n<p>Failure to guide the development of young people in affluent conditions can lead to\nnarcissism, depression, underachievement, and antisocial and self-destructive behaviors.</p>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Growing Up the Hard Way (Chapter 3)</p>\n\n\n<p>In previous generations in the inner-city neighborhoods, there were constructive\nmentoring relationships. Now, drug traffickers, pimps and gangs are everywhere. In the\npast, relationships were based on mutual trust and care. The newer ones are founded upon\ninstrumental ends rather than interpersonal ones -- conducted with deceit and\nself-protectiveness rather than honesty and respect. Children are now a means for someone\nelse's profit and pleasure.</p>\n\n<p>Successful youth organizations: \n\n</p><ul type=\"SQUARE\">\n  <li>ensure physical survival of children</li>\n  <li>safe haven</li>\n  <li>give child identity as member of organized group</li>\n  <li>local community credibility and stability in staffing</li>\n  <li>include all youth who seek them out</li>\n  <li>engage young in activities that reflect a sense of purpose</li>\n  <li>high expectations for behavior</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Failure to guide the development of young people in impoverished conditions can lead to\nyouth gangs terrorizing neighborhoods, school prison rates increasing, teenage pregnancies\nincreasing and youth who grow up devoid of hope or dreams.</p>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Misconceptions of Modern Times, I The Elevation of Self and Derogation of the Spirit\n(Chapter 4)</p>\n\n\n<p>\"A common refrain in today's popular discourse about human development is the\nprimary importance of self-esteem.\" The idea, baldly stated, is that it is impossible\nto respect, cherish, or love others without first learning to respect and love\noneself.\" (p68) \"The 'how to' childrearing books are liberally dosed with tips\nfor bolstering children's self-esteem. Many explicitly claim that self-esteem is a prior\ncondition--and a necessary one--for a child's optimal psychological development. They also\nemphasize the importance of early experience in either establishing or permanently\nimpairing a child's self-esteem.\" He quotes from several books about the utter\nimportance of instilling a healthy self-esteem in your child.</p>\n\n<p>\"&#x85;Self-esteem is assumed to cause many positive and important developmental\noutcomes, ranging from intelligence to mental health&#x85;The notion that self-esteem is a\n<i>prior cause</i> of these positive outcomes derives, illegitimately, from correlating\nstudies that show no more than simple association between measures of self-esteem and\nmeasures of achievement, health and so on. Every statistics lesson taught anywhere begins\nby explaining that <i>correlations do not establish causality. </i>No matter how many\ncorrelations are found between self-esteem and anything else, self-esteem is just as\nlikely to be a result of the positive development outcomes as it is to be a <i>cause</i>\nof them.</p>\n\n<p>\"The psychological danger of putting the child at the center of all things, of\nmaking children too conscious of themselves and their own feelings, is that it draws the\nchild's attention away from fundamental social realities to which the child must adapt for\nproper character development. When children learn to place themselves first, they learn to\ncare more about their own personal experience than about the feelings and reactions of\nothers. They come to ignore the guidance and feedback of others, because they have never\nlearned to value it. They fail to establish a firm basis for respecting others, including\neven the important adults in their lives. In the long run, they learn to act as their own\nsole moral self-referents, which is not a good way to develop a balanced moral\nsense.\" (p78)</p>\n\n<p>\"The pursuit of self-esteem is everyone's right. It is an important part of\npsychological adjustment to cultivate the sense of well-being that lies at the center of\npersonal happiness. But the pursuit of self-esteem in and of itself is a misdirected\nquest. It is a logical and a psychological contradiction in terms. One cannot\n\"find\" self-esteem in isolation from one's relations to others because it does\nnot exist apart form those relationships.\" (p80)</p>\n\n<p>\"Parents and teachers serve their children best when they guide their children\ntowards the skills, knowledge, and relationships that eventually lead to genuine\nself-esteem. Parents serve their children poorly when they engender in them an artificial\nbelief in their own importance. There are no shortcuts to the real thing.\" (pp80-1)</p>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Nothing to Believe In</p>\n\n\n<p>\"When we teach children to concern themselves first and foremost with their own\nsense of self, we not only encourage self-centeredness but also fail to present a more\ninspiring and developmentally constructive alternative: that they should concern\nthemselves about things <i>beyond</i> the self and <i>above</i> the self. We fail, that\nis, to convey to them a sense that there are other important things in life beyond their\nown individual circumstances and feelings&#x85;Even at early ages, children need something\nbeyond themselves to believe in&#x85;Self-centered goals cannot provide a constructive\nfoundation for a child's development. Children will not thrive psychologically until they\nlearn to dedicate themselves to purposes that go beyond their own egoistic desires. They\nwill not thrive unless they acquire a living sense of what some religious traditions have\ncalled <i>transcendence</i>: a faith in, and devotion to concerns that are considered\nlarger than the self. In a child's world, the clearest example of this is a sense of\nservice to others. But it also may include beliefs about profound matters such as the\nmeaning and purpose of life.\" (p81)</p>\n\n<p>\"In just the last few years, some of our most noted authorities on childrearing\nhave woken up to the glaring omission of spiritual messages from our children's\nlives.\" (p82) He goes on to quote Benjamin Spock from a recent statement:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>I have hopes that enough people will come to recognize the social ills\n    and tragedies stemming from our spiritual poverty, or be shocked by some economic or\n    environmental disaster, or be inspired by a spiritual leader, so that they will dedicate\n    themselves to the ideal of service to their fellow humans, whatever their gainful\n    occupations, and inspire in their children a similar ideal. I literally believe that\n    without such a conversion, our singleminded dedication to materialism will do us in. I'm\n    not basing this on religious or moral grounds but simply on the evidence that our society\n    is disintegrating. (p82-3)</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"The surest way to breed incompetence (and low self-esteem of the\nreal kind) in a child is to treat the child as incompetent. If a parent assumes that a\nchild cannot be counted on to accomplish a task, the child takes that message to\nheart&#x85;.In actuality, children are far more competent at early ages than adults in our\nsociety give them credit for. They thrive on challenges and on chances to prove\nthemselves. Competence motivation is a natural part of every child's repertoire. If\nencouraged, it enables children to develop their capacities with zest and vigor.\"\n(p84)</p>\n\n<p>\"Sparing children from demanding challenges, and in particular\nfrom all expectations of service to others, does them a disservice; because it robs them\nof opportunities to establish their sense of competence and the sense of social\nresponsibility. It imparts to children exactly the wrong pair of messages: (1) that they\nare incapable of accomplishing anything and (2) that they are living only for themselves.\nThe first message belies the child's natural endowment of intelligence, hardiness, and\nenergy. The second goes against the grain of what it means to be a fully developed\nhuman.\" (p85) </p>\n\n<p>He gives three misconceptions about children's spiritual beliefs: (1)\nfallacy that young children are unable to understand or appreciate spiritual messages (2)\nmisplaced fear that children will be damaged by exposure to other people's spiritual and\nreligious beliefs (3) spirituality itself is somehow maladaptive--or at least quaintly\nirrelevant--in our modern, technological society. (p86)</p>\n\n<p>\"Our society discourages children's spiritual growth in countless\nways. ..the fostering of self-centeredness and the withholding of expectations for\nservice.\" (p92)</p>\n\n<p>\"Children are not so easily wounded or led astray. They are\nresilient, purposeful, and intellectually capable--no doubt far more so than most adults\ngive them credit for being.\" (p92)</p>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Misconceptions of Modern Times, II The False Oppositions (Chapter 5)</p>\n\n\n<p>\"Of all the distortions in today's public conversations about youth, the most\ndisturbing is the unnecessary polarization of opinions about education and childrearing.\nOppositional thinking rules the day.\" (i.e. At school, teach subject matter or\nthinking skills; school playful or rigorous; read through phonics or whole language;\nemphasize character or academics; habits or reflection. At home, freedom or duty,\nself-expression or discipline, etc.) p95</p>\n\n<p>He goes on to talk about how all of this oppositional thinking leads to paralysis among\nthe adults who should be working together to help children rather than fighting against\neach other. (in government, schools, communities and homes)</p>\n\n<p>He then begins a lengthy discussion on Child-centered imbalances vs. Adult-centered\nimbalances.</p>\n\n<p>Briefly, child-centered imbalances have led to exaggerated concerns about children's\nmomentary feelings, discouraged attempts to inspire achievement among children and have\neroded the foundations of parental discipline.</p>\n\n<p>Adult-centered imbalances have led to the bonding myth&#x97;that people may be\npermanently impaired by a lack of physical contact with their biological mothers in the\nhours after birth. \"The focus on bonding has stolen attention from the real essential\nneed of all young children: regular participation in at least one secure, growth-inducing\nrelationship.\" (p113)</p>\n\n<p>\"&#x85;Discipline in the home has become a vexing dilemma rather than an art that\ncomes naturally to parents. It has become, in fact, a lost art. Stories about unruly,\ndisrespectful, and unmanageable children dominate the conversations of adults everywhere.\nFamilies are torn with division over how to respond.\" (p115)</p>\n\n<p>Then there are huge disagreements over how to discipline.</p>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Part III -- The Response</p>\n\n<p>The Natural Virtues (Chapter 6)</p>\n\n\n<p>His main point here is that children are born \"far stronger, far more adaptive,\nand far more disposed towards developing moral character than our present-day thinking and\npractices have given them credit for. It would aid our childrearing efforts immensely if\nwe would see the child's natural virtues for what they are.\" (p126)</p>\n\n<p>Years ago grandmas knew that kids are resilient. Today, we have what one book called,\nthe \"too-precious child\" syndrome among many families. \"A sense of\npreciousness in turn can lead to exaggerated concerns over children's health, safety, and\nemotional well-being. It is not that parents are mistaken to be concerned about such\nthings: parents' fist responsibility is to protect their children, and every child\ndeserves a safe and nurturing home. But such concerns must be realistically targeted at\nchildren's actual vulnerabilities. When they are not, protection turns to overprotection,\nand children are robbed of the chance to develop their own protective skills. This is why\nit is so important to start with an accurate view of children's natural strengths.\"\n(p127)</p>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Four Natural Dispositions for Adaptation and Learning (pp128-9) \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li><i>Children thrive on challenges. </i>They are always in search of ways to gain skills\n    and prove themselves</li>\n  <li><i>Children are curious about the mysteries of life and are capable of understanding\n    serous discussion about grave matters. </i>Children become less troubled by frank and open\n    discussions of death than by the hushed, secretive posture that many adults believe to be\n    protective of children's sensibilities. Children require thoughtful and honest answers. </li>\n  <li><i>Children adjust quickly to change and are not readily traumatized. </i>Children are\n    resilient. Rare to have genuine childhood trauma. \"The medical adage that a bone is\n    strongest at a place where it was broken has its parallel in psychological development as\n    well.\"</li>\n  <li><i>Children are active interpreters of their own experience.</i> Children make sense out\n    of the world in their own way--incisive and stubbornly resistant to either manipulation or\n    deception. (This means that children are not susceptible to instant molding by adverse\n    influences such as \"peer pressure,\" rock and roll, or unsavory TV programming.)</li>\n</ol>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>The Moral Virtues</p>\n\n\n<p>\"While the child's moral sense is by no means dominant on every occasion, it is as\nmuch a part of the child's natural way of responding to the world as is any of the child's\nother inclinations, dispositions, or drives. It cannot be stamped out or subjugated for\nlong.\" (p131)</p>\n\n<p>\"The seeds of the moral sense are sown at conception, and its roots are firmly\nestablished at birth. Every infant enters this world prepared to respond socially, and in\na moral manner, to others. Every child has the capacity to acquire moral character. The\nnecessary emotional response systems, budding cognitive awareness, and personal\ndispositions are there from the start. Although, unfortunately, every child does not grow\ninto a responsible and caring person, the potential to do so is native to every member of\nthe species.\" (p132)</p>\n\n<p>He goes into a detailed discussion on the moral emotions, moral judgment, social\ncognition and self-understanding of children. I suspect this is mostly from his book on\nthe Moral Child, so I will skip this part.</p>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>A Framework of Guidance for Children's Intellectual and Moral Growth (Chapter 7)</p>\n\n\n<p>\"The metaphor that will run throughout this chapter is that socialization is a\nbridge-building process linking the child's spontaneous experiences to the ideas and\nvalues that adults must transmit.\" (p 144)</p>\n\n<p>\"The main task of socialization is to impart the invaluable tools of a culture to\nits young people. The tools may include knowledge, skills, habits, attitudes, values,\npractices, understandings, and a host of other mental and behavioral products of\nlearning.\" (pp 144-5)</p>\n\n<p>Respectful engagement: (p149) \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li>creating a dialogue or a project in which the adult and the child share a common\n    interest</li>\n  <li>structuring the dialogue or the project in ways that introduce the adult's intellectual\n    or moral agenda to the child</li>\n  <li>encouraging the child to participate actively in the dialogue or venture and allowing\n    the child's free expression of beliefs (however wrong these beliefs may seem); and </li>\n  <li>expressing, in ways that the child can comprehend, the adult's own perspective. All four\n    conditions are necessary if the adult is to have a lasting, constructive influence on the\n    child's perspective.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This chapter is where he goes into authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive\nparenting styles. (p 150)</p>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Socialization for Character: The Joining of Habit and Reflection</p>\n\n\n<p>You can't polarize the two, must focus on both. </p>\n\n<p>\"Young people must learn to act rightly habitually, as a matter of course. The\nmoral life is built primarily on good habits. It is important that young people learn to\nresist immoral temptations in the same automatic way that most people refrain, without\nhesitation, from robbing a helpless beggar or hurting their loved ones. But reflection,\nwhen grounded in good values, supports rather than deflects the habitual moral response.\nMoreover, reflection is one way to guard against that periodic human tendency to blindly\nstumble into horrendous moral mistakes. Only when habit and reflection marry does\nsustained moral commitment become possible. It is such commitment, and no less, that we\nmust aim for in our children. It is this goal that must drive our socialization\npractices.\" (p 158)</p>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Parenting (Chapter 8)</p>\n\n\n<p>He talks about how difficult it is to parent today. Parents are fearful of many things\nincluding: children's emotional blackmail when they don't get their way; disappointing\nchildren; harming them by being insensitive or inattentive; living in a dangerous world;\npressure to provide the best of everything; not doing enough for a gifted child; and the\nlist goes on and on. He says that Penelope Leach is among the most widely read of today's\nchildrearing experts <i>(Your Baby and Child from Birth to Age Five). (p 166)</i></p>\n\n<p>He talks about the need for a dynamic interaction between the perspectives of child and\nadult. \"This is the reason that authoritative parenting helps children develop what\nresearchers have identified as \"instrumental competence\" and \"personal and\nsocial responsibility\"--the virtues that I have abbreviated as competence and\ncharacter. This is also the reason that authoritarian and permissive parenting both tend\nto leave children unprepared for such growth. These two styles fail in similar ways for\nopposite reasons. In the authoritarian style, children cannot find sustaining rationales\nfor the rules that their parents impose (and sometimes they cannot even find the rules,\nsince authoritarian commands often mutate in accord with a parent's erratic whims). In the\npermissive style, there are no firm external standards to begin with, so the child drifts\nwithout direction in a limitless fog of impulse. In both cases, the child ends up\nuninstructed and unguided. Authoritative parenting works where the others fail because it\nbuilds a communicational bridge to the child while at the same time directing the child to\nthe standards and skills of the adult&#x85;the common theme among these methods is that\nthey all stress both communication and control, both respect for the child's perspective\nand commitment to the adult's standards.\" (p171)</p>\n\n<p>He also refers to psychologist Theodore Dix's work on three broad classes of parental\ngoals: empathetic (make a child feel happy, comforting child in distress, assuaging\nchild's pain or hunger, etc); socialization (oriented towards children's learning and\ndevelopment--they benefit children but don't necessarily please them) and self-goals\n(goals oriented towards a parent's own needs and wishes) getting child in bed so you can\nread a book; they are aimed at pleasing the parent. Parents may lean towards one class of\ngoals or they may combine them. The child's socialization suffers when parents pursue\neither empathic or self-goals singlemindedly. This often leads to imbalances of Chapter 5.\nChildren's developmental needs are often ignored when empathic or self-goals are pursued\nsinglemindedly. \"Concerns about the child's socialization still arise; but they arise\nsuddenly, in a disruptive manner, and in contexts that are neither engaging nor\ninstructive for the child.</p>\n\n<p>He then gets into discipline and some of the views out there today. \"The classic\nauthoritarian strategy for discipline is <i>power assertion</i>. This method consists of\ncoercion and threats of punishment when children refuse to conform to parental wishes.\nOften parents attempt to force children to adopt new attitudes and behavior through\nunmitigated assertions of their power, backed up by severe sanctions for disobedience.\nThis can be highly effective in the short term, particularly when the adult is there to\nenforce the sanctions. But experimental evidence has shown that power assertion does not\nlead to long-lasting, dependable formation of habits or beliefs. For one thing, its\neffectiveness fades when parents are absent.\" (pp178-9)</p>\n\n<p>\"A more subtle and indirect disciplinary strategy is <i>love withdrawal</i>.\nParents implicitly threaten to withdraw their love from a child through direct expressions\nof disapproval. (\"I don't like you when you act like that!\") Through emotional\ncoldness, or through expressions of disappointment and disinterest, such as ignoring the\nchild for a long period of time after a disobedient act. Observations of contemporary\nparenting have shown that many parents use love withdrawal in response to all types of\nchild misdeeds, including harm to persons, harm to property, and loss of self-control.\nIndeed, love withdrawal is a more effective strategy of gaining immediate compliance from\nchildren than power assertion. But despite its immediate effectiveness, love withdrawal\ncannot accomplish the main goal of socialization: influencing children to adopt improved\nattitudes and behavior that children will consider to be their own. There is no evidence\nthat love withdrawal leads to the internalization of habit or beliefs. Rather, love\nwithdrawal only leads to limited changes in children's over behavior. It may increase the\nlikelihood that children will 'put on a good show' and inhibit any tendencies they might\nhave to be discourteous or disobedient. But it does not lead to the adoption of permanent\nnew standards that children will maintain on their own, apart from any consequences having\nto do with their parents' approval.\" (pp179-80)</p>\n\n<p>\"A third disciplinary strategy has been identified in the work of developmental\npsychologist Martin Hoffman as \"<i>informational internalization</i>\" or, more\nplainly, <i>induction</i>. According to Hoffman's observations, disciplinary techniques\nthat induce children to internalize key information about the parent's directives are the\nones that are most successful at permanently changing children's attitudes and behavior.\nsuch techniques succeed because they lead children to understand, and accept, the\nstandards that their parents are trying to communicate rather than focusing only on the\nsanctions through which parents enforce these standards. An effective parental influence\nencounter, Hoffman writes, will ensure that the aspect of the encounter most salient to\nthe child will be the attitude or behavior that the parent is trying to instill rather\nthan the child's punishment for refusing to comply. In the most productive of such\nencounters, the child may forget the sanction entirely. In fact, the child even may\neventually forget the parent's role in promoting the standard: the child will come to\nendorse the standard so wholeheartedly that its origin becomes irrelevant. This does not\nmean, however, that the origin of the standard is immaterial in a developmental sense.\nWithout the parent's introduction and inducement of the standard, the child may never have\ncome to it. In contrast to power assertion or love withdrawal, induction fosters the\npermanent internalization of moral habits and standards. The way in which this works can\nbe seen most clearly in the context of a typical disciplinary encounter between parent and\nchild. Right before such an encounter, the child has acted in an improper way. The parent\nthen may stop the child's actions; or the parent may punish the child after the fact. In\neither case, the child will not be likely to repeat the unwelcome act in the parent's\nimmediate presence. But will the child continue to refrain from this behavior when the\nparent is not around? This depends upon the type of discipline that the parent\nadministers. If a discipline method is to foster moral internalization, it must use reason\nand explanation to induce the child to anticipate the effect of behavior on others. Such\ninductions can take many forms, depending upon the situation and upon the age of the\nchild. For example, an induction to a very young child will emphasize the direct effects\nof the child's actions: 'If you keep pushing him, he'll fall down and cry.' With an older\nchild, the parent may focus upon the fairness of child's actions in terms of the others'\nactions and intentions\" 'Don't yell at him, he was only trying to help.' Or the\nparent may point to the psychological, rather than the physical effect of the child's\nactions: 'He feels bad because he was proud of his tower and you knocked it down.'\nInductions nourish the child's concern for others, and they offer the child information\nabout how his behavior can adversely affect others. Such information helps a child better\nunderstand interpersonal causality (that is, the relation between the child's own act and\nthe physical and psychological well-being of another); although, as I noted above, the\nchild's maturity places some limits on the type of inductive information that the child is\nable to process.\" (pp 180-1) He also talks about the need at times, to combine mild\nforms of power assertion or love withdrawal with induction to get the child in an\n\"optimal state of arousal\" and influence the child.</p>\n\n<p>The minimal sufficiency principle of socialization \"states that the most effective\nmethods of permanently improving a child's behavior are those that are applied with just\nenough coercion or reward to engage the child in the new behavior but not so much coercion\nor reward that the child finds this to be the most memorable part of the experience. In\nother words, the external incentives that the adult provides must be minimally sufficient\nto change the child's behavior without being more salient in themselves than the standards\nthat the adult is trying to promote. Under these conditions, the child&#x92;s attitudes\nand behavior will be permanently transformed, because the child will internalize the new\nstandards. (p 183)</p>\n\n<p>\"Informational internalization through induction, the minimal sufficiency\nprinciple, and authoritative parenting in general, all share an interactive approach to\nsocialization. In each of these strategies, long-lasting influence upon a child's behavior\nis achieved through consistent and reasonable family controls along with clear parental\ncommunications to the child about the moral significance of the controls. The controls\nmust be convincing, but they should only be mildly arousing in an emotional state. The\ncommunications must be adapted to the child's developing cognitive abilities, so that the\nparent's message of moral significance may be understood by the child.\" (p 184)</p>\n\n<p>\"Beyond socialization practices, the very nature of the parent/child relationship\nitself provides a communicational vehicle for the parent's standards. An honest\nrelationship imparts the standard of truth more clearly than any disciplinary encounter.\nAn empathic relationship demonstrates the value of empathy more powerfully than any lesson\nor induction. Children's relations with their parents are among the closest and\nlongest-lasting interpersonal relations that they will ever have. Participating in a\nparent/child relationship that is caring, responsible, truthful, and fair offers the child\na magnificent moral education in and of itself.\" (p 187)</p>\n\n<p>\"The moral quality of the parent/child relationship overrides all other\ncommunications that the parent might attempt&#x85;. When the quality of the relationship\nis in line with the parent's message, the message becomes convincing to the child. When a\nparent's socialization practices are also sound, a positive, enduring and powerful\ninfluence on the child's character is established.\" (p 188)</p>\n\n<p>The remaining two chapters of the book deal with schools and the community.

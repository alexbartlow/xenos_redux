When we come close\n    to meeting them, we feel content &amp; competent. When we don&#x92;t we feel guilty or\n    anxious.</li>\n</ul>\n<i><b>\n\n</b></i><p>9 Principles for Parenting in Reality \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li>Trying to communicate like an adult with your child leads to frustration. Focus on\n    listening &amp; tuning into the emotions rather than the actual words.</li>\n  <li>If you are angry, say so. But do it in such a way that it doesn&#x92;t insult or blame</li>\n  <li>Trying to \"do it all\" is a guaranteed path to burnout. Sometimes we help most\n    by not helping.</li>\n  <li>Feelings aren&#x92;t good or bad, they just are.</li>\n  <li>Punishment as a means of correction isn&#x92;t enough. We need to teach appropriate\n    behavior through discipline.</li>\n  <li>Words have tremendous power to heal, affirm &amp; guide our children.</li>\n  <li>When we acknowledge our child&#x92;s strong negative emotions instead of trying to\n    change them, we communicate acceptance at a time when our child needs it the most.</li>\n  <li>We help our child by preparing them to make good decisions. One way to do this is\n    teaching by using consequences.</li>\n  <li>We communicate dignity &amp; respect to our child. We avoid shaming them.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<ul>\n  <b>\n  <li>Chapter 4- Hurried, Hassled, and Hushed</li>\n  </b>\n</ul>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>The relaxed parent understands the trends affecting children in order to understand his\nown children.</p>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Ten Trends in Childhood \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li><u>Less Supervision</u> &#x96; Mom&#x92;s used to be home &amp; available but not in\n    today&#x92;s world. Less supervision leads to more independence. Children are left alone\n    at an earlier age. They are expected to become independent &amp; are often hurried to\n    achieve separation from parents. They are being rushed towards independence.</li>\n  <li><u>Too Many Choices</u> &#x96; \"Young people today are freer than ever before to\n    engage in sexual activity, to abuse drugs and to flout adult authority. At the same time,\n    they are less prepared than ever before to manage these new freedoms.\" David Elkind,\n    \"The Hurried Child\"</li>\n  <li><u>A Rush to Adulthood </u>&#x96; Instead of sheltering &amp; bestowing our love, we\n    treat our children like another task. We want them to grow up in a hurry &amp; we\n    don&#x92;t protect them from the worries of the adult world.</li>\n  <li><u>Loss of Innocence </u>&#x96; All of this adult-like behavior &amp; exposure leads to\n    a loss of child like innocence.</li>\n  <li><u>More Single Parents </u>&#x96; The disappearance of marriage as a dependable,\n    permanent structure within which children can live out their childhood is surely the most\n    consequential change that has occurred in the last two decades. Children begin to\n    consider, \"<i>Who will take care of me if my parents can&#x92;t even take care of\n    themselves?</i>\"</li>\n  <li><u>No More Heroes </u>&#x96; Kids used to have heroes for role models. Now they have\n    celebrities, Michael Jackson, Madonna, yuck! Children in our country are desperately in\n    need of guides &#x96; people who know the path &amp; are willing to show the way.</li>\n  <li><u>Blurring of Roles &amp; Boundaries </u>&#x96; It used to be kids were kids &amp;\n    adults were adults, it is kind of blurry today. Two technologies largely responsible for\n    pulling down boundaries &amp; making children grow up prematurely are the Internet &amp;\n    television sets. Parents need to restore the \"top shelf\". There are certain\n    things children shouldn&#x92;t be exposed to until they are older.</li>\n  <li><u>The End of Play </u>&#x96; Children often have busy schedules, so busy that their\n    play is scheduled, structured &amp; not always relaxing. They work more than they play.\n    All this scheduling limits our children&#x92;s creativity &amp; experiences with us. </li>\n  <li><u>Critical Decisions Too Early </u>&#x96; <i>\"Am I gay?\"</i> Children absorb\n    what they are exposed to. They may not fully understand but will process it as best they\n    can. It won&#x92;t go over their heads if they aren&#x92;t ready for it; it will go into\n    their heads, ready or not.</li>\n  <li><u>Receiving Parents&#x92; Money Instead of Time </u>&#x96; We try to replace ourselves\n    with stuff.</li>\n</ol>\n<i><b>\n\n</b></i><p>The Outcome: STRESS</p>\n\n\n<p>As a result of being hurried, hassled &amp;\nhushed, children are also hostile. </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <b>\n  <li>Chapter 5- Princes and Princesses</li>\n  </b>\n</ul>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>The relaxed parent prepares his children for life by treating them as family members,\nnot guests. \n\n</p><ul>\n  <li>Kids today have high expectations. A taste for perfection &amp; a distaste for\n    discomfort. Everything must be fun &amp; they must have it now.</li>\n  <li>When we give our kids everything, it robs them of the joy of anticipation. It replaces\n    wonder with an ugly sense of entitlement.</li>\n  <li>Why do we do this? To keep them from struggling. To meet their needs &amp; wants. To\n    keep them from failure.</li>\n  <li>Feeling that one is the center of the universe does not prepare a person to meet the\n    demands of an intimate relationship, which requires compromise, negotiation, an\n    extraordinary capacity to give, and caring as deeply for another as one does for oneself.</li>\n  <li>Our obsession with our children feeling good is not producing children who feel good.\n    Our children need to learn that life is not pain-free and that disappointments, sacrifices\n    &amp; occasional failures are as much a part of life as party favors, soccer camps &amp;\n    Nintendo 64.</li>\n  <li>How can we distinguish between needs &amp; wants? Needs are basic biological needs,\n    wants are everything else.</li>\n  <li>Individuals are important for what they can contribute to the community, not for their\n    distinctive individuality.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<ul>\n  <b>\n  <li>Chapter 6- Spoiled-Rotten Kids</li>\n  </b>\n</ul>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>The relaxed parent chooses to not give children too much, recognizing to do so may be\ngiving them too little.</p>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Why We Give In To Our Children \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li><u>As a substitute for time</u> &#x96; it helps reduce our feelings of guilt.</li>\n  <li><u>To avoid confrontation </u>&#x96; tired &amp; busy parents don&#x92;t want to fight.\n    It takes too much energy.</li>\n  <li><u>To compensate for our own childhood </u>&#x96; we want to treat our kids better than\n    our parents treated us.</li>\n  <li><u>To maintain social status </u>&#x96; we don&#x92;t want our kids to be\n    \"branded\".</li>\n</ol>\n<i><b>\n\n</b></i><p>Traits of Spoiled Rotten Kids \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li><u>Feeling Bored</u> &#x96; \"What have you done for me lately?\" </li>\n  <li><u>Demanding </u>&#x96; They want the best &amp; they want it now!</li>\n  <li><u>Addiction to Having &amp; Doing the Latest Fashion </u>&#x96; kids are addicted to\n    peer approval.</li>\n  <li><u>Lack of Sensitivity </u>&#x96; they become more &amp; more self-centered &amp;\n    typically lack compassion.</li>\n  <li><u>Lack of Self-Discipline </u>&#x96; haven&#x92;t learned the value of persistence.</li>\n  <li><u>Selective Truth </u>&#x96; honesty is not a value, comfort &amp; freedom are\n    esteemed.</li>\n  <li><u>Problems with Performance &amp; Competition </u>&#x96; seldom good sports.

We think more logical &amp; linear,\n    teen conversation is more random &amp; nonsequential, in other words, chaotic.</li>\n  <li>Trying to get all the answers &amp; understand drives kids batty.

This takes inner\n    motivation.</li>\n  <li>Parents are either raising characters or building characters.</li>\n</ul>\n<i><b>\n\n</b></i><p>Ten Tips for Motivating Your Child \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li><u>Allow your child to fail</u> &#x96; we rob our kids of motivation when we rescue\n    them.</li>\n  <li><u>Give your child regular household responsibilities </u>&#x96; when we affirm our\n    child&#x92;s contribution, they begin to see that they are needed &amp; have something\n    valuable to offer. It builds their self-esteem.</li>\n  <li><u>Decide to limit what you give your child </u>&#x96; be concerned with their needs,\n    not their wants. Waiting develops self-control for their later years.</li>\n  <li><u>Teach &amp; model respect for people &amp; property </u>&#x96; teach them to care for\n    &amp; value what belongs to them. They must understand the value of property to respect\n    another&#x92;s possessions. Model respect by being on time, be courteous with service\n    people (waitresses, cashiers, etc.), drive courteously &amp; don&#x92;t criticize behind\n    someone&#x92;s back. (Your kid is watching!)</li>\n  <li><u>Build into your child the value of completion </u>&#x96; limit their activities &amp;\n    teach them completion, a sense of achievement &amp; closure. Otherwise, they learn if\n    something gets tough, just quit (won&#x92;t work at a job or in a marriage).</li>\n  <li><u>Limit exposure to media </u>&#x96; they are drowning in information &amp; starved for\n    knowledge. When kids are over-stimulated with information they become passive &amp;\n    apathetic. Encourage them to read &amp; think, daily.</li>\n  <li><u>Teach &amp; model personal virtues over conformity</u> &#x96; honesty, faith, hope,\n    courage &amp; love are more important than social status. </li>\n  <li><u>Hold your child personally accountable </u>&#x96; children should be responsible for\n    what they say &amp; do. There are always consequences for the choices we make in life.</li>\n  <li><u>Work together </u>&#x96; projects (school, home, etc.) build relationships. We build\n    motivation when we create opportunities to serve together.</li>\n  <li><u>Play together </u>&#x96; when parents &amp; children relax, laugh &amp; enjoy each\n    other, it builds a bond. Having fun is motivating.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<ul>\n  <b>\n  <li>Chapter 12 - Teaching Response-ability</li>\n  </b>\n</ul>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>The relaxed parent turns over areas of response-ability to his children to help them\nlearn from the consequences. \n\n</p><ul>\n  <li>Children know us well &amp; how we will respond. The problem becomes, \"who is\n    training who?\"</li>\n  <li>Discipline them to learn right behavior, the ability to respond properly to life\n    situations, \"response-ability\".</li>\n  <li>Discipline is the deliberate creation of stress in your relationship with your child for\n    the purpose of helping him or her grow &amp; learn.</li>\n  <li>Discipline focuses on learning &amp; growing. Punishment focuses on behavior &amp;\n    rule-keeping.</li>\n  <li>Consequences are tools, not rules. Choose the consequences, inform your children &amp;\n    stick to them.</li>\n  <li>Natural vs. logical consequences discussed.</li>\n  <li>We need to choose our battles wisely or we will be battling all the time.

Remember that rules without\n    relationship lead to rebellion.</li>\n  <li>Make sure the guidelines are clear. Remember that relationship without rules leads to\n    anarchy.</li>\n  <li>Set boundaries even if they are unpopular. Remember that families are not to be\n    democracies; they are to be run by parents, not children.</li>\n  <li>Connect freedom with responsibility.

The values we hope to see lived out by our children\n    will most likely be the values they see lived out in us.</li>\n  <li>Affirm character more than achievement. Affirmation of your child&#x92;s character\n    builds character. Praise for your child&#x92;s achievement builds performance.</li>\n  <li>Our children&#x92;s happiness should not be our first concern. Their growth should be.\n    Have one area in mind, which you can help your child grow.</li>\n  <li>Include the child in developing consequences. For logical consequences to work, they\n    must seem logical to the child.</li>\n  <li>Meet as a family once a week to plan schedules, teach values &amp; show love to each\n    other.</li>\n  <li>Be human enough to your kids to share your weaknesses as well as your strengths. Be\n    honest in your relationships with your children.</li>\n  <li>Define one character quality you&#x92;d like to see developed in your child. Our goal\n    should be to develop our child&#x92;s character, not promote his popularity.</li>\n  <li>Have a weekly family fun time. Parents who have fun with their children have more energy\n    to discipline &#x96; but don&#x92;t need to.</li>\n  <li>Schedule a one-on-one date with each of your kids at least monthly.</li>\n  <li>Include the children in planning the family vacation, including the budget.</li>\n  <li>Be willing to say no to inappropriate requests. This teaches your child respects for the\n    needs of others.</li>\n  <li>A long-term focus mean being committed to your child&#x92;s needs, not simply his wants.\n    Say yes when you can and no when you must.</li>\n  <li>Affirm your children&#x92;s individuality within the context of community. Affirm how\n    they are unique, but connect that distinctive with their contribution to the\n    \"team\" &amp; eventually the community.</li>\n  <li>Enforce consequences to not forgo necessary discipline. Discipline is the deliberate\n    creation of stress to help your child grow &amp; learn. Don&#x92;t be afraid of the added\n    stress.</li>\n  <li>If your children misbehave in restaurants or grocery stores, take away a privilege. Next\n    time, come prepared to play a game to help entertain them. Ask for a kid&#x92;s menu. Have\n    him hunt for certain objects in each store aisle. Remind him to behave so he won&#x92;t\n    lose his privilege again.</li>\n  <li>If your children fight over the front seat, assign the seat a month at a time.</li>\n  <li>Have family reading hours. Don&#x92;t answer the phone &amp; have a snack while you\n    read.</li>\n  <li>Restrict TV watching. Let your child earn more by doing a chore, exercising or reading.\n    Track with a chart by the TV.</li>\n  <li>Remind your children that you love them even when they don&#x92;t live up to your\n    expectations. After discipling children, sometimes a note expressing this can be helpful.</li>\n  <li>If they are on the phone too much, set a daily limit &amp; stick to it.</li>\n  <li>Have a written driving agreement with your teenager. The use of a car is a privilege,\n    not a right.

I\ndon&#x92;t like the title, \"The Relaxed Parent\", it gives me a\n\"feeling\" of permissiveness which is not what it is about. It should be called\n\"The Effective Parent\" or \"Principled Parenting\". The other weakness\nof this book is a lack of real life &amp; age appropriate examples of \"Principled\nParenting\". I think this book is a great start, a great foundation to parenting\neffectively (principled parenting) but give me some examples.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/newgen/extra/relaxedbook.htm\">previous page</a> \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n</p>\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"\"The Relaxed Parent\" book review - by Julia Choops","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/newgen/extra/relaxedparentlong.htm"}

On the one\nside, many dedicated people are working to help our nation&#x92;s youth. But on the other\nside, the problems are only worsening -- violence, criminality, discouragement and\nself-destructiveness. Poor and rich kids alike are drifting through childhood without\nfinding the skills and virtues they need to sustain a fruitful life. Commonly accepted\nstandards have fallen tremendously and so have children's skills and behaviors. </p>\n\n<p>There are many misconceptions about the nature of children and their developmental\nneeds, which may lead parents to shield their children from the formative challenges of\nresponsibility and reality. Damon&#x92;s thoughts are a combination of new ideas and\ncommon sense.</p>\n\n<p>He provides numerous statistics and examples of how youth violence, suicide rates,\nteenage pregnancy, and quieter indicators (behavioral problems such as gambling, petty\ntheft, habitual deceitfulness and irregular sleeping hours) are all on the increase.</p>\n\n<p>Damon studied children from impoverished to middle and upper-class families and found\nthat \"as a culture we have come to accept some very dangerous beliefs about raising\nchildren -- beliefs that have given us a generation of poorly educated, apathetic, and\namoral children\" (inside cover). He spends a couple of chapters examining our culture\nand the many misconceptions associated with child-rearing. In particular, he critiques the\noveremphasis of self-esteem, the bonding myth, and the hurried-child myth. He also\ncomments on the derogation of spirituality and the child-centered approach to education.</p>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>\"Sparing children from demanding challenges, and in particular from all\nexpectations of service to others, does them a disservice; because it robs them of\nopportunities to establish their sense of competence and the sense of social\nresponsibility. It imparts to children exactly the wrong pair of messages: (1) that they\nare incapable of accomplishing anything and (2) that they are living only for themselves.\nThe first message belies the child's natural endowment of intelligence, hardiness, and\nenergy. The second goes against the grain of what it means to be a fully developed\nhuman\" (p85). </p>\n\n\n<p>He also provides a framework of guidance for children's intellectual and moral growth.\nHe discusses elements of respectful engagement between parents and children as well as the\nauthoritative, authoritarian, and permissive parenting styles.</p>\n\n<p>In Chapter 8 he expands on parenting and talks about how difficult it is to parent\ntoday. He also discusses discipline and some of the common views today such as power\nassertion and love withdrawal. He then discusses a third strategy called\n\"informational internalization\" or \"induction\" which is worth reading\nand considering.</p>\n\n<p><b>Recommendation:</b> If your goal is to read a \"Christian\" parenting book,\nDamon never provides his specific spiritual beliefs. However, there are many biblical\nprinciples given throughout the book. This is a challenging and scholarly book which I\nhighly recommend reading. I especially recommend reading <b>Chapter 4: Misconceptions of\nModern Times, The Elevation of Self and Derogation of the Spirit</b>. Here he exposes the\nwhole self-esteem movement and shows the need for spiritual growth in children.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/newgen/extra/greaterexplong.htm\">more detailed review</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/newgen/extra/index.htm\">previous page</a></p>\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"\"Greater Expectations\" book review - Laura Bolain","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/newgen/extra/greaterexp.htm"}

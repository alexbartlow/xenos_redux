I would urge everyone who\nis teaching, mentoring or parenting a boy to read this book. For that matter, I would\nrecommend it to women in general so they can better understand their\nhusband/father/brother, and for men so they can better understand themselves. </p>\n\n<p>Kindlon and Thompson (both psychologists) give an overview of the life of boys at\ndifferent stages of growth, backing up their statements with stories from real life: their\nupbringing, how they are treated, how they treat each other, how this influences their\nthinking and behavior, and so on. According to them, the underlying issue to problems\nconcerning boys/men (aggression, loneliness, not being able to relate or get close in\nrelationships, etc) has to do with the fact that they are not taught to develop an\nemotional awareness and vocabulary. The following passage from the book provides a good\ngeneral summary of the authors&#x92; perspective: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"How a boy resolves these three challenges of his emotional life - intimacy, lust,\n  and power - defines the quality of his intimate emotional relationships. Every boy moves\n  toward manhood with his own unique history of emotional experience and education of the\n  heart. There are many boys who are prepared for loving, intimate relationships because\n  they have experienced emotional attachment through a loving relationship with a parent,\n  and perhaps they have seen a good marriage in action in their own parents' relationship.\n  They see it as a doable, believable thing - something they can copy for themselves.\n  Unfortunately, they are not the majority. The majority of boys are not prepared to manage\n  the complexities of a loving relationship because they've been shortchanged on the basic\n  skills of emotional literacy: empathy, conscience, the vocabulary for meaningful emotional\n  expression, and the idea that emotional interdependence is an asset - not a\n  liability.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Recommendation: Even though this book is very insightful, like any book it should\nbe read critically. The main perspective of this book is in harmony with the one\nprescribed to us in the Bible by God, who calls for open, loving, transparent\nrelationships. I have seen this caring, emotionally open quality and its associated impact\namong the men, fathers and sons of our fellowship. Knowing that we are under God's grace\nand acceptance provides a safe environment to live out our emotional side. Whereas the\nauthors relate that happiness can be found through emotional literacy alone, as Christians\nwe recognize that it is our relationship with Christ and His healing forgiveness that\nultimately produce real relational and emotional well-being.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/newgen/extra/index.htm\">previous page</a> \n  \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n</p>\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/classes/newgen/graphics/raisingcain.jpg","title":"\"Raising Cain\" book review - Katrin Aldag","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/newgen/extra/raisingcain.htm"}

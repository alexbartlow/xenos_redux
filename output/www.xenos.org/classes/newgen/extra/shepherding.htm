He bases this goal on the principle in Luke 6\n(the heart as the control center of life). He believes you should help the child to\nunderstand that his/her wrong behavior is a result of a straying heart. Change the heart\nand you will change the behavior.</p>\n\n<p>He writes his book in two parts. Part one describes the goal of parenting, your\nchild&#x92;s development, and unbiblical methods vs. biblical methods. Part two describes\ntraining objectives and training procedures for three age brackets: ages 0-5, 5-12, and\n12-19.</p>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Strengths: \n\n</p><ul>\n  <li>The author speaks against \"Christian determinism\" &#x96; the perspective that\n    a proper environment will produce a proper child. </li>\n  <li>He writes an excellent description of the importance of heart issues rather than just\n    behavior issues. He is teaching against making our kids Pharisees. (Chapters 1-3)</li>\n  <li>Chapter #4 \"You&#x92;re in Charge\" is helpful for a parent who struggles with\n    being an authority for their child.</li>\n  <li>The chapters on communication (chapters 8, 9 &amp; 10) are a good description of how our\n    relationship with our children should be. He calls parents to count the cost of good\n    communication. </li>\n  <li>The training objectives for infancy and childhood are pretty accurate (chapters 15 &amp;\n    16). However, I think his training objectives for teenagers are not as good.</li>\n  <li>His three-pronged tool of diagnosis (pg.168) is a good tool to determine your elementary\n    child&#x92;s needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Weaknesses: \n\n</p><ul>\n  <li>I think his approach in thinking about goals and methods in chapters 5, 6, and 7 are too\n    extreme and dogmatic. I think he is too narrow in his thinking that only communication and\n    the rod is all you need in parenting. I think time-outs, contracts, grounding and rewards\n    can also be effective. He claims these methods are unbiblical.</li>\n  <li>I don&#x92;t believe he allows room for God&#x92;s creativity and individual design of\n    our children. I think he presents a false dichotomy between being a Christian and\n    participating in activities in the world.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Recommendation: </p>\n\n\n<p>Overall I would say the author&#x92;s principle is excellent but his approach is too\nnarrow. I would read it with a critical mind.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/newgen/extra/index.htm\">previous page</a> \n  \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n</p>\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/classes/newgen/graphics/shepherdcover.jpg","title":"\"Shepherding Your Child's Heart\" book review - Cindy Botti","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/newgen/extra/shepherding.htm"}

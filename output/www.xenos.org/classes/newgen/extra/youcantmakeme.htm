It also offers a great deal of practical help on how to motivate them and build\na positive relationship. The practical advice would also work well for very energetic\nkids! </p>\n\n<p>The author is wise to provide a list of characteristics that help to determine whether\nyour child truly is a SWC (Strong Willed Child) or if you clash due to different learning\nstyles (i.e. how you think things should be done). One main characteristic of a SWC is\ntheir need for control and the fact that he/she is willing to suffer any consequence or\npunishment as long as it leaves them in control. Ulrich points out that almost everything\nin our relationship with an SWC - both positive and negative - tends to be more extreme.\nBecause the relationship is more stressed, we need to take great care in putting time into\nbuilding a loving relationship and choosing our battles (because most aren't worth putting\nthe relationship at risk). </p>\n\n<p>It is important to know that SWC's react very negatively to commands and ultimatums -\ngive them room to negotiate. The author also offers much practical advice on how to\nmotivate your SWC to perform in school. As it turns out, the very attributes that get them\ninto trouble at school are the ones that get them hired in the real world: the gift of\ngab, resourcefulness, thinking outside the lines, taking initiative, being independent,\nfiguring out unique angles, using a vivid imagination! </p>\n\n<p>Ulrich issues a strong warning on not being too quick to label these children as\n\"learning disabled,\" but challenges parents and teachers to tap into their\ncreativity and potential. As she points out, SWC's have great potential. Some famous\nexamples are Thomas Edison, Thomas Jefferson, and Albert Einstein. </p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind, however, that all kids are strong willed at certain developmental stages\nof life (ex. 2 1/2 and teens). Ulrich&#x92;s advice works well for these ages - just make\nsure you don't keep an image of your child that does not apply in the long run. Also, she\ndoes not distinguish between aggressive and passive strong will or how temperament plays a\nrole in a child's behavior. </p>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Recommendation: This book is interesting and a fast read with many stories and much\npractical advice. I highly recommend this book. I think parents and teachers will greatly\nbenefit from it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/newgen/extra/index.htm\">previous page</a> \n  \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n</p>\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/classes/newgen/graphics/YouCantMakeMe.jpg","title":"\"YOU CAN'T MAKE ME, but I Can be Persuaded\" book review - Katrin Aldag","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/newgen/extra/youcantmakeme.htm"}

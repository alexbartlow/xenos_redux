(e.g. If the gift of knowledge means knowing things about \n    other&#x92;s lives without them telling you, what is the difference between \n    that and the gift of prophecy? Or the gift of discernment?)</li>\n  <li><u> <b>Integrative reconciliation</b></u> is a process of \n    carefully defining how the new material is the same as or different from existing \n    known materials. (e.g. Explain how spiritual gifts are the same of different \n    than spiritual fruits.)</li>\n  <li><u> <b>Consolidation</b></u> means that there is insistence \n    on mastery of basic knowledge before going on to new items to be learned.</li>\n   \n</ol>\n<p>Using your best guess at what these stages might mean, write \n  a series of questions that would apply these steps to a discussion on \"How \n  to know the will of God\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/discussion/index.htm\" target=\"top\"><strong>Discussion Class Contents</strong></a><br>\n  <strong><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Classes Index Page</a><br>\n  <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Xenos Homepage</a><br>\n  <a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=Group%20Discusssion\">Talk \n  to Dennis</a></strong></p>\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/graphics/navldr.jpg","title":"Leading Discussion, Week 4 Exercise","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/discussion/week4exercise.htm"}

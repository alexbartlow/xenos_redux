Like other methods, this channel has \n  strengths and weaknesses. Compile a list of weaknesses and strengths before \n  going on.</p>\n<b>\n</b><p>Group Discussion Strengths and Weaknesses</p>\n \n\n<p>We will be referring often in this class to <i>Mastering the \n  Techniques of Teaching</i> (Second Edition), Joseph Lowman (San Francisco, Josey-Bass \n  Inc., Publishers, 1995) Lowman is a recognized authority on college-age instruction. \n  All page numbers at ends of citations are from this excellent book.</p>\n<b>\n</b><p>Definition:</p>\n\n \n<h2>Technique</h2>\n<h3>Introduction:</h3>\n<p>Some discussions seem to drag in fits and awkward silences, \n  creating tension in the group that further inhibits discussion. Other discussions \n  seem to thrive in eager sharing, with people actually competing to get their \n  point in. Why is this?</p>\n<p>The most likely reason for such difference is the introduction. \n  In our introduction, we touch on the skills of public speaking, or homiletics. \n  The leader must stimulate and excite the group about the subject under consideration. \n  During this first part ot the meeting, the burden is completely on the leader \n  to:</p>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n      <p>Raise the group's ______________________: Defining what \n        the __________, and why they are _________</p>\n      <p>_______________________ the group with the subject and \n        with the leader</p>\n      <p>Achieve ________: People sit up, furrow their brows, \n        smile, laugh, and in other ways show that they have been _________________, \n        whether excited, disturbed, insulted (be careful with this one), or inspired.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When people come into a meeting, they are not ready to discuss \n  anything. Most people come to meetings with _____________ and _____________. \n  They do not have any thoughts to share, or any desire to speak. Leaders who \n  try to start out with a discussion question are mistaken.</p>\n<p>Achieving such arousal is not necessarily a _______________. \n  It could be accomplished in a couple of minutes, although you could spend up \n  to 15 or even 20 minutes, if the you feel the need to lay a more complete groundwork. \n  These judgments are based on the subject matter and the audience. Longer introductions \n  have the potential to lay out more elaborate content, but may exhaust the audience \n  _________________.</p>\n<p>To become adept at this part, consider taking a class in _____________.</p>\n<h3><b>Probes:</b></h3>\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Patterns:</p>\n  <blockquote> \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p><b>Consider Lowman&#x92;s 6 types of thinking best developed \n  in discussion:</b></p>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Finally, consider these qualifications on leaders&#x92; \n  questions by Lowman:</strong></p>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    \n    \n    \n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The underlying assumption is that as people struggle with concepts \n  and their own thoughts and feelings, they will become very receptive to new \n  information and ideas that help them resolve the questions before them. Research \n  shows that when learners struggle for answers in a area they retain those answers \n  longer and more accurately. Further, when learners discuss related issues under \n  skillful guidance, they link the ideas in an associational network. Such networks \n  are remembered far longer than isolated concepts. 162</p>\n<p>More importantly, such discussion has the potential to develop \n  actual thinking skills that will never result from lecture. While an audience \n  might admire and enjoy a lecturer&#x92;s thinking, we have no reason to believe \n  they would be able to imitate such thinking on their own in situations not mentioned \n  in a lecture. As Lowman observes, \"asking learners to apply in your group \n  what they have learned [through discussion] requires them to demonstrate understanding, \n  not merely memorization.\" 162 This is what we want from our people&#x97;not \n  just the ability to do what a tape-recorder can do (spit back knowledge) but \n  to creatively handle that knowledge in ways that are useful in ministry and \n  Christian living.</p>\n<p>Seen this way, we realize discussion is an essential type of \n  instruction where learners get to try their own wings like baby birds. I believe \n  a guided discussion format is the best approach for many Xenos cell groups, \n  small groups, and home churches to use most of the time. Authorities agree that \n  even in large groups of over 100 a skillful lecturer can incorporate periods \n  of interaction with good effect.</p>\n<p>However, _________ is essential. Many discussions lead nowhere, \n  and any conclusions reached are not memorable.</p>\n<h2>Responses</h2>\n<p>The leader guides the discussion with responses to what people \n  say. The leader normally responds to _______________________ with ______ responses \n  calculated to clarify what is being said while keeping discussion moving forward \n  in the right direction.</p>\n<p>This responding by the leader is a very complicated skill, \n  made more difficult by the immediacy of discussion. Little planning is possible \n  when it comes to offering responses. On the other hand, many aspects of this \n  skill are common to good conversation in general and becomes instinctual after \n  some practice. Consider what the leader must do in order to offer good responses:</p>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When the discussion leader learns to do all these things by \n  habit and instinct, leading discussion becomes an enjoyable and relaxing way \n  to teach. She is able to draw on the gifts and knowledge of fellow Christians \n  in the group for help rather than feeling responsible for a solo performance.</p>\n<p>While not as glorifying to the leader as a blockbuster sermon, \n  a rich discussion will leave members feeling like they contributed, learned, \n  and heard God speak to their hearts. It also helps develop social ties and understanding \n  between members. Viewed this way, we see that leading discussion is one of the \n  most self-effacing modes of teaching.</p>\n<p>Many teachers feel uneasy with guided discussion, and prefer \n  lecture. This could reflect a fear of losing control. The spontaneity and unpredictability \n  of discussion strikes fear into the heart of those who lack confidence in their \n  own knowledge of Scripture, in God&#x92;s leadership of the group, and in the \n  capabilities of fellow leaders. Or, to put it differently, heavy controllers \n  make poor discussion leaders.</p>\n<b>\n</b><p>Background Factors</p>\n \n<p>To maximize the effectiveness of discussion, leaders should \n  realize the importance of a number of background factors.</p>\n<ol>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Discussion is easier when all the students can________________________________. \n      </li>\n    <li>De-emphasize ____________________________ between teacher \n      and students as much as possible: <br>\n      -<br>\n      -<br>\n      - <br>\n      </li>\n    <li>Skillful leaders discourage competition among learners \n      by ________________________________</li>\n    <li>Discussion should not be allowed to _________________________________________</li>\n    <li>Members should be conditioned to participate in discussion______________________. \n      Lowman 178</li>\n    <li>Discussion is especially stimulating for students who \n      ______, but thinking is also stimulated in those who_________________________________________________. \n      163</li>\n  </ol>\n</ol>\n<b>\n</b><p>Potential Strengths</p>\n \n<p>Discussion is uniquely capable of teaching people:<br>\n  -<br>\n  -<br>\n  - </p>\n<p>It also tells the instructor how completely the________________________________.<br>\n  </p>\n<p>Discussion promotes ____________ because __________________________________<br>\n  </p>\n<p>Discussion is particularly good at revealing students&#x92; \n  ___________ <br>\n  </p>\n<p>Lowman says, \"An instructor who, by means of discussion, \n  asks for students&#x92; opinions communicates that he or she cares about their \n  reactions.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Discussion enhances rapport between student and teacher \n  partly because it gives instructors so many chances to show acceptance of student \n  ideas.\" 165 <br>\n  <br>\n  Viewed this way, leading discussion is an opportunity for _______________________________</p>\n<p>According to Lowman, \"Student comments are offered to \n  the instructor in the hope of approval and verification of their academic competence. \n  The quality of the instructor&#x92;s response potently influences both the student \n  offering the comment and those observing the interchange.\" 165</p>\n<p>Discussion leaders are able to _____________ whole groups to<br>\n  <br>\n  ________________________. Members who see themselves as victorious contributors \n  to the <br>\n  <br>\n  group discussion will_____________________________________________________. \n  These <br>\n  <br>\n  can, in turn, become the building blocks of________________________________________.</p>\n<p>It is possible that leading discussion might involve more learned \n  skills than does effective preaching. Good preaching often seems possible for \n  some, but not for others. Leading discussion also draws on the abilities of \n  the group, which in our context, include mature Christians who are ready to \n  help.</p>\n<h2>Potential Weaknesses</h2>\n<p>Teachers who understand, embrace, and practice discussion leading \n  will gain an important tool in their arsenal. Groups led by good discussion \n  leaders tend to be engaged, interested, and enthusiastic. Discussion should \n  not be the only mode of instruction, but it will enhance other modes by supplying \n  what they cannot.<br>\n  <br>\n  1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/index.htm\" target=\"top\"><strong>Discussion Class Contents</strong></a><br>\n  <strong><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Classes Index Page</a><br>\n  <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Xenos Homepage</a><br>\n  <a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=Group%20Discusssion\">Talk \n  to Dennis</a></strong></p>\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Discussion as Instruction: Theory","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/discussion/lecturestudwk1.htm"}

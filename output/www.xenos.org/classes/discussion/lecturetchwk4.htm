The truth is important and should \n            be served up with some feeling--otherwise we are sending mixed signals. \n            \"This is the most important truth in the world, but it doesn't \n            move me to raise my voice.\" </p>\n          <p>- To create feeling, the speaker should actually \n            feel. When we let ourselves feel the urgency of our message, we are \n            said to have a \"burden\" for the material. We develop a burden \n            through prayer and wrestling with accusation and apathy during the \n            days before we teach. This is a good reason to avoid waiting until \n            the day before to prepare. Sometimes, our burden has to be taken on \n            faith, in the sense that we won't actually feel the zeal until we \n            actually step up to speak.</p>\n          <p>- Leader inhibition causes us to want to be \"cool\" \n            when teaching, and not risk being viewed as foolish. While extreme \n            or corny displays would be considered foolish, most of us are in NO \n            DANGER of suffering this fate! Video taping your teaching will confirm \n            that most of us are much more reserved and inhibited than we think.</p>\n          <blockquote> \n            <p>1. <b>Voice</b> - emotion is noticeable in the \n              way we speak. An even, calm tone suggests a lack of emotion. Strong \n              emotional speech is variable -- The tone of our voice should rise \n              and fall in volume and in pitch. Also, emotional speech is generally \n              louder (unless expressing grief or similar). Try going extreme in \n              pitch and volume once in awhile on key points. Learn to throw the \n              hardball, but save it for key points. Also, unusual ways of bending \n              words, speaking with staccato gaps, repetition of phrases, and exaggerated, \n              slow or fast speech all attract waning attention and arouse curiosity. \n              Again, the important thing is not to throw all hardballs, but to \n              vary our approach. Intense fury is most impacting when juxtaposed \n              with happiness, humor, appeals, or sorrow. Throwing any pitch too \n              often becomes either boring, or even annoying.</p>\n            <p>2. <b>Face</b> - Research confirms that much of \n              what we communicate emotionally is transmitted through the face. \n              When teaching, especially a home church or cell, you are easily \n              close enough to people for them to get a good look at your face. \n              Think about people who are emotional. How does their emotional state \n              affect their faces? Faces that are screwed up in agony, faces with \n              huge, happy smiles, faces that are solicitous or sympathetic, faces \n              that are disturbed or suspicious, all help to convey strong pathos. \n              A deadpan face suggest lack of interest and perfunctory discussion, \n              unmoved by the subject. What a terrible mistake to communicate God's \n              word that way!</p>\n            <p>3. <b>Body language</b> - When people are emotional, \n              you can tell from their body language. Unemotional people are stationary, \n              calm, and relaxed. Emotional people become agitated and their body \n              movements become pronounced. The head may begin to bob or jerk with \n              our speech, punctuating phrases. The head may tilt to one side or \n              rear back, as if in refusal. Our hands may gesture furiously, including \n              broad sweeping movements when we are truly upset. Emotional people \n              may bang their fists on the table. They may lean closer to the listener. \n              They may become agitated enough to stand up and pace. They may point \n              their finger directly at the face of the listener. They may act \n              out with their arms what they are talking about. They may wrap their \n              arms around themselves protectively. The possibilities are endless \n              and should be matched appropriately to the situation. Again, wild \n              gesturing and movement can be exciting, but only if limited to key \n              situations and points. If we begin to act this way all the time, \n              it becomes phony and annoying.<br>\n              <br>\n              3. <b>Eyes</b> - Regardless of what emotion we are communicating, \n              speech experts warn us that we must make direct eye-contact with \n              our hearers. Inexperienced speakers often tend to look down at their \n              notes, thus momentarily breaking the rapport they have established \n              with their hearers, and calling attention to the fact that this \n              is a planned teaching, rather than a spontaneous act of communication--exactly \n              what we <i>don't</i> want. Limit looking at your notes as much as \n              possible. Two or three times should be enough for a whole teaching, \n              because you are only checking to see if you left anything out. Inexperienced \n              speakers also tend to stare just over the heads of the audience, \n              or just below them at the floor. This helps the speaker to concentrate \n              without distraction, but either of these would earn an \"F\" \n              in speech class because they both suggest disengagement with the \n              audience. Instead, learn to slide your eyes across the audience \n              from person to person, looking directly into their eyes. </p>\n            <p>4. <b>Group participation</b> - People are generally \n              stimulated when others chime in. People like to interact with their \n              peers and hear others' viewpoints, or ways of expressing the same \n              point. As discussion leaders, we are in a unique position to draw \n              on this avenue for pathos. As discussed earlier, when people begin \n              to discuss, learn to goad them on to further exertion. When someone \n              is emotional in their sharing or comments, be sure to encourage \n              them. </p>\n          </blockquote>\n        </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Leading Discussion, Week 4 Teacher's Notes","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/discussion/lecturetchwk4.htm"}

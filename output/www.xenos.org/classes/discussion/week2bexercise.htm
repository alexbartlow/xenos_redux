The reactions are underlined: </h4>\n<p>12 Beloved, <u>do not be surprised</u> at the fiery ordeal \n  among you, which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange thing \n  were happening to you;</p>\n<p>13 but to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, \n  <u>keep on rejoicing</u>, so that also at the revelation of His glory you may \n  rejoice with exultation.</p>\n<p>14 If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, \n  because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.</p>\n<p>15 Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer, or thief, \n  or evildoer, or a troublesome meddler;</p>\n<p>16 but if anyone suffers as a Christian, he is <u>not to be \n  ashamed</u>, but is to glorify God in this name.</p>\n<p>17 For it is time for judgment to begin with the household \n  of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the outcome for those who \n  do not obey the gospel of God?</p>\n<p>18 And if it is with difficulty that the righteous is saved, \n  what will become of the godless man and the sinner?</p>\n<p>19 Therefore, those also who suffer according to the will of \n  God shall <u>entrust their souls to a faithful Creator</u> in <u>doing what \n  is right</u>.</p>\n<h4> Using these 5 Godly reactions to suffering \n  as your base, devise questions for each that will bring out the full implications \n  and depth for each point. Suggestions: </h4>\n<h4> 1. Think in terms of thesis-antithesis. </h4>\n<h4> 2. Don't make your questions too easy by \n  supplying too much information, or they will seem like recitation. </h4>\n<h4> 3. Start with theological understanding, \n  and then move to application. </h4>\n<h4>Do not be surprised:</h4>\n<h4>Keep on rejoicing:</h4>\n<h4>Do not be ashamed:</h4>\n<h4>Entrust your souls:</h4>\n<h4>Do what is right:</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/discussion/index.htm\" target=\"top\">Discussion Class Table of Contents</a><br>\n  <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Xenos Classes</a><br>\n  <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Return to Xenos</a></p>\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/graphics/navldr.jpg","title":"Exercise","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/discussion/week2bexercise.htm"}

Guided discussion usually involves short sections of lecture \n  to set up a topic or passage with discussion in between. We find that leaders \n  who may not be highly gifted public speakers can still successfully lead group \n  discussion by releasing the gifting of the whole group.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This five week class is based on a textbook by Joseph Lowman, <i>Mastering \n  the Techniques of Teaching</i> (Second Edition), (San Francisco, Josey-Bass \n  Inc., Publishers, 1995)</strong>.<strong> In addition to lecture, the class \n  involves small group worshops each week. Some are based on homework, others \n  are extemporanious. The instructor has 4-5 assistants who each lead one of the \n  work groups during exercises.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The class worksheets are simply the teacher's notes without the content. \n  They take notes to fill in the blanks, which I think, helps them focus their \n  attention. At the end of the five weeks, I give them the entire class handout.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Classes Index Page</a><br>\n  <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Xenos Homepage</a><br>\n  <a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=Group%20Discusssion\">Talk \n  to Dennis</a></strong></p>\n \n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Description","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/discussion/description.htm"}

The teacher should \n  always be on watch for jargon and non-user-friendly language and immediately \n  say, \"Oh so you're saying...\" with appropriate language substituted \n  for the former. Of course, you have to be quick on your feet to translate such \n  language quickly. Also, if a point was made that is too extreme, or unqualified, \n  you may correct it by either adding your own qualifications or balance points, \n  or calling on the sharer to do so. You also have to consider whether to disassociate \n  yourself from what was said.</p>\n<p>Try your hand at these imaginary comments by having one member of the group \n  read each to one of the other members. Then compare other possibilities like \n  before.</p>\n\n<table width=\"50%\" border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <td>Yeah, this reminds me of people who think it's okay to have abortions! \n      I just can't believe that people are willing to murder like that!</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<table width=\"50%\" border=\"1\">\n  <tr> \n    <td>I think you just have to plead the blood when you come under Satanic accusation \n      like that.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<table width=\"50%\" border=\"1\">\n  <tr> \n    <td>The bottom line is, if you want to grow, you've got to get into the means \n      of growth.

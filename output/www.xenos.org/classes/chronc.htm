He says that the Jews would not enter the\n    house so that they would not be defiled for the Passover Supper, which they had not eaten\n    yet. </li>\n  <li>-John 19:31 further states that because it was the Day of Preparation, the Jews wanted\n    to break their victim's legs, hastening their deaths so that they would not defile the\n    Sabbath (the Jewish Sabbath goes from Friday sun-down to Saturday sun-down). This again\n    shows that they were crucified on a Friday. </li>\n  <li>-John also says, in this same verse, that that Sabbath was also a \"High Day.\"\n    This may mean that this Sabbath Supper was also the Passover Supper. If so, Jesus could\n    not have eaten Passover because the Passover Lamb could only be killed in the Temple, and\n    the Priests didn't start the ritual killing of the Lambs until Friday, well after Jesus\n    had been taken into custody. </li>\n  <li>-Thus Matthew, Mark, and Luke say that Jesus ate Passover on the 14th of Nisan and died\n    on Friday, the 15th of Nisan -- prior to the start of the Sabbath which would have been\n    Friday evening. </li>\n  <li>-John agrees that He died on a Friday, but seems to say that Passover would be eaten\n    Friday evening, rather than Thursday. The problem is resolved by the fact that there were\n    two systems in existence at that time for dating days. <ul>\n      <li>a. The ancient dating method which measured a day from morning to morning and </li>\n      <li>b. The official dating method which measured a day from evening to evening. </li>\n    </ul>\n    <ol>\n      <li>The need for keeping this dual system had arisen because thousands of people would come\n        to Jerusalem to have their lambs ritually slain in the Temple. If they only had one day in\n        which to prepare for the Passover, it would have been extremely difficult to have\n        slaughtered all the lambs brought in to be sacrificed. Therefore, they worked on two\n        different time scales. The Northern part of the country went with the old way of dating\n        (starting from morning and going to the following morning). The Southern part of the\n        country followed the official dating method (from evening to evening). Thus, there were\n        two times when lambs were being killed in the Temple for sacrifice.<br>\n        <br>\n        With two calendars in use, it was possible to spread the slaughter procedure over two\n        days. The Galilean worshippers had their lamb killed on Thursday, while the Judeans had\n        theirs killed on Friday. In both cases, the worshippers were eating their lamb on the same\n        evening that it was killed. Thus, the Judeans were technically eating their lamb on\n        Saturday, even though it was only sun-down on Friday by our reckoning.<br>\n        <br>\n        Jesus, who was a Galilean, worked off of the old dating system, and ate Passover Supper on\n        the 14th of Nisan (which for Him was on Thursday). This fact is reflected in the synoptic\n        Gospels. At the same time, according to the official method of dating, He was actually\n        killed on the 14th of Nisan--a fact that is brought out in John. This fact is significant,\n        because the corporate sacrifice of a burnt offering for the whole nation was done at 3\n        p.m. the day of Passover according to the official reckoning. This means that at the very\n        time that Jesus cried out \"tetelestai\" on the cross, the priest's knife slew the\n        Pascal lamb! (see Jn.1:29 &amp; ICor.5:7) </li>\n      <li>Since we have been able to determine that Christ died on Friday, the 14th of Nisan, we\n        can now turn to solunar tables to determine which year(s) we would find the 14th of Nisan\n        falling on a Friday. Remember, Jewish months are not reckoned by the Earth's rotation\n        around the Sun, but by the Moon's rotation around the Earth. We find that the 14th Of\n        Nisan would fall on a Friday in the years 30 and 33 AD In the year 31 AD, Passover was on\n        a Tuesday, and in 32 AD, it was on a Monday. Thus, we find that the death of Christ must\n        have fallen on the 14th of Nisan in either 30 or 33 AD. </li>\n      <li>In order to determine which date is the correct one we turn to Daniel 9:25 ff. According\n        to this prophecy, the Messiah should be expected in the year 33 AD Since either 30 or 33\n        are permissible, we would prefer the 33 date. </li>\n      <li>There is one other piece of data that favors the date of 33 AD This line of reasoning\n        involves the attempted coup that was thwarted at about this time in Rome. The would-be\n        rebel was named Sejanus. He was trying to gradually overthrow the emperor Tiberius. In the\n        midst of his machinations, his plot came to light. Tiberius arrested Sejanus and had him\n        executed. There followed an extremely bloody purge lasting about 2 years, where suspected\n        co-conspirators were tracked down all over the empire and executed. During this period,\n        anyone who was an appointee of Sejanus' was in great danger. One such appointee was\n        Pontius Pilate! Perhaps this explains why the Jewish mob was able to intimidate Pilate\n        into killing Christ with the threat, \"If you release this man, you are no friend of\n        Caesar!\"(Jn.19:12) Historians have for a long time pointed out that this story of\n        Pilate backing down before a Jewish crowd is completely out of harmony with the other\n        descriptions we have of Pilot as a ruthless, brutal, anti-Semitic tyrant. If, however,\n        this incident occurred during the purge of Sejanus' appointees, it is very likely that\n        blackmail of this kind would have been effective.<br>\n        <br>\n        a. The rebellion of Sejanus was found out in the year 31 AD Thus this explanation will\n        work for the 33 date, but not for the 30 date. </li>\n      <li>In conclusion, the Gospels contain a chronological record that is consistent with\n        itself, and the known facts of history. </li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Chronological Study of the Life of Christ","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/chronc.htm"}

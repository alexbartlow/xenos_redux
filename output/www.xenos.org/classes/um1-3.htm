There is nothing wrong with the desire to be a Christian \n  leader (1 Tim. 3:1), but it must be for the right reason. </p>\n<p>Since these qualities describe spiritual maturity, they are \n  helpful in that they describe the character that the Holy Spirit is seeking \n  to produce in all of our lives. Not surprisingly, most of these qualities are \n  prescribed elsewhere in the New Testament for all Christians. If we allow the \n  Holy Spirit to transform us into a man or woman of God, we can be sure that \n  God will put us into the roles of leadership that he has prepared for us. </p>\n<p><b>Optional Discussion:<br>\n  </b>The Holy Spirit uses passages like this to turn up \"blind spots\" \n  in areas so that we will allow him to change us over a period of time. As he \n  convicts you, how should you respond? </p>\n<p><b>Answers include:</b> <br>\n  Acknowledge to him your lack, along with how you see this lack concretely manifesting \n  itself in your life currently. </p>\n<p>Agree that you want him to change you in this area. \n  </p>\n<p>Agree that you cannot change yourself, but that \n  you believe that he can change you in this area, no matter how deeply entrenched \n  it is. </p>\n<p>Ask him to give you practical steps of faith to \n  take. </p>\n<p>Look for those who are strong in this area, observe \n  how they exhibit this quality, and talk with them about how they developed it \n  (Phil 4:9; 1 Cor. 11:1; Heb 13:7).<br>\n  </p>\n<p><b>Regular Discussion:<br>\n  </b>As general roadmaps to what spiritual maturity looks like, these lists of \n  character requirements are directly applicable to our own lives. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li> \n    <p>Why are each of the following character traits \n      important in Christian living and ministry? </p>\n  </li>\n  <li> \n    <p>How can we cooperate with God to supply us \n      with each requirement? </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Above reproach<br>\n  (1 Tim. 3:2; Titus 1:6,7)--<i>anepilempton</i>: unaccusable; <i>anegkleton</i>: \n  unreprovable</b> </p>\n<ul>\n  <li> \n    <p>This is the summation of all other characteristics. \n      </p>\n  </li>\n  <li> \n    <p>Not only the absence of disqualifying factors \n      is in view, but positive things are evident </p>\n  </li>\n  <li> \n    <p>A good reputation spiritually (Acts 6:3; 16:2). \n      </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Husband of one wife<br>\n  (1 Tim. 3:2)--<i>mais gunaikos andros</i>: \"one-woman man\"</b> </p>\n<ul>\n  <li> \n    <p>This probably does not refer to polygamy (which \n      was not common in the Roman empire), but rather that sexual morality is \n      an established life-style. </p>\n  </li>\n  <li> \n    <p>This qualification does not exclude divorcees; \n      present life-style only is in view (as with all of the qualifications). \n      </p>\n  </li>\n  <li> \n    <p>This includes flirting, porno habits, inappropriate \n      \"counseling\" of the opposite sex, etc.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Temperate </b><br>\n  <b>(1 Tim. 3:2)-<i>-nephalion</i>: sober</b> </p>\n<ul>\n  <li> \n    <p>This is the opposite of being mentally and \n      spiritually dense.

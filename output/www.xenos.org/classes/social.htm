The class is taught by authors of the <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/dot.htm\">popular\n        book</a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/dot.htm\" target=\"_top\"> </a>by\n        the same title.</p>\n      <p><b>Science and Christianity</b> - This class and related classes examine\n        a range of issues in the dialogue between secular science and Christianity,\n        specifically the Bible. Taught by those with scientific and theological\n        credentials, the courses examine issues like creation/evolution, bioethics,\n        intellectual history, and epistemology.</p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/schaeffer/index.htm\"><b>Francis Schaeffer: An Introduction to \n        His Apologetics</b></a> - This five-week course explains the Schaeffer's \n        approach to apologetics, evangelism, and philosophy. Emphasis is given \n        to how Schaeffer understood culture and what it takes to be an effective \n        witness for Christ in a \"post-Christian\" era. Integrating Christian \n        faith to all aspects of life was the foundation of Francis and Edith Schaeffer's \n        ministry. This five-week course brings the Schaeffer's passion for cultural \n        relevance, effective evangelism and spiritual integrity together with \n        their example of ministry as a way of life. Fresh application of their \n        thought is applied to being witnesses for Christ in our postmodern times. \n        Participants read <i>The God Who Is There </i>and selections from <i>The \n        Letters of Francis Schaeffer.</i></p>\n      <p><b>Studies in the history of Christianity</b> - Periodic studies in church\n        history and historical theology consider the contributions of others as\n        well as the damage done to the cause of Christ by his followers.</p>\n      \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Classes on Social or Historical Issues","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/social.htm"}

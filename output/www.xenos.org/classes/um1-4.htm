This word can also be translated \"minister.\" \n  Some argue that the deacons administrated the physical needs of the church because \n  of the example of the six men selected in Acts 6:1-6. While the word \"deacon\" \n  is used in vs. 1 (\"ministry\" or \"distribution\"), and the \n  verb form is used in vs. 2, (\"to serve\") the noun form is also used \n  in vs. 4 to refer to the apostles proclamation (\"ministry of the word\"). \n  Therefore, we have no reason to believe that the usage of diakonia in Acts 6 \n  is a technical usage, or that the ministry of the deacon is limited to administration. \n  </p>\n<p>We think of deacons as \"under-shepherds\" who were \n  responsible for shepherding a smaller sphere of the local church or other tasks \n  as assigned, while the elders were responsible for the overall leadership of \n  the church. Deacons appear to be under the authority of the elders. This is \n  evident from the fact that they are always mentioned after the elders, and also \n  because the requirements for deacons are slightly less strict than for elders.</p>\n<p><b>Gender<br>\n  </b>Deacons were both male and female. While some say the \"women\" \n  in 1 Tim. 3:11 are deacons' wives, this seems very unlikely. If Paul was concerned \n  that deacons' wives be dignified so as to avoid reproaching deacons, it is unimaginable \n  that he would not make the same point to the wives of elders. In addition, in \n  Rom. 16:1,2, Paul tells us that Phoebe was a \"deaconess\" of the church \n  in Cenchrea, and that she held a position of considerable influence. </p>\n<p><b>Differences From Elders<br>\n  </b>The qualifications for deacons are very similar to those for elders, but \n  omit certain requirements which are expected of elders. Evidently, deacons could \n  be very young Christians (there is no \"not a new convert\" requirement). \n  However, they were still to be \"tested\" to ascertain that their character \n  and service were genuine and consistent. They do not seem to need as much scriptural \n  knowledge as the elders. They are to \"hold to the mystery of the faith \n  with a clear conscience,\" which stresses obedience to what they know more \n  than a sophisticated knowledge of the Word. They are not required to be able \n  to \"refute those who contradict\" as were elders. </p>\n<b>Qualifications for Deacons<br>\n1 Tim. 3:8-12<br>\n</b>The following qualifications are all of a subjective nature, and therefore \nmust be understood as <i>comparatively </i>true for deacons, never as <i>absolutely \n</i>true. Also, we recognize that this is our particular interpretation, applicable \nto Xenos Fellowship. The English is taken from the NASB.  \n<ol>\n  <li><b>Dignity</b>. \"Likewise\" means the foregoing \n    description regarding elders applies in principle. Dignity speaks of a respectable \n    reputation especially in spiritual matters. </li>\n  <li><b>Not double tongued</b> means not insincere--not saying \n    one thing to one and something different to another. Not a liar. Straight \n    forward. </li>\n  <li><b>Not addicted to much wine</b> means no abuse or dependence \n    on any drug--may include regular use of alcohol even though not getting drunk, \n    if inappropriate dependence is demonstrated. There should be a demonstrated \n    freedom not to drink. </li>\n  <li><b>Not fond of sordid gain</b>. Not willing to manipulate \n    or resort to illegitimate means for personal gain, either for money or recognition, \n    especially in the area of ministry. The person demonstrates a proper values \n    system, including a willingness to give up money making opportunities for \n    the sake of the gospel. This also implies that the deacon should be giving \n    consistently and sacrificially of his/her money. </li>\n  <li><b>Holding fast to the mystery of the faith with a clear \n    conscience</b>. \"Holding fast\" speaks of <i>knowing</i> the Word, \n    and \"clear conscience\" speaks of <i>doing</i> the Word. This includes \n    having a clear conscience with regard to the service being rendered to the \n    church (i.e. sins of omission are also wrong). </li>\n  <li><b>Tested first and beyond reproach</b>. Deacons must have \n    a proven ability to do the work of shepherding and service effectively and \n    without any grounds of accusation. In other words, we don't decide that someone \n    is a deacon, we recognize that someone already is a deacon. </li>\n  <li><b>Not malicious gossips</b>. They demonstrate care not to \n    exaggerate or to abusively speak of others. This implies the ability to keep \n    a secret where appropriate. If the failings of others are shared, it is only \n    with those in a responsible position and for proper reasons. </li>\n  <li><b>Temperate</b> comes from a word meaning serious, not given \n    to excess, self-controlled and emotionally stable. </li>\n  <li><b>Faithful in all things</b> indicates reliability. It implies \n    that we don't have to worry when this person is given a job to do--the deacon \n    will do his/her best. </li>\n  <li><b>Husband of one wife</b>. Literally a \"one-woman man,\" \n    this means specifically that there is at most one person of the other sex \n    in the deacon's life. It means in principle that the deacon has his/her sexuality \n    resolved and under control. </li>\n  <li><b>One who manages his own household well</b>. The primary \n    application is to married men meaning that their family life is good. In the \n    case of the unmarried, it means that they have close relationships and that \n    those relationships are generally healthy and stable. A pattern of broken \n    relationships suggests an inability to get along with others (especially your \n    own family and friends) and disqualifies a would-be deacon</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><big><a href=\"mailto:webmaster@xenos.org\">Ask \n  Dennis a question or share a comment.</a> <br>\n  <a href=\"mailto:DeLashmuttG@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Ask Gary a question \n  or share a comment.</a> <br>\n  <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/und_min.htm\">Return to Understanding Ministry Table of Contents</a> \n  <br>\n  <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/index.htm\">Return to the Xenos Courses Page</a> <br>\n  <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to Xenos Home Page</a> <br>\n  <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/um2-1.htm\">Read on to the next section in Understanding Ministry</a> \n  </big></p>\n \n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Qualifications for Deacons","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/um1-4.htm"}

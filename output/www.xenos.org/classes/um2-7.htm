This is accomplished through the exchange of God's love and truth, which\nis called \"ministry\" (which simply means \"service\"). </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Koinonia is viewed by the New Testament as a non-optional environment for\nspiritual growth. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Clearly such koinonia is not just a matter of attending one or two meetings a\nweek. It is much more than that. This is why the verse so often used to stress the\nimportance of attending church (Hebrews 10:25 \". . .not forsaking the assembling\ntogether as is the habit of some. . .\"), is frequently misunderstood today. This\nverse is often taken to mean that only our presence at church meetings is necessary.\nInstead, we find that according to 1 Cor. 12:21 (\". . .the eye cannot say to the\nhand, `I have no need of you'. . .\"), it is not just the presence of the other\nmembers that we need, but also their function. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Christians are viewed as the body of Christ because we are spiritually united with\nChrist and with each other. Since we are members of one another, we need to relate to each\nother in a mutually interdependent way. The important point, therefore, is not just that\nwe attend meetings (although this is a necessary aspect), but that we authentically share\nthe life of Christ with one another. Thus, \". . . speaking the truth in love, we are\nto grow up in all aspects into Him who is the Head, even Christ, from whom the whole body,\nbeing fitted and held together by that which every joint supplies, according to the proper\nworking of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of\nitself in love.\" (Eph. 4:15,16). </big></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><big>How can we practice koinonia?</big></h3>\n\n<p><big>The New Testament defines normative involvement in Christian koinonia in two major\nways. One way is by serving other Christians with our spiritual gifts and receiving\nothers' service through their spiritual gifts. The sphere in which we use our gifts is our\nministry, or service. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Another, and perhaps more basic way to practice koinonia is through loving one\nanother in various practical ways. In Jn. 13:34,35, Jesus told his disciples that they\nwere to \"love one another as I have loved you.\" Since they had been with Jesus\nfor several years, they knew how he expressed love to them. Since other Christians would\nnot have this opportunity, the apostles carefully described what this love looks like.\nThrough what are sometimes called the \"one another\" imperatives of the epistles,\nwe are given a profile of the ways that we can love one another. Below are examples: </big>\n\n</p><ul>\n  <li><big>Encourage one another (1 Thess. 5:11; Heb. 3:13; 10:25) </big></li>\n  <li><big>Admonish one another (Col. 3:16; Rom. 15:14) </big></li>\n  <li><big>Confess your sins to one another (Jas. 5:16) </big></li>\n  <li><big>Forgive one another (Eph. 4:32; Col. 3:13) </big></li>\n  <li><big>Accept one another (Rom. 14:1; 15:7) </big></li>\n  <li><big>Serve one another (Gal. 5:13; Rom. 12:10) </big></li>\n  <li><big>Build up one another (1 Thess. 5:11) </big></li>\n  <li><big>Be hospitable to one another (1 Pet. 4:9) </big></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><big>As we practice giving love to other Christians in these ways, and as we allow them\nto express love to us in these ways, we are practicing koinonia and expressing mutual\ninterdependence as members of Christ and one another. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Christian meetings are important in this regard because they enable us to\nexperience koinonia during the meeting in varying degrees. They also facilitate the\nmeeting of other Christians with whom we can build koinonia-based friendships. New\nTestament churches commonly met in homes as well as in large groups (see Acts 2:46; 20:20;\nRom. 16:5). </big></p>\n\n<p><big>The reason for this was probably so that the Christians could more easily practice\nthis kind of koinonia. Xenos has always emphasized the importance of home groups for this\nreason. In the context of a home group and the relationships which develop between\nmembers, a level of koinonia can occur which is impossible by attending only larger\nmeetings. </big></p>\n\n\n\n<p><big><a href=\"mailto:DeLashmuttG@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Ask Gary a question\nor share a comment.</a> <br>\n<a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=koinonia\">Ask Dennis a question or share a\ncomment.</a> <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to Xenos Home Page</a> <br>\n  <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/homegroups/index.htm\">Return to Home Group Ministries</a> <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/und_min.htm\">Return to Understanding Ministry Table of Contents</a> <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/um2-8.htm\">Read on to the next section in Understanding Ministry</a>  </big></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Understanding Ministry: Koinonia","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/um2-7.htm"}

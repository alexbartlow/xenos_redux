We are using \n          this term, \"discipleship\" in a way different than the bible \n          uses it. The bible does not talk about workers having disciples, but \n          rather people being disciples of Christ. It doesn’t make it wrong \n          for us to use it referring to people we are discipling, but we are on \n      safer ground just demonstrating the work of discipleship.</h4>\n      <dir> \n      <h4>Jesus’ example: Mark 3:13-15 (Coleman). We see Christ being \n      with them and sending them out.</h4>\n      <h4>Jesus’ command: Matthew 28:19-20 – we are teaching others \n            to be disciples of CHRIST, not us. Teaching them to observe what Christ \n      teaches, not us. The central imperative is \"make disciples\".</h4>\n      <h4>Paul’s example: Colossians 1:28,29; 1 Timothy. 1:2 &amp; 2 \n            Timothy 1:2; Titus 1:4 (30 other disciples mentioned) We could probably \n            argue that this is most important ministry (note the strong language \n            in Col. 1). Note also the language he uses to describe Timothy – \n        \"beloved son\" does not likely mean he led Timothy to Christ, \n      but that he trained or mentored him. Likewise also with Titus.</h4>\n      <h4>Paul’s command: 2 Timothy 2:2</h4>\n      </dir>\n      <h4><b>Why is this so important?</b></h4>\n      <dir><b> </b> \n      <h4>There were two great preachers in England in the 1800’s.

Discipleship. \n            He was committed to discipling the people he led to Christ so that \n            they would be able to do the same. This led Whitefield to say toward \n      the end of his career that he had woven a \"rope of sand\".</h4>\n      <h4>We see quality over quantity, core over crowd, cell over program. \n      Yet it leads to far greater quantity.</h4>\n      <h4>In other words, we are comparing addition versus multiplication \n            growth. One person reaching 100 people for Christ every year but not \n            teaching them how to do the same, versus one person reaching one person \n      for Christ every other year, but also discipling them to do the same.</h4>\n      <dir> \n      <h4>In 50 years, the 1<sup>st</sup> has reached 5,000 people for Christ. \n      And, his outreach ministry ends when he dies.</h4>\n      <h4>In the same 50 years, the 2<sup>nd</sup> has effectively reached \n      16,777,216 people.</h4>\n      <h4>QUALIFICATION: We are NOT saying that this exact progression will \n              or should be seen – the evil one would have a hay-day with \n              that interpretation and has in our church.

It is possible to be very \n        gifted and knowledgeable, yet immature or carnal. Immature people often \n        get into leadership, where they do the church much harm (see Diotrophes \n        3 Jn. 9). There is nothing wrong with the desire to be a Christian leader \n        (1 Tim. 3:1), but it must be for the right reason. </p>\n      <p>Since these qualities \n        describe spiritual maturity, they are helpful in that they describe the \n        character that the Holy Spirit is seeking to produce in all of our lives. \n        Not surprisingly, most of these qualities are prescribed elsewhere in \n        the New Testament for all Christians. If we allow the Holy Spirit to transform \n        us into a man or woman of God, we can be sure that God will put us into \n        the roles of leadership that he has prepared for us. </p>\n      <p><b>Optional \n        Discussion:<br>\n        </b>The Holy \n        Spirit uses passages like this to turn up \"blind spots\" in areas \n        so that we will allow him to change us over a period of time.

Instead, it apparently described \n        any extent of locality under discussion.<br>\n        Therefore, in answer to the question, \"What constitutes a local church?\" \n        the scriptural answer is that <b>any part of the universal church which \n        is somehow local can be said to be a local church.</b> We would suggest \n        this holds even down to the level where \". . . two or three have \n        gathered together in my name. . . \" (Mt. l8:20) This seems to be \n        Christ's version of what is necessary to have a local church. <br>\n        <br>\n        A church of two or three may not be a very good church in that it is not \n        able to fulfill all of the functions that are appropriate for a local \n        church according to the New Testament, but this does not mean that it \n        is not a church. A distinction must be made between that which determines \n        the \"being\" of the church versus the \"well-being\" \n        of the church. \n      </p><dl> \n        <dt>The local church \n          in the New Testament.<br>\n          While the definition of the local church is based upon our understanding \n          of the universal church, the imperative passages about church life usually \n          refer to the local church (i.e., Rom. l2, 1 Cor. l2,l4; Eph. 4).<br>\n          The significance of this is that if we try to apply principles like \n          the inter-working of the members of the body as taught in 1 Cor. 12 \n          to the universal church, we move away from the intention of the author \n          to focus on the interaction of members on each other in Christian community.<br>\n          Likewise, no structure or polity is given for the universal church except \n          the unifying influence of the apostles who planted the local churches. \n          There is also an example of a council of leaders from more than one \n          local church meeting to resolve differences in Acts 15. We cannot say \n          what the biblical pattern of extra-local church government was, since \n          it is not given.</dt>\n        <dt><br>\n          <b>Optional discussion<br>\n          </b>It is customary in many \n          theologies to construct a restrictive definition of what constitutes \n          a local church. Sometimes several conditions, such as the proper observation \n          of the sacraments, the presence of duly established clergy, a formal \n          government, and ministry to all ages are given before a group can be \n          called a church. What might be the motive for constructing such added \n          conditions? </dt>\n        <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/servanthood1/localchurch.htm#top\">Back \n          to top.</a> <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/servanthood1/leadership.htm\">Next in Understanding Ministry&gt;</a></p>\n      </dl>\n      \n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/classes_hands.jpg","title":"Servanthood 1, the Local Church","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/servanthood1/localchurch.htm"}

Even today, this is the \n        prominent view of leadership's role in the church.</p>\n      <p>Consider the following \n        quotes by leaders and theologians: \n      </p><ul>\n        <li>\". . .both \n          the clergy and the laity have leadership roles, but they are different \n          roles. The clergy are primarily responsible for the assembled phase \n          of the church life. They are called and trained as professionals to \n          preach, to lead worship, to educate. . ., to provide. . .theological \n          counsel, and to lead the congregation's organizational and fellowship \n          life. . .\"</li>\n        <li>\"Lay leadership \n          in these areas is important, but it is secondary and supportive.\"</li>\n        <li>\"(A corporate \n          executive who) realizes that it is the Holy Spirit who has made him \n          head of the research division in a large corporation.\"</li>\n        <li>\"(The hospital \n          elevator operator) who exercises his ministry by humming a hymn by taking \n          the patient's up to the operating room.\" (All from Wentz, <i>Ministry \n          As a Way of Life</i>)</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>Without the comma, \n        everything changes. The leaders equip the believers to do the work of \n        ministry and <b>they</b> build up the body of Christ. In other words, \n        all Christians are ministers with significant spiritual roles to play. \n        </p>\n      <p>The leaders' primary \n        job is not to do it all, but to equip the \"laymen\" to minister. \n        They are to train them in doctrine and ministry, help them to find their \n        unique ministry roles, provide structures in which they can play these \n        roles - and then let them minister!!</p>\n      <p><b>Which interpretation is correct?<br>\n        </b>Without any doubt, the latter is the correct interpretation. \n        For what are the saints being equipped, if not to do the work of ministry?</p>\n      <p>Vs. 7,8 make it clear \n        that every Christian is spiritually gifted. Such gifting is given in order \n        to perform spiritual ministry (1 Corinthians 12:4-6).</p>\n      <p>Vs. 16 sums up the \n        teaching of this passage by saying that the church is built up by that \n        which <i>every joint supplies</i>, according to the proper working of \n        <i>each individual part</i>.</p>\n      <p>Many other passages \n        in the New Testament teach that all Christians are gifted and called to \n        ministry (cf. Romans 12:6-8; 1 Corinthians 12:4-11; 1 Peter 4:10,11).</p>\n      <p>This is one of the \n        crucial distinctives of Xenos. The spiritual fruitfulness and vitality \n        that we enjoy is due in large part to the fact that the leadership is \n        committed to equipping the people for effective needed and often sophisticated \n        ministry. Not only does far more spiritual work get done when everyone \n        does it, but people are far more spiritually healthy when they are ministering. \n        </p>\n      <p><b>Discussion<br>\n        </b>Has anyone ever been in a church where no effort was made to \n        equip people for ministry? What was that like, compared to a church where \n        this is a goal?</p>\n      <p>What happens to Christians \n        who don't understand they are supposed to minister? \n      </p><dl> \n        <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/servanthood1/equippers.htm#top\">Back \n          to top.</a> <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/servanthood1/discipleship.htm\">Next in Understanding Ministry&gt;</a></p>\n      </dl>\n      \n    </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Servanthood 1, Leaders as Equippers","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/servanthood1/equippers.htm"}

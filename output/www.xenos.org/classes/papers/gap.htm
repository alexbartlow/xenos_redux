For example, the promise of a \"son\" and a \"house\"\nto David (II Sam. 7) is fulfilled in his son Solomon, but not wholly. The full effect of\nthe promise is not realized until the \"Son of Man\" and his kingdom.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Four classes of double reference</h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Four different kinds of double references can be distinguished in Scripture: </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">A. Type</h5>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">In the case of a type, or a typical prediction, the seer's eyes are fixed on the closer\nof the two events exclusively. In other words, details of the prophecy are completely\nsatisfied by the earlier event or person. Yet scripture states (either in the original\npassage or elsewhere) that there is also a subsequent event or person foreshadowed by the\nprediction. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">EXAMPLES: Dan. 8:17-26; Jer. 31:15 (see Mt. 2:17,18) </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">B. Gap</h5>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">When the prophet predicts one event or person, followed without notice by a reference\nto a later event or person, it constitutes a \"prophetic gap\". It should be\nnoticed in this case, that the predictive material referring to the later event will not\nfit the earlier event. Neither will the description of the earlier event fit the later\nevent. There are very few pure gap prophecies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">EXAMPLES: Is. 11:1-5; Is. 61:1,2 (see Lk.4:17-21); Dan. 2:40-44; Dan. 7: 7-12 </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">C. Type-Gap</h5>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Often, type and gap are combined. In this case, the prediction of the earlier event or\nperson is typical of the later, but the description of the later event or person does not\nfit the earlier very well. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">EXAMPLES: Is. 13; Dan. 11:20-45; Joel </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">D. Unforeseen Partial</h5>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">In the final kind of double reference, the prophet's focus is exclusively on the later\nevent. Later, it is revealed by scripture that there is also an earlier event which,\nalthough unforeseen, is a real, but incomplete fulfillment of the prophecy. Frequently,\nthe unforeseen event concerns the Church Age, which was not clearly revealed to the Old\nTestament prophets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">EXAMPLES: Joel 2:28-32 (see Acts 2:16-21); Jer. 31:31-34 (see Heb. 8:8-13;10:16-18)</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/outlines.htm\">Return to the Outlines page</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to the Xenos home page</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=biblical%20prophecy%2Cwebmaster@xenos.org\">Ask\nDennis a question or share a comment.</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"mailto:DeLashmuttG@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=biblical%20prophecy%2Cwebmaster@xenos.org\">Ask\nGary a question or share a comment.</a> <br>\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n</p>\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Double Reference in Biblical Prophecy","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/papers/gap.htm"}

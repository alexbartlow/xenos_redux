Growth is never a matter of mere individual pursuit of God. It is\nalways pictured as something we pursue as a community. The importance of fellowship for\ngrowth is seen, not just in experience, but in the pages of the Bible, as the following\nchart shows. </p>\n\n<table border=\"5\" cellpadding=\"4\" width=\"100%\">\n  <tr>\n    <th width=\"50%\" class=\"style1\">Fellowship as a means of growth</th>\n    <td width=\"50%\" class=\"style1\"><br>    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"50%\" class=\"style1\">I&#xA0;Corinthians&#xA0; 12:21 And the eye cannot say to the hand, \"I\n    have no need of you\"; or again the head to the feet, \"I have no need of\n    you.\"</td>\n    <td width=\"50%\" class=\"style1\">No Christian can claim he or she doesn't need ministry from and to other\n    believers. The context of this statement makes it clear that we have all been given gifts\n    for the edification of others. By implication, if we cannot say we don't need them, they\n    cannot say they don't need us! Notice that it is not just the <i>presence </i>of the other\n    members that we need but also their <i>function.</i></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"50%\" class=\"style1\">I&#xA0;Corinthians&#xA0;12:7,14 But to each one is given the manifestation\n    of the Spirit for the common good&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. For the body is not one member, but\n    many.</td>\n    <td width=\"50%\" class=\"style1\">Our gifts are for the common good, i.e., for the good of others. Because\n    we are a part, and not the whole, of the Body of Christ, we need what the other parts of\n    the Body supply. God has not gifted any of us so much that we can meet all our own needs. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"50%\" class=\"style1\">I&#xA0;Corinthians&#xA0;14:26 What is the outcome then, brethren? When you\n    assemble, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an\n    interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.</td>\n    <td width=\"50%\" class=\"style1\">Our times of assembly together are for mutual edification. Whatever you\n    believe about spiritual gifts, there can be no doubt that our meetings are for this\n    purpose. Therefore, if we fail to assemble, we will miss out on edification.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"50%\" class=\"style1\">Ephesians&#xA0;4:15 . . . speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in\n    all aspects into Him who is the Head, even Christ&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;..</td>\n    <td width=\"50%\" class=\"style1\">The Body of Christ should be seen as an organic union based on genuine\n    personal relationships and mutual interdependence. Within these relationships we have the\n    opportunity to speak the truth in love. The important point is not just that we attend\n    meetings (although this is a necessary aspect) but that we authentically share the life of\n    Christ with one another. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"50%\" class=\"style1\">Hebrews&#xA0;10:,24,25 Let us consider how to stimulate one another to\n    love and good deeds, not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some,\n    but encouraging one another; and all the more, as you see the day drawing near.</td>\n    <td width=\"50%\" class=\"style1\">It is in the context of loving relationships that we can learn to\n    stimulate each other to love and good deeds. Devoting time to our meetings is an essential\n    part of this scenario.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"50%\" class=\"style1\">Acts&#xA0;2:42,46 And they were continually devoting themselves to the\n    apostles' teaching and to fellowship [<i>Koinonea</i>], to the breaking of bread and to\n    prayer&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. And day by day continuing with one mind in the temple, and\n    breaking bread from house to house, they were taking their meals together with gladness\n    and sincerity of heart&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.</td>\n    <td width=\"50%\" class=\"style1\">The example of the early church included extensive involvement in\n    fellowship. This fellowship included both meetings (held at Solomon's portico, which was\n    part of the temple, or in homes) and informal times of social and spiritual relationship\n    building. Their involvement was more or less daily according to this passage. Real <i>koinonea</i>\n    means not just attendance at a meeting or two, but successfully building supportive\n    relationships.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"50%\" class=\"style1\">Romans&#xA0;12:4-6a For just as we have many members in one body and all\n    the members do not have the same function, so we, who are many, are one body in Christ,\n    and individually members one of another. And since we have gifts that differ according to\n    the grace given to us, let each exercise them accordingly&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.</td>\n    <td width=\"50%\" class=\"style1\">Our identity in Christ includes the aspect that we are also\n    \"individually members of one another.\" This organic, spiritual, or mystical\n    union of believers with Christ and each other is a sacred thing, which should affect our\n    daily lives. We cannot ignore our union with other believers and still live out our new\n    identity in Christ.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"50%\" class=\"style1\">Matt.&#xA0;18:19,20 Again I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth\n    about anything that they may ask, it shall be done for them by My Father who is in heaven.\n    For where two or three have gathered together in My name, there I am in their midst.</td>\n    <td width=\"50%\" class=\"style1\">In this passage, Christ puts special emphasis on his presence during times\n    of Christian fellowship. It may be that some prayers will not be answered until we pray\n    \"Our Father,\" rather than \"My Father.\"</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"50%\" class=\"style1\">I&#xA0;Corinthians&#xA0;12:18 But now God has placed the members, each one\n    of them, in the body, just as He desired.</td>\n    <td width=\"50%\" class=\"style1\">The Body of Christ is constituted by God, not by man. A local\n    manifestation of the Body of Christ can take different forms. One of these is an\n    incorporated church. Whether a group is incorporated as a church or not, God recognizes\n    all those who are united with Christ as members of his Body.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/charts.htm\">Back to the Charts page</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/wiv.htm\">Back to the Walking In Victory page</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Ask\nDennis a question or share a comment.</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Fellowship as a Means of Growth","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/papers/bodycht.htm"}

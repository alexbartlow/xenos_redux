from <i>galal</i> - to roll up * </p>\n\n<p>The five megilloth are: Ruth, Canticles (Song of Solomon), <i>Ecclesiastes</i>,\nLamentations and Esther. </p>\n\n<p><b>Midrash</b> * </p>\n\n<p>Heb. - <i>midras</i>, \"to seek, examine,\ninvestigate\" * </p>\n\n<p>Refers both to a method of exposition and application of\nthe Torah as well as a collection of these expositions and applications. * </p>\n\n<p>Ezra practiced this style b/c of his efforts to study and\napply the Torah * </p>\n\n<p><i>Haggadah midras</i> - interpreted non-legal materials in\nan ethical and expository style; a distillation of principles from the Torah. * </p>\n\n<p><i>Halakah midras</i> - applied the general principles of\nOT laws to specific situations; an application of the Torah in a kind of 'case law'\nformat. * </p>\n\n<p>Midrash material was preserved orally for a long time * </p>\n\n<p>AD 100's the halakic midrashim were written down * </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Mekilta - treatise to Exodus * </p>\n  <p>Sifra - treatise to Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy * </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>AD 200's the haggadic midrashim were written down * </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Treatise on Genesis followed later by Exodus, Leviticus,\n  Numbers and Deuteronomy as well as the Megilloth * </p>\n  <p>These were known as the Midrash Rabbah </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Mishnah</b> * </p>\n\n<p>From Hebrew s<i>hana</i>, \"to repeat\" * </p>\n\n<p>Refers both to a teaching technique emphasizing memory work\nthrough continuous repetition and a commentary on the Torah that contained few direct\nreferences to the Torah. * </p>\n\n<p>Developed by the scribal school of the Hasidim * </p>\n\n<p>Midrash study was not supplanted by the Mishnah\napproach...both were used for halakic and haggadic areas * </p>\n\n<p>The Mishnah is a sort of collection of the works of\nSopherim, Hasidim, Zugot and Tannaim periods assembled and written down by Judah HaNasi c.\nAD 200. * </p>\n\n<p>Judah HaNasi did not compile all the Mishnah or Midrash\nmaterial into the document called the Mishnah * </p>\n\n<p>Subsequent scholars pulled together the unpublished Mishnah\nand Midrash material with their own commentaries in a document called the Gemara (Aramaic <i>gemara</i>\nmeaning \"completion\") which serves as a commentary on the Judah HaNasi Mishnah *\n</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara and Mishnah is together called the Targum or\nTalmud </p>\n\n<p><b>Scribes</b> * </p>\n\n<p><i>sopherim</i> - scribal tradition running from Ezra\n(c.450 BC to 180 BC) which produced the Midrashim * </p>\n\n<p><i>hasidim</i> - scribal tradition running through the\nMaccabean age which produced the Mishnah * </p>\n\n<p>through the period of the hasidim, there were 5 pairs of\nleaders known as the <i>Zugot</i> who developed instructional methods w/o direct reference\nto the Law </p>\n\n<p><b>Septuagint </b>(abbreviated LXX meaning 'of the\nseventy') * </p>\n\n<p>The name derives from the apocryphal story found in a 2nd\ncentury BC letter, <i>Letter of Aristeas</i>, who claimed it was the work of 72 scholars,\n6 from each tribe of Israel. * </p>\n\n<p>A Greek translation of the Torah prepared 3 centuries\nbefore the birth of Christ </p>\n\n<p><b>Talmud</b> * </p>\n\n<p>From <i>lamad</i>, \"to study,\" \"to\nlearn\" * </p>\n\n<p>An interpretation of the Law and a collection of wise\nsayings; * </p>\n\n<p>Developed in Alexandria after Babylon and Jerusalem were no\nlonger Jewish intellectual centers; comprised of the Jerusalem and Babylonian Targum with\nadditional commentaries * </p>\n\n<p>Talmud is sometimes used interchangeably with Targum * </p>\n\n<p>Circa 450 BC to AD 500 * </p>\n\n<p>See the notes on Mishnah, Midrash and Targum </p>\n\n<p><b>Targum</b> * </p>\n\n<p>from <i>targumim</i>, interpretations * </p>\n\n<p>Interpretations or paraphrases of the Pentateuch * </p>\n\n<p>The Gemara and Mishnah is together called the Targum or\nTalmud * </p>\n\n<p>There are two versions of the Targum: the Jerusalem (aka\nJonathan, AD 425) and the Babylonian (AD 500); the latter is 3x as long </p>\n\n<p><a name=\"Literary%20Structure\"><b>Literary Structure</b> </a></p>\n\n<p>Often OT prophets delivered their message in verse. This\nmade the message more interesting and easier to remember. Below are some terms used to\ndescribe attributes of these styles: </p>\n\n<p><b>Acrostic Poetry</b> </p>\n\n<p>The first letter of each new line forms a recognizable\npattern (e.g. Ps.119, each new line begins with a letter of the Hebrew alphabet; see also\nPs.9/10,25,34,37,111,112,145). </p>\n\n<p><b>Alliteration </b></p>\n\n<p>Repetition of the same sound at the beginning of two or\nmore words in a series (e.g. \"Fields ever fresh and groves ever green\").\nObviously, this style is only present in the language in which the text was initially\nwritten. Once translated, the impact of alliteration is lost. Ps.22:4 <i>beka batehu...\nbatehu</i> ('in you...put their trust; they trusted) </p>\n\n<p><b>Allegory</b> </p>\n\n<p>An allegory is a sort of extended metaphor where two\ndifferent things are being compared for their similarities in an effort to clarify\nsomething about the object of the allegory. In an allegory, each element of an account\nrepresents a feature of the object of the allegory. \"Thus says the Lord my God,\n'Pasture the flock doomed to slaughter. Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished,\nand each of those who sell them says, 'Blessed be the Lord, for I have become rich.' And\ntheir own shepherds have no pity on them'\" is an allegory from Zechariah.11:4. The\nobjects of this allegory are those who participate in the destruction of Israel...that\nthey treat Israel like a sheep herd and each element of the allegory directly applies to\nthese people. </p>\n\n<p><b>Antiphony </b></p>\n\n<p>An antiphonal psalm is a responsive psalm. The cantor\nrecites a line and the group responds (e.g. the great Hallel, Psalm 136) </p>\n\n<p><b>Aphorism </b></p>\n\n<p>A short pithy sentence (e.g. he's as good as dead). In\nIsaiah 7:8, \"The head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is only\nRezin.\" </p>\n\n<p><b>Apostrophe </b></p>\n\n<p>An address directed toward a personification (e.g.\nPs.68:15-16). </p>\n\n<p><b>Assonance </b></p>\n\n<p>A partial rhyme in which the stressed vowel sounds are\nalike but the consonant sounds are not (e.g. bike and light). In Micah 7:4 the word hedge,\n<i>mesuka,</i> and the word confusion, <i>mebuka</i> are assonant words used to change\nperspective from description to prediction. Isaiah describes the day of the Lord as a day\nof tumult, <i>mehuma</i>, trampling, <i>mebusa</i> and terror, <i>mebuka</i> (22:5) using\nassonance &amp; alliteration to make the prophecy tense and memorable to his listeners.\nAccording to VanGemeren,<sup><a name=\"Ref1\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/ancscrip.htm#Note1\">[1]</a></sup>&#xA0; Psalm\n44:7 displays assonance. Although he focuses upon the consonant sounds, sh, ts or s, which\noccur in every word: <i>hosatanu missarenu umesanenu hebisota.</i> </p>\n\n<p><b>Chiasm </b>(a.k.a. chiasmus) </p>\n\n<p>An inversion of the second of two parallel phrases (e.g. do\nnot live to eat but eat to live). Isaiah 1:19-20, \"you will eat the best...but if you\nresist, you will be devoured,\" carries the chaismus, 'eat or be eaten.' Psalm 51:1a,\n'have mercy...according to your love' forms a chiasm with 51:1b, 'according to your\ncompassion...blot out transgressions'. Psalm 6:9a, 'heard...my cry for mercy' forms a\nchiasm with 6:9b, 'my prayer...accepts'. </p>\n\n<p><b>Ellipsis</b> </p>\n\n<p>This involves incomplete parallelism. The second phase in a\nparallel line silently includes a clause from the previous line (e.g. Ps.88:6). Psalm\n12:3, 'may the Lord cut off' belongs with both clauses but is only associated with the\nfirst clause. </p>\n\n<p><b>Hendiadys </b></p>\n\n<p>A figure of speech wherein two sequential expressions\nmake the same point (Ps.107:10 - darkness {<i>hosek</i>} and deepest gloom {<i>salmawet</i>}\nintensify the experience of anguish) OR (Ps.27:1 'the Lord is my light {<i>'or</i>} and my\nsalvation {<i>yesa</i>} intensify the joy of God's loving actions). </p>\n\n<p><b>Hyperbole </b></p>\n\n<p>An exaggeration meant to emphasize a point rather than\nto be taken literally (e.g. The whole world is in an uproar over this teaching. This is as\nold as time) (e.g. Ps.40:12). Some people take \"the lion shall lie down with the lamb\n...\" prophecy in Isaiah 11:3-16 to be an hyperbole intended to emphasize the peace\nand safety of the millennial kingdom. Others take it literally. </p>\n\n<p><b>Imagery </b></p>\n\n<p>The use of simile, metaphor mythic allusions or other\nliterary devices that conjure up mental images as they are read and pondered. Parallelism\nand imagery are standard features of Hebrew poetry. Meter and rhyme, while important in\nWestern poetry, are not characteristic of Hebrew poetry </p>\n\n<p><b>Inclusion</b> (a.k.a. inclusio) </p>\n\n<p>The opening and closing of a passage is the same or\nsimilar. Inclusio serves as bookends to the entire passage between. It sets the mood for\nthe passage and brings it to a close (e.g. Ps. 8:1 &amp; 9; <i>Hallelu Yah</i>, <i>Praise\nYaweh</i> begins and ends Ps.106).<sup><a name=\"Ref2\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/ancscrip.htm#Note2\">[2]</a></sup>\n&#xA0; </p>\n\n<p><b>Merismus </b></p>\n\n<p>A use of words that are meant to represent the whole\npopulation (e.g. Ps.105:14 <i>adam</i> (man) and <i>melakim</i> (kings) are used to mean\nanyone/everyone). Ps. 121:2 'heaven &amp; earth' are meant to represent every created\nthing. </p>\n\n<p><b>Metaphor</b> </p>\n\n<p>When unlike things are compared with each other to clarify\nthe meaning of one of those things. A metaphor is an extended simile without the clue\n\"like\" or \"as.\" </p>\n\n<p>\"A mighty fortress is our God,\" is a metaphor\nintended to communicate the protection available to all that put their trust in God. </p>\n\n<p>\"I am the door,\" is a metaphor intended to show\nthat Christ is the access point to God and to eternal life. </p>\n\n<p>\"Its teeth are the teeth of a lion and it has the\nfangs of a lioness,\" is a metaphor in Joel 1:6 intended to show the ferocity of\nJudah's judgment. </p>\n\n<p>A <b>metonymy</b> is a simile or metaphor intended to\nrepresent something (e.g. Ps.7:10 shield; Ps.22:15-16 potsherd, dogs). </p>\n\n<p><b>Meter</b> </p>\n\n<p>Rhythmical writing that structures a poem. Hebrew poetry is\nnot metrical. English readers are apt to think that poetry must be metrical in order to be\npoetry because much English poetry is that way. This definition is included here because\nsome older scholars tried to find metrical patterns in the Psalms. </p>\n\n<p><b>Onomatopoeia</b> </p>\n\n<p>The formation of a word from the sound the object makes\n(e.g. barking of a dog; hissing of a snake; roaring of an engine). In 17:12, \"...the\nuproar of the peoples - they roar like the roaring of great waters,\" the 'm' and 'n'\nsounds in <i>hamon</i> (uproar) and <i>seon</i> (roaring) sound like waves when read aloud\nin Hebrew. In 42:14, \"like a woman in childbirth, I cry out (<i>pa 'ah</i>), I gasp (<i>nawsham</i>)\nand pant (<i>sha' af</i>),\" are grunting, guttural words reminiscent of sounds made\nby a woman during childbirth. </p>\n\n<p><b>Parable </b></p>\n\n<p>A parable is a fictional short story intended to\ncommunicate some truth. Formal names are not part of parabolic writing; parables are short\nand followed by an explanation (e.g. In 2 Sam.12:1ff Nathan tells David a parable about an\nunjust rich man exploiting a poor man. David does not know it is a parable until Nathan\nreveals that it is a parable about David's treatment of Uriah). </p>\n\n<p><b>Parallelism </b></p>\n\n<p>A standard literary device used in Hebrew poetry and\nprose, although it is more frequently used in poetry. It involves the repetition and\nextension of the ideas in one line by subsequent line(s). * </p>\n\n<p><b>Semantic parallelism</b> involves the repetition and\nextension of the ideas in one line by the next line. The categories of this kind of\nparallelism include: synonymous parallelism; antithetic parallelism; synthetic\nparallelism; emblematic parallelism; repetitive parallelism; pivot pattern and chiasm.<sup><a name=\"Ref3\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/ancscrip.htm#Note3\">[3]</a></sup>&#xA0; * </p>\n\n<p><b>Grammatical parallelism</b> involves the repetition of\nthe parts of speech from one line to the next, although not necessarily in the same order\n(e.g. <i>He rebukes them in his anger</i> {verb-direct object-prepositional phrase} <i>and\nin his wrath he terrifies them </i>{prepositional phrase-verb-direct object}. This serves\nto tie one line with another. </p>\n\n<p>Parallelism and imagery are standard features of Hebrew\npoetry. Meter and rhyme, while important in Western poetry, are not characteristic of\nHebrew poetry </p>\n\n<p><b>Personification </b></p>\n\n<p>The presentation of an idea or value through its\nexpression as a person (e.g. 'the wine he dries up, the field he mourns' Joel 1:10) </p>\n\n<p><b>Recapitulation</b> </p>\n\n<p>A short summary of points previously made. \"Awake\ndrunkards and weep; and wail, all you wine drinkers, on account of the sweet wine that is\ncut off from your mouth,\" from Joel 1:5 is a recapitulation intended to emphasize the\nnature of the audience. </p>\n\n<p><b>Simile </b></p>\n\n<p>When two unlike things are compared (e.g. she is like a\nsummer day). The terms, 'like' or 'as' are often used in such sentences. \"Their\nappearance is like the appearance of horses,\" is a simile from Joel 2:4 intended to\ncommunicate the swiftness of Israel's destruction. </p>\n\n<p><b>Strophe </b></p>\n\n<p>A stanza that is answered by another stanza - twist on\nthe first. </p>\n\n<p><b>Wordplay </b></p>\n\n<p>This is a clever exchange of words, a malapropism<sup><a name=\"Ref4\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/ancscrip.htm#Note4\">[4]</a></sup>&#xA0; or a pun. In Isaiah 13:6, \"...it\nwill come like <b>destruction</b> from the <b>Almighty,</b>\" both words derive from\nthe same root <i>sod</i>. The blow will be such that only God could have delivered it.\nMicah has an entire series of puns in his prophecy about the destruction of several cities\nof Judah (see Micah 1:8-15). <b>Paronomasia</b> is a form of wordplay where homonyms with\ndifferent nuances (Ps.44:15-17 <i>kol</i> (all), <i>qol</i> (sound or taunts) and <i>kol</i>\n(all). <b>Antanaclasis</b> is a paronomasia where the words have contrasting meanings\n(e.t. Ps.69:30-31 a song {<i>sir</i>} is better than a bull {<i>sor</i>}) </p>\n\n<p><strong><a name=\"Schools%20of%20prophetic%20Interpretation\"><b>Schools\nof prophetic Interpretation</b></a> </strong></p>\n\n<p><b>Allegorical Interpretation </b></p>\n\n<p>Some schools of thought have attempted to assign an\nallegorical meaning to prophetic passages. This makes interpretation of prophetic passages\nso subjective and idiosyncratic as to render them meaningless. Sometimes the motivation\nfor this approach is the presupposition that supernatural events (e.g. like predictive\nprophecy or miracles) cannot take place. </p>\n\n<p><b>Application Approaches </b></p>\n\n<p>In this case a prophecy from an earlier time is used\nfor its applicability to a contemporary situation. However, the person making the\napplication is not trying to suggest that the reference should be interpreted to refer to\nthe contemporary situation (e.g. don't muzzle the ox used by Paul to argue for the fiscal\nsupport of elders but he is not trying to say that this law was written for the purpose of\nelder fiscal support.). </p>\n\n<p><b>Literal Interpretation</b> </p>\n\n<p>This school of thought holds that supernatural events can\ntake place and thus the plain meaning of a passage is preferred. This approach should not\nbe confused with a literalistic method of interpretation. A literalistic approach would\nrequire the reader to believe that Christ was an actual door when he said, <i>I am the\ndoor</i>. This method of interpretation does recognize that predictive prophecies can be\nquite challenging to interpret and thus acknowledges prophecy may have one of several\ndifferent forms. </p>\n\n<p><a name=\"Prophetic%20forms\"><strong><b>Prophetic forms</b></strong></a> </p>\n\n<p>Isaiah is cited many times in the New Testament and in\nseveral of those cases the Isaiah passage is said to be fulfilled by some event in the\nlife of Christ. If we understand fulfillment in a narrow manner, that is, a prediction is\nmade and it comes to pass, then it will be difficult to reconcile these passages because\nthey clearly have meaning for Isaiah's times. It is helpful to recognize that the term\ntranslated 'fulfill' has a broader meaning than this. The term 'fulfill' carries the\ndenotation, 'filled to the full' or 'complete.' Thus, it could be said that an event\nfulfills an earlier statement because the theology of that is consonant with that of the\nnew event. Similarly, if an event finishes off or consummates an earlier event then it\ncould be said to be the fulfillment. For instance, Christ fulfills the Law because his\nsacrifice is in accordance with the conditions of the Law and because his sacrifice\nreplaces it. </p>\n\n<p><b>Developmental or Gap Prophecies </b></p>\n\n<p>Some prophecies seem partially fulfilled in the near\nterm but only completely fulfilled later, perhaps in our future. These are referred to as\nprophetic gaps. Daniel's 70 <i>weeks</i> prophecies are thought to include a gap between\nthe 69th 7 year period and the 70th 7 year period that extends into our own time. </p>\n\n<p><b>Double-reference Prophecies </b></p>\n\n<p>According to some scholars there are some prophecies\nthat have meaning in the context of the prophet but seem also to address events quite\nremoved from the times of the prophet. The first event/person to which the prophecy refers\nis known as the <i>type</i>. The second event/person is the <i>antitype</i>. An opposing\nschool of thought holds that only one interpretation can be assigned to a prophecy\n(Single-meaning). </p>\n\n<p><b>Type Prophecies </b></p>\n\n<p>People, events or objects that had a clear meaning in\ntheir time but which served to foreshadow people, events or objects in the future (e.g.\nthe OT law and religious practices foreshadowed Christ; Abraham and Isaac foreshadowed God\noffering Christ as a sacrifice). Much of the book of Hebrews is devoted to expounding the\ntype nature of the OT sacrificial system.</p>\n\n<p><sup><strong>Notes:</strong></sup></p>\n\n<p><a name=\"Note1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>&#xA0; In <i>Psalms</i>\nfrom the <i>Expositors Bible Commentary.

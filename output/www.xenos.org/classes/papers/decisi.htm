The\n  following points represent a measure of agreement as well as difference. We advance these\n  points for discussion and debate. </h3>\n<h5 class=\"style1\">1. Many passages cited to support the idea of subjective leading are invalid because\nthey are misinterpreted.</h5>\n\n<ul class=\"style1\">\n  <li>Rom. 8:l4; Gal. 5:l8; Ps. 32:8; Eph. 5:l0,l7; Rom. l2:2 refer to the revealed, moral\n    will of God. </li>\n  <li>Col. 3:l5 refers to peace between believers. </li>\n  <li>Prov. 3:5,6 refers to learning wisdom from the Word. </li>\n  <li>I Jn. 2:27 refers to discerning false prophets. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">2. The examples of decision-making in Acts and the Epistles generally break down into\ntwo types:</h5>\n\n<ul class=\"style1\">\n  <li>Special Revelation (Acts l3:2; l6:9,l0;18:9,10) </li>\n  <li>Spiritual Expedience (Acts l5:22; I Cor. l6:4; Titus 3:12; I Thes. 3:1,2; Luke 13:31-33;\n    Phil. 2:25,26; Acts 6:2-4;20:16) </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">3. There is no evidence that circumstances are definitive for leading in the New\nTestament economy (II Cor. 2:l2,l3 - Paul did not feel compelled to stay in Troas; I Cor.\nl6:8,9 - even though there were adversaries, Paul stayed on until Pentecost). The decision\nto either use or pass up an \"open door\" was based on spiritual expedience.</h5>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">4. While God can lead through inner feelings, any leading based on feelings can only\nbe tentatively held. Furthermore, where the Word is clear, feelings must be overruled.</h5>\n\n<ul class=\"style1\">\n  <li>a. The proper role of feelings is, in general, to respond to God's will, not to\n    interpret God's will. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">5. God does provide guidance through gifts which involve intuition. Prophecy (Acts\n11:27-30; Gal. 2:2), distinguishing of spirits (I Cor. l2:8), tongues and interpretation\n(I Cor. l2:l0) and knowledge (or discernment I Cor. l2:8) are all gifts in which intuition\nplays a major role. However, it should be noted that:</h5>\n\n<ul class=\"style1\">\n  <li>Whenever possible, guidance from such gifts is subjected to the objective test of\n    scripture (I Cor. l4:29; I Cor. l2:l-3; I Jn. 4:l-3). </li>\n  <li>The quality of life of the gifted person is to be closely scrutinized (Mt. 7:l5-20). </li>\n  <li>The content of such guidance in the New Testament tends to relate to the ministry of the\n    church rather than to private, personal interests (see Acts 11:27ff). </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">6. The \"leading of the Holy Spirit\" could refer to the Holy Spirit reminding\nand convicting the believer of God's moral will in specific situations (Jer. 3l:33; Heb.\nl0:l6). It could also refer, at times, to direct intuitive verbal communication. </h5>\n\n<ul class=\"style1\">\n  <li>It also seems to involve empowering the believer to do God's moral will (Gal.\n    5:l8--content; Rom. 8:l4--content) </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">7. The role of prayer in guidance includes:</h5>\n\n<ul class=\"style1\">\n  <li>Asking for wisdom (James l:5) - the illumination of the mind to view the situation from\n    the perspective of God's revealed will. </li>\n  <li>Sensitizing the believer to conviction of God's moral will. </li>\n  <li>Reflection on data relevant to the situation. </li>\n  <li>Resolving to do God's moral will (Mt. 26:36-46) and asking for the power to do it. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">9. Supernatural guidance can occur through either direct revelation or prophecy.\nHowever:</h5>\n\n<ul class=\"style1\">\n  <li>Such revelations are not necessary for life direction or spiritual maturity. </li>\n  <li>They are liable to deception and abuse. Therefore, care should be exercised. </li>\n  <li>Unless a prophet has a proven record to verify his prophecy (including no errors), he\n    cannot expect others to believe him. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Discussion Questions </h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Which of the following \"road-signs\" do you consider to be useful in\ndetermining God's will for your life? Explain the usefulness and/or limitations of each. \n</p><ol class=\"style1\">\n  <li>Personal desires </li>\n  <li>Inner Peace </li>\n  <li>Common sense </li>\n  <li>Scripture </li>\n  <li>Mature counsel </li>\n  <li>Results </li>\n  <li>Circumstances </li>\n  <li>Special Revelation (visions, or prophecies) </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/outlines.htm\">Return to the Outlines page</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to the Xenos home page</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=decision%20making\">Ask\nDennis a question or share a comment.</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"mailto:DeLashmuttG@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=decision%20making\">Ask Gary\na question or share a comment.</a> </p>\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Decision Making and the Will of God: A Response","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/papers/decisi.htm"}

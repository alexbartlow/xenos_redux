Allusions to Caananite creation myths are\nincorporated into many passages arguing for God's supremacy. <i>Rahab, The Proud One,\nLeviathan, The Twisting One, Yam and The Sea</i> are all titles of someone or something\nwith which Yaweh does battle.<sup><a name=\"Ref1\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/paganot.htm#Note1\">[1]</a></sup> &#xA0;\n5 of these 12 or so passages connect this battle with creation itself. </p>\n\n<p>He quieted the sea (Yam) with his power and by his\nunderstanding he shattered Rahab. By his breath the heavens are cleared; his hand pierced\nthe fleeing serpent. - Job 26:12-13 </p>\n\n<p>You divided the sea (Yam) by your strength; you broke the\nheads of the sea-monsters in the waters. You crushed the heads of Leviathan; You gave him\nas food for the creatures of the wilderness. You broke open springs and torrents; you\ndried up ever-flowing streams. Yours is the day, yours is the night; you have prepared the\nlight and the sun. You have established all the boundaries of the earth; you have made\nsummer and winter. - Ps.74:13ff </p>\n\n<p>Comparisons between battle myths from the ancient Near East<sup><a name=\"Ref2\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/paganot.htm#Note2\">[2]</a></sup>&#xA0; and biblical narratives suggest to\nsome scholars<sup><a name=\"Ref3\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/paganot.htm#Note3\">[3]</a></sup>&#xA0; that Hebrew\naccounts of Yaweh-monster battles are anti-pagan polemics rather than evidence that Hebrew\ntheology is borrowed from surrounding nations. </p>\n\n<p>Three features are typical of Near Eastern battle myths\naccording to Wakeman: 1. A repressive monster<sup><a name=\"Ref4\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/paganot.htm#Note4\">[4]</a></sup>\n&#xA0; prevents creation; 2. The monster is defeated by a god<sup><a name=\"Ref5\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/paganot.htm#Note5\">[5]</a></sup>&#xA0; who thereby looses certain life forces<sup><a name=\"Ref6\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/paganot.htm#Note6\">[6]</a></sup>&#xA0; and 3. The victorious god masters the\nlife forces to create<sup><a name=\"Ref7\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/paganot.htm#Note7\">[7]</a></sup>&#xA0; and is\nelevated to king of the gods status. </p>\n<div>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><b>Source</b> </p></td>\n    <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><b>Repressive\n    monster</b> </p></td>\n    <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><b>Monster's\n    Defeat</b> </p></td>\n    <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><b>Creation</b> </p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><b>Sumerian </b>- the feats and\n    exploits of Ninurta </td>\n    <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Asag (lit. to restrain) restrains\n    Kur (waters) </td>\n    <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Ninurta (son of Enlil the\n    separator of heaven &amp; earth) destroys Asag causing a great flood. </td>\n    <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Ninurta restrains the flood to\n    form the Tigris river.

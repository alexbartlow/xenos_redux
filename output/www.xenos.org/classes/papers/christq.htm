We spend a few\n  minutes challenging them with these before covering the <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/christo.htm\">Christology\n    Outline</a>. </h3>\n<ol>\n  <li class=\"style1\">Could Christ sin or couldn't He? See Lk. 4:1,2 &amp; Jas. 1:13. Use scripture to support\n    your answer.<br>\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    <br>\n  </li>\n  <li class=\"style1\">It is taught that Christ emptied himself of the use of his divine attributes and lived\n    as a human being. What application does this have for the Christian life?<br>\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    <br>\n  </li>\n  <li class=\"style1\">Where did Christ go between His death and resurrection? See I Pet. 3:19; 4:6; Eph. 4:9.<br>\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    <br>\n  </li>\n  <li class=\"style1\">Why is the resurrection of Christ important? Give scriptures which support your answers.<br>\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    <br>\n  </li>\n  <li class=\"style1\">What is Christ doing now?<br>\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    <br>\n  </li>\n  <li class=\"style1\">Which of these issues are essential? Which are not? Why? <br>\n    <br>\n    <br>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">If you had trouble answering any of these questions, you need work on you Christology!</h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=discussion%20questions\">Ask\nDennis a question or share a comment.</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"mailto:DeLashmuttG@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=discussion%20question\">Ask\nGary a question or share a comment.</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/outlines.htm\">Return to the Outlines page</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to the Xenos home page</a> </p>\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Discussion Questions\nfor Christology","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/papers/christq.htm"}

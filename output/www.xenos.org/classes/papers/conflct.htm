At Xenos, we have found that improperly managed conflict is the leading cause of\n  home church failure. During the combined home church leadership weekend this year, we\n  would like to examine the question of inter-personal conflict and our response to it. This\n  paper provides insight from Donald Bosart and others intended to stimulate thinking on the\npart of leaders in preparation for more detailed discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"style1\">The Nature of Conflict</h2>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">It is a mistake to view conflict as undesirable in group leaderships. Conflict is not\nonly unavoidable, it is actually a normal and even helpful part of normal small group\nfunctioning. Donald Bossart has summarized the views of sociologists and psychologists\nthat conflict is necessary in a normal social group. Conflict serves as a vehicle for\nchange, group definition, and self-expression. He states,</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>Conflicts which concern goals, values, or interests that do not contradict the basic\n  assumptions upon which relationships are founded tend to be positively functional for\n  persons and social structures.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/conflct.htm#Footnote1B\" name=\"Footnote1A\">Footnote1</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">However, not all conflict is positive in effect: </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>Not every type of conflict is likely to be of positive benefit, just as it is true that\n  not every type of conflict is likely to be of detriment for individuals or groups.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/conflct.htm#Footnote2B\" name=\"Footnote2A\">Footnote2</a> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">There is no reason to think we will ever be without conflict. Here we are suggesting in\naddition that we should never want to be without it. Conflict is important in creating the\ntension needed for creativity and accelerated learning.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/conflct.htm#Footnote3B\" name=\"Footnote3A\">Footnote3</a> In the book of Acts, we see the apostles and others\nengaging in conflict, and this conflict in turn issuing in positive change. For example,\nin Acts 6 the conflict between Hellenistic and Hebraic Jews resulted in the appointment of\nthe seven servants. In Acts 15, the dispute over law and grace resulted in a definitive\ndeclaration of the doctrine of grace. God has used the pressure of conflict at many\njunctures to further his purposes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">If a leadership never experiences conflict, it suggests one of several pathologies,\nincluding repression of conflict and premature consensus. </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>There is a pathology with the use of this cooperative process which is liable to be\n  found with use in the church. It is the pathology of premature agreement. This means a\n  superficial convergence of beliefs and values before the underlying differences can come\n  out.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/conflct.htm#Footnote4B\" name=\"Footnote4A\">Footnote4</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Sociologist Irving Janis has coined the phrase \"group think\" to describe the\npathology of premature consensus evident in groups that are determined to avoid conflict.\nIt is clear that any group tends to have certain underlying assumptions that constitute\nthe ideological basis of their existence. What features would be evident in addition which\nwould signal the presence of group think? Janis lists the following, \n</p><ol class=\"style1\">\n  <p>1. Dissenters and opposing views are not argued with, but merely ignored. </p>\n  <p>2. There is a belief in group invulnerability; decisions made by the group cannot be\n  wrong. </p>\n  <p>3. Rationalization is evident. Evidence to the contrary of decisions and plans that\n  have been made is minimized.</p>\n  <p>4. Negative stereotypes of outsiders.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/conflct.htm#Footnote5B\" name=\"Footnote5A\">Footnote5</a></p>\n</ol>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">On the other hand, conflict is not always good, and can be quite destructive. What will\ndetermine when conflict will be helpful, and when it will destroy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Types of Conflict</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">One key, given by Bossart, is whether the linkage of conflicting relationships is\ncompetitive or cooperative. In competition linkage, I can only attain my goals if you fail\nto attain yours (e.g. a track race). In cooperative linkage, I can only attain my goal if\nyou succeed in attaining yours. Cooperation encourages perception of similarity of\nattitudes, which leads to the tendency to avoid coercion and use persuasion. Competition\nencourages an approach to conflict which seeks to win, and is willing to see the other\nparties suffer loss in the process. Suspicion is natural in competitive relationships, but\nmay also appear in cooperative relationships.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">It should be clear that, from a biblical perspective, the leadership of the local\nchurch is involved in cooperative linkage, although this may not be the view of its\nmembers. Unfortunately, we sometimes discover that a competitive attitude has taken hold,\nthereby bringing in a different dynamic in conflict. Bossart explains,</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>Conflict behaviors in the competitive mode are designed to destroy, injure, or control\n  another party or parties, and the relationship is one in which the parties gain only at\n  the other's expense, the key is a win/lose relationship.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/conflct.htm#Footnote6B\" name=\"Footnote6A\">Footnote6</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">This tendency is exacerbated by the fact that a Home church leadership team is usually\nclosely knit. This closeness is not a safeguard against violent conflict. In fact, it can\nintensify the effect.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>Closely knit groups, with a high frequency of interaction and high personality\n  involvement, tend to suppress conflict. Feelings of hostility tend to accumulate and\n  intensify. If conflict does break out in such type of groups, it will emerge with high\n  intensity&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. In other groups where individuals only participate with\n  less than their total personality involvement, conflict will be less likely to be\n  disruptive&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. The multiplicity of conflict stands in inverse relation to\n  the intensity.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/conflct.htm#Footnote7B\" name=\"Footnote7A\">Footnote7</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Bosart observes that the local church is more likely to suppress conflict than perhaps\nany other entity. This stems both from fear arising from previous destructive conflicts,\nand faulty theology which sees the absence of conflict as an ideal to be upheld. In other\nwords, churches will often view conflict as wicked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Another reason that churches repress conflict may be the presence of conflict with\npeople and forces outside of the church. When the local church perceives itself as being\nat war with the Kosmos, other churches, and hostile individuals, they fall within the\nscope of the \"embattled group\" mentality.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>Groups which are engaged in continued struggle with others [outsiders] must claim the\n  total personality of their members, and therefore quash internal conflict in order to\n  mobilize all energies for the external fight.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/conflct.htm#Footnote8B\" name=\"Footnote8A\">Footnote8</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Other factors in conflict</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Goser differentiates between realistic and non-realistic conflict.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/conflct.htm#Footnote9B\" name=\"Footnote9A\">Footnote9</a> Realistic conflict is conflict that arises from\nfrustration of specific demands within a relationship. The parties feel a sense of\nfrustration which is directed at the other parties.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">On the other hand, non-realistic conflict is unrelated to specific goal frustration.\nBosart explains it this way:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>Non-realistic conflict is not occasioned by the rival ends of antagonists, but rather\n  by the need for tension release on at least one of them. This type is not issue directed,\n  and not directed toward the attainment of a specific result or end&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.\n  Non-realistic conflict comes from such sources as deprivations and frustration from a\n  socializing process and later role obligations, or from a conversion of an originally\n  realistic conflict which was not allowed expression. Realistic conflict need not be\n  accompanied by hostility and aggressiveness. These can also be seen as interactional vs.\n  interpersonal sources of conflict.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/conflct.htm#Footnote10B\" name=\"Footnote10A\">Footnote10</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Rensis and Likert call these substantive and affective (i.e. emotional) types of\nconflict.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/conflct.htm#Footnote11B\" name=\"Footnote11A\">Footnote11</a> In affective conflict,\nthe resolution of specific issues fails to end the conflict. Instead, it later re-surfaces\nin another area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Constructive vs. Destructive Conflict</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Bosart explains the basic features of constructive and destructive conflict.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>Constructive conflict is that situation in which all are satisfied with the outcome and\n  feel that they have gained as a result. Destructive conflict is that situation in which\n  participants feel dissatisfied with the outcome and all feel they have lost as a result.\n  Constructive conflict, or productive conflict, is based upon the idea that conflict is not\n  inherently pathological or destructive. It does have positive possibilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">and,</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>Conflict can be constructive if it is able to arouse motivation to solve the problem.\n  It involves the acceptance of the necessity of a change in the status quo, rather than a\n  rigid defensive adherence to previous conditions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">On the other hand,</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>The course of destructive conflict tends to expand the conflict or escalate it. This\n  leads the conflict to become independent of the initiating causes and continue after those\n  causes have become past and irrelevant. An increase can be observed in the reliance on\n  power, threat, coercion, and deception. Competition, misperception, and pressure for\n  social consistency all work to further the escalation of the destructive conflict. This\n  leads to a suspicion and hostile attitude which increases sensitivity to differences and\n  threats, while minimizing the awareness of similarities. The pressure for self-consistency\n  within may lead us to an unwitting involvement in and intensification of conflict as our\n  actions have to be justified, both to ourselves and to others.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/conflct.htm#Footnote12B\" name=\"Footnote12A\">Footnote12</a> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Hostility is evident in destructive conflict. Bosart defines hostility as \"having\na spirit of enmity, antipathy, or hatred.\" It involves a tendency toward conflict,\nbut does not always end in it. He believes that, if not allowed to be expressed, hostility\ncan build. Do you think this is right?</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The key to turning conflict away from the destructive and toward the constructive is an\natmosphere of receptivity and openness. Bosart continues,</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>This non-threatening environment is critical! Threat reduces that tolerance for\n  ambiguity and the openness to new ideas. The excessive tension can lead to privatization\n  and stereotyping of thought (closed mind). New ideas are important for resolving conflict,\n  and they must be free to be shared and received.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/conflct.htm#Footnote13B\" name=\"Footnote13A\">Footnote13</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The fear of conflict can lead to a rejection of the concept of personal power in spite\nof the fact that this is really impossible. The fact is that people do have power in their\nrelationships, and this is a fact that can be denied, but not changed. Students of\ninter-personal relationships are aware that power and influence is always present in\npersonal relationships and organizations. This fact should be accepted and the potential\nabuses controlled. Instead we often see something different,</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>The fear of power as control and dominance and the conviction that it has no place in\n  the loving community has kept power as an immobilizing image in the church. As a result,\n  the church has been criticized as a loving community that does not know how to act or to\n  move with any intentional force.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/conflct.htm#Footnote14B\" name=\"Footnote14A\">Footnote14</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Pride, ambition and Conflict</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">When the aspects of conflict mentioned above are considered, we are driven to the\nconclusion that pride and ambition play a central role in destructive conflict. Andrew\nMurray argues that pride, which was the cause of the fall, is the essence of sin. Consider\nthe following statements. Do you think Murray is going over-board? \n</p><ul class=\"style1\">\n  <li>Pride, or the loss of this humility, is the root of every sin and evil.</li>\n  <li>.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;the life of the saved ones, of the saints, must needs bear this\n    stamp of deliverance from sin, and full restoration to their original state; their whole\n    relation to God and man marked by an all-pervading humility.</li>\n  <li>The lack of humility is the sufficient explanation of every defect and\n    failure&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. it alone takes the right attitude before God, and allows him\n    as God to do all.</li>\n  <li>In the life of earnest Christians&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. humility ought to be the chief\n    mark of their uprightness.</li>\n  <li>Let us, at the very commencement of our meditations, admit that there is nothing so\n    natural to man, nothing so insidious and hidden from our sight, nothing so difficult and\n    dangerous, as pride.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/conflct.htm#Footnote15B\" name=\"Footnote15A\">Footnote15</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Competition and rivalry are also factors in the morphology of destructive conflict.\nConsider the following passages from Luke James and Peter.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>Luke 14:6 And He began speaking a parable to the invited guests when He noticed how\n  they had been picking out the places of honor {at the table;} saying to them,</p>\n  <p>14:8 \"When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not take the place of\n  honor, lest someone more distinguished than you may have been invited by him,</p>\n  <p>14:9 and he who invited you both shall come and say to you, 'Give place to this man,'\n  and then in disgrace you proceed to occupy the last place.</p>\n  <p>14:10 \"But when you are invited, go and recline at the last place, so that when\n  the one who has invited you comes, he may say to you, 'Friend, move up higher'; then you\n  will have honor in the sight of all who are at the table with you.</p>\n  <p>14:11 \"For everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, and he who humbles\n  himself shall be exalted.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>JAMES 3:13 Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior\n  his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom.</p>\n  <p>3:14 But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be\n  arrogant and {so} lie against the truth.</p>\n  <p>3:15 This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, natural,\n  demonic.</p>\n  <p>3:16 For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil\n  thing.</p>\n  <p>3:17 But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full\n  of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy.</p>\n  <p>3:18 And the seed whose fruit is righteousness is sown in peace by those who make\n  peace.</p>\n  \n  <p>1PETER 5:2 Be shepherds of God's flock that is under your care, serving as\n  overseers--not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not\n  greedy for money, but eager to serve;</p>\n  <p>3 not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock.</p>\n  <p>4 And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will\n  never fade away.</p>\n  <p>5 Young men, in the same way be submissive to those who are older. All of you, clothe\n  yourselves with humility toward one another, because, \"God opposes the proud but\n  gives grace to the humble.\"</p>\n  <p>6 Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due\n  time. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Questions for discussion</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">What does it mean to exalt one's self? Would it be wrong, according to this parable,\nfor me to suggest that I should teach more in HC?</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Would it be wrong to suggest that I deserve leadership recognition more than brother x?\nWould this be wrong rarely, sometimes, or always?</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">What should be the attitude of a leader who serves in a church with another leader who\nis more gifted at leadership and teaching? Be realistic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">What should be the response of a leader in HC if another leader is asked to serve in a\nhigher post (i.e. elder etc.)?</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">What is the difference between ambition and selfish ambition? Isn't ambition always\nselfish?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/conflct.htm#Footnote1A\" name=\"Footnote1B\">Footnote1</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Donald E.

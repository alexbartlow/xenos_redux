Marduk was their son. </p>\n  <p>Other gods included: Sin, the moon god; Ningal, wife of\n  Sin; Ishtar, the fertility goddess and her husband Tammuz; Allatu, goddess of the\n  underworld ocean; Nabu, the patron of science/learning and Nusku, god of fire. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Canaanite Pantheon </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Canaanites borrowed heavily from the Assyrians.\n  According to Ugaritic literature, the Canaanite pantheon was headed by El, the creator\n  god, whose wife was Asherah. Their offspring was Baal, who married Anath (The OT indicates\n  that Ashtoreth, a.k.a. Ishtar, was Baal's wife). Dagon, Resheph, Shulman, Koshar and Mot\n  were other gods of this pantheon. The cultic practices included animal sacrifices at high\n  places; sacred groves, trees or carved wooden images of Asherah. Divination, snake worship\n  and ritual prostitution were practiced. Sexual rites were supposed to ensure fertility of\n  people, animals and lands. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Egyptian Pantheon<sup><a name=\"Ref2\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/aneidola.htm#Note2\">[2]</a></sup> &#xA0; </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Egyptian religion was never unified. Typically deities were\n  prominent by locale. Only priests worshipped in the temples of the great gods. Only when\n  the gods were on parade did the populace get to worship them. These 'great gods' were\n  treated like human kings by the priesthood: awakened in the morning with song; washed and\n  dressed the image; served breakfast, lunch and dinner. The cults of Ra and Osiris, his\n  sister/wife Isis and son Horus<sup><a name=\"Ref3\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/aneidola.htm#Note3\">[3]</a></sup>\n  &#xA0; were as close to a national religion as it got. Typically families worshipped\n  household gods. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Essentially Egyptian religion involved the worship of\n  nature dieties. Anubis was a jackal god; Sobk a crocodile god; Horus &amp; Ra were\n  associated with the falcon; Thoth was associated with an ibis and connected with wisdom\n  &amp; the moon; Ma 'et (a.k.a. Maat, the daughter of Re) the godess of truth, justice,\n  right &amp; cosmic order; Nut the sky goddess; Shu the god of air; Nu the god of\n  primordial waters; Geb the god of earth; Osiris god of the realm of the dead, vegetation\n  and thus the rise of the Nile. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Kitchen believes it's unlikely that the exodus Hebrew's\n  were focused on the Apis bull cult of Memphis or the Mnevis bull cult of Heliopolis when\n  they charged Aaron to make them a god.<sup><a name=\"Ref4\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/aneidola.htm#Note4\">[4]</a></sup>\n  &#xA0; Instead he believes there were bull cults associated with Horus in regions around\n  Gomer. These cults were associated with strength and fertility. Also, he suggests that the\n  close proximity to Caanan meant that these cults were probably similar to the Hadad (Baal)\n  worship there, which was also associated with the bull, strength and fertility. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Moabite Pantheon </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The chief god was Chemosh (a.k.a. Athtar). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Philistine Pantheon (c.f. Canaanite Pantheon) </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Gaza and Ashdod--the chief god was Dagon </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ashkelon--Ashtoreth </p>\n  <p>Ekron--Baalzebub </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Syrian Pantheon (c.f.

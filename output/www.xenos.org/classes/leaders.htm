Ten weeks of three hour lecture-recitation with a final paper.</p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/homiletics/index.htm\"><b>Homiletics (Bible Teaching) Workshop</b></a>\n        - In the first two weeks of this five-week workshop, the instructor focuses\n        on how to compose a teaching outline and explore keys to dynamic and\n          authoritative speaking. During the last three weeks, students present\n          at least two ten-minute\n        teachings and receive feedback from the instructor, teacher assistants,\n        and other participants. The speeches are recorded on video tape for self-criticism.</p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/discussion/index.htm\"><b>Teaching Through Group Discussion</b></a>\n        - Some discussions are boring and uninformative. This five week class\n        teaches home group leaders how to lead discussion that leaves everyone\n        feeling like they learned and were able to participate in problem solving.\n        Students learn from lecture and hands-on workshops.</p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/hermeneutics/index.htm\"><b>Hermeneutics</b></a> - Hermeneutics\n        is a highly interactive course designed to teach the methods of biblical\n        interpretation. This 10 week class will explain and apply user-friendly\n        inductive approaches to historical narrative, wisdom literature, prophets,\n        gospels, and epistles. Particular emphasis is given to applying inductive\n        study to teaching and discussion leading. The class is designed for people\n        involved in teaching and leadership ministries and requires membership\n        on the Servant Team. Course materials are designed to be easily adapted\n        to individual and small group study. Participants complete a workbook\n        on inductive biblical interpretation.</p>\n      <p><b>Challenge Groups</b> - These groups are for leaders who want to explore\n        a deeper walk with God using study materials on Bible biographies, devotional\n        literature, and inductive studies of key passages. The focus is on applying\n        the principles of spiritual growth to real life and developing reality\n        in leaders' lives.</p>\n      <p><b>Teacher's Prep Workshop</b> - This 5-week workshop equips home group\n        and study group leaders to prepare high quality Bible teachings and guided\n        discussions. Beginning with an inductive study of 2 Timothy, students\n        develop a complete teaching series from the book. Course content is practical,\n        focusing on biblical interpretation techniques, cultivating a spiritual\n        burden for the text, and developing teachings. This limited enrollment\n        workshop is highly interactive, combining individual inductive study\n        with class discussions and collaborative in-class exercises.</p>\n      \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Classes for Leaders","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/leaders.htm"}

They did not foresee what in fact has happened, above all\n      in our Western capitalist democracies--the development of a vast mass communications\n      industry, concerned in the main neither with the true nor the false, but with the unreal,\n      the more or less totally irrelevant. In a word, they failed to take into account man's\n      almost infinite appetite for distractions...Only the vigilant can maintain their\n      liberties, and only those who are constantly and intelligently on the spot can hope to\n      govern themselves effectively by democratic procedures.\" Aldous Huxley, <i>Brave New\n      World Revisited</i></p>\n      \n    </blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>Result: Few people know how to think rigorously about things. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <i></i><p>Tools of critical reasoning are essential to constructively\n    handle doubts.</p>\n    \n  </blockquote>\n  \n  \n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <i></i><p>Greater capacity to plumb the depths of God (Matthew 22:37).</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  \n  <p>2.

Their lack of awareness is due\n      mostly to sheer ignorance of what Christianity is--for that matter, of what any religion\n      is.

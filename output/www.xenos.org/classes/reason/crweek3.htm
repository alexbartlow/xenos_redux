In such a situation, it would be hard to have a normal\n      conversation without Christianity coming up naturally and in a way relevant to the topic\n      of discussion. Moreover, a well-developed mind can see connections between what a friend\n      is saying and other issues of which the friend may not be aware. For example, a friend may\n      be espousing moral relativism yet inconsistently hold that we all have an absolute duty to\n      save the environment. If a person sees the connections, she can simply ask well-placed\n      questions that naturally lead to a discussion of broader worldview issues, including God\n      and our relationship to Him.

There must, therefore, be a uniform experience against every\n      miraculous event, otherwise the event would not merit that appellation. And as a uniform\n      experience amounts to a proof, there is here a direct and full proof, from the nature of\n      the fact, against the existence of any miracle. . .\" (David Hume, <i>An Inquiry\n      Concerning Human Understanding</i>, X, I: 110, 114, 115).</p>\n      \n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>\"According to Hume, probability rests on what may be\n      called the majority vote of our past experiences. The more often a thing has been known to\n      happen, the more probable it is that it should happen again; and the less often the less\n      probable. Now the regularity of Nature&#x92;s course, says Hume, is supported by something\n      better than the majority vote of past experiences; it is supported by their unanimous\n      vote, or, as Hume says, by &#x91;firm and unalterable experience.&#x92; There is, in fact,\n      &#x91;uniform experience&#x92; against miracle; otherwise, says Hume, it would not be a\n      miracle. A miracle is therefore the most improbable of all events. It is always more\n      probable that the witnesses were lying or mistaken than that a miracle occurred. Now of\n      course we must agree with Hume that if there is absolutely &#x91;uniform experience&#x92;\n      against miracles, if in other words they have never happened, why then they never have. <i>Unfortunately\n      we know the experience against them to be uniform only if we know that all the reports of\n      them are false. And we can call the reports to be false only if we know already that\n      miracles have never occurred. In fact, we are arguing in a circle.</i>\" C.S.

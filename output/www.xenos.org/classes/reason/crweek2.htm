We must put moral reasoning in a special category, and use transcendental\n    guidelines as required. </p>\n    <p>No, we do not have to put moral reasoning in a special category and use transcendental\n    premises, because the naturalistic fallacy is itself a fallacy. For if ought is not is,\n    what is? To translate is into ought makes sense if we attend to the objective meaning of\n    ethical precepts. They are very unlikely to be ethereal messages awaiting revelation, or\n    independent truths vibrating in a nonmaterial dimension of the mind. They are more likely\n    to be products of the brain and culture. </p>\n    <p>The empiricist view, searching for an origin of ethical reasoning&#x85; The individual\n    is seen as predisposed biologically to make certain choices. Through cultural evolution\n    some of the choices are hardened into precepts, then into law, and, if the predisposition\n    or coersion is strong enough, into a belief in the command of God&#x85; The general\n    empiricist principle takes this form: Strong innate feeling and historical experience\n    cause certain actions to be preferred; we have experienced them, and have weighed their\n    consequences, and agree to conform with codes that express them. Let is take an oath upon\n    the codes, invest our personal honor in them, and suffer punishment for their violations.</p>\n    <p>The empiricist view concedes that moral codes are devised to conform to some drives of\n    human nature and to suppress others. Ought is the translation not of human nature but of\n    the public will, which can be made increasingly wise and stable through an understanding\n    of the needs and pitfalls of human nature.</p>\n    <p>&#x85; People resist biological explanations of their higher cortical functions [so]\n    very little progress has been made in the biological exploration of the moral\n    sentiments&#x85; Paleolithic egalitarian and tribalistic instincts are still firmly\n    installed. As part of the genetic foundation of human nature, they cannot be replaced. In\n    some cases, such as quick hostility to strangers and competing in groups, they have become\n    generally ill adapted and persistently dangerous. Above the fundamental instincts rise\n    superstructures of arguments and rules that accommodate the novel institutions created by\n    cultural evolution. These accommodations, which reflect the attempt to maintain order and\n    further tribal interests, have been too volatile to track by genetic evolution; they are\n    not yet in the genes.</p>\n    <p>There is a hereditary selective advantage to membership in a powerful group united by\n    devout belief and purpose. Even when individuals subordinate themselves and risk death in\n    a common cause, their genes are more likely to be transmitted to the next generation than\n    are those of competing groups who lack comparable resolve.</p>\n    <p>Mathematical models of population genetics suggest the following rule in the\n    evolutionary origin of altruism: the individual pays, his genes and tribe gain, altruism\n    spreads.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<i><b>\n\n</b></i><p>Assessing world views</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>World views as hypotheses</p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>A set of ideas that explain data</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Five tests of world views</p>\n  <p>Adequacy</p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Explains all the relevant data&#x97;or more completely than rival hypotheses</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>External consistency</p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Conforms to other well-established theories and bodies of knowledge</p>\n    <p>\"Burden of proof\" rests with the theory that contradicts what is well\n    established</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Internal coherence</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>All aspects of the hypothesis are self-consistent</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>An hypothesis is incoherent if:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>One or more ideas conflict with each other</p>\n      <p>It can not meet its own criterion for truth</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <i></i><p>Fruitfulness</p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Hypothesis can be successfully applied to life and new situations</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <i></i><p>Biblical </p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>The extent to which the hypothesis is consistent with biblical Christianity</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <i></i><p>Drawing conclusions</p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>True beyond reasonable doubt or true beyond the shadow of doubt?</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Exercises: Wilson&#x92;s essay and The Post-Human</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i><b>\n\n</b></i><p>Assessing modern and postmodern world views</p>\n\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"7\" width=\"590\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"20%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#xA0;</td>\n    <td width=\"20%\" valign=\"TOP\">Adequacy</td>\n    <td width=\"20%\" valign=\"TOP\">Coherence</td>\n    <td width=\"20%\" valign=\"TOP\">External Consistency</td>\n    <td width=\"20%\" valign=\"TOP\">Fruitfulness</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"20%\" valign=\"TOP\">Modernism<p>(Naturalism)</p></td>\n    <td width=\"20%\" valign=\"TOP\">No <i>basis</i> for human value, morality\n    or human dignity</td>\n    <td width=\"20%\" valign=\"TOP\">No \"norms\" possible, including\n    standards of reason&#x97;only pragmatic</td>\n    <td width=\"20%\" valign=\"TOP\">Inconsistent with biological facts about\n    the irreducible nature of biological life</td>\n    <td width=\"20%\" valign=\"TOP\">No one lives consistently with nihilistic\n    implications of naturalism</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"20%\" valign=\"TOP\">Post-Modernism</td>\n    <td width=\"20%\" valign=\"TOP\">No <i>basis</i> for human value, morality\n    or human dignity</td>\n    <td width=\"20%\" valign=\"TOP\">Denial of objective truth is\n    self-defeating</td>\n    <td width=\"20%\" valign=\"TOP\">Fails to understand the substantial\n    uniformity of reason across cultures</td>\n    <td width=\"20%\" valign=\"TOP\">No one lives consistently with the\n    nihilistic implications of postmodern-ism</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n<i><b>\n\n</b></i><p>Commonly encountered errors in reasoning</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Argument from authority.

And the earth was formless  and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God  was moving over the surface of the waters.  Then God said, &#x201C;Let there be light&#x201D;; and there was light. God saw that the light was good; and God  separated the light from the darkness.  God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And there was evening and there was morning,  one day.</p>\n<p> Genesis 1:1-5</p>\n\n<p><em>Uniqueness of God</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The  infinite and transcendent personal God (Deuteronomy 32:40; 33:27; Isaiah 40:28)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>No  genealogy, consort, or origin story for God.  He stands alone outside of creation, speaking it into existence as <em>transcendent Sovereign</em>. </p>\n\n<p><em>Bara</em>, to create, to put in order, to arrange. Speaks to completeness, perfection, and  purpose. Used only of God (Job 10:9;  Isaiah 45:9; Jeremiah 18:6). Creation  reflects God&#x2019;s <em>goodness</em>&#x2014;note the  assessment of each creative day.</p>\n\n<p>Merisms  are statements of opposites indicating totality. All of creation is <em>finite</em> and <em>contingent</em> on  God</p>\n\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Creation  is an act of <em>hesed</em>, loving-kindness</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><u>He loves righteousness and justice</u>; <u>the earth is full of the lovingkindness of the Lord</u>. By the <u>word of the Lord the heavens were  made</u>, and by the breath of His mouth all their host. He gathers the waters of the sea together as  a heap; He lays up the deeps in storehouses.  Let all the earth fear the Lord; let all the inhabitants of the world  stand in awe of Him. For He spoke, and  it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast... <u>Blessed is the nation whose  God is the Lord; the people whom He has chosen for His own inheritance</u>. Psalm 33:5,12</p>\n\n\n<p><em>Humans as God&#x2019;s image-bearers and  blessed</em></p>\n\n<p>Then  God said, &#x201C;Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let  them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the  cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the  earth. God created man in His own image,  in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. God blessed them; and God said to them, &#x201C;Be  fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the  fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that  moves on the earth.</p>\n<p> Genesis 1:26-28</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Human  dignity under the blessing of God</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When  I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars,  which You have ordained; what is man that You take thought of him, and the son  of man that You care for him? Yet You  have made him a little lower than God, and You crown him with glory and majesty! You make him to rule over the works of Your  hands; You have put all things under his feet... O Lord, our Lord, how majestic  is Your name in all the earth!</p>\n<p> Psalm 8:3-6,9</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A  place for humanity in the cosmos</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Subject  of God&#x2019;s blessing and charged with a stewardship</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Creation as salvation: central purpose  of the Genesis narrative</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Creation  and polemic: Yahweh is supreme (Joshua 24:14; Ezekiel 20:16; 23:1-21)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What  Genesis One is undertaking and accomplishing is a radical and sweeping  affirmation of monotheism vis-a-vis polytheism, syncretism, and idolatry. Each day of creation... dismisses an  additional cluster of deities... On the first day, the gods of light and  darkness are dismissed. On the second  day, the gods of sky and sea. On the  third day, earth gods and gods of vegetation.  On the fourth day, sun, moon, and star gods. The fifth and sixth days take away any  associations with divinity from the animal kingdom. And finally human existence, too, is emptied  of any intrinsic divinity&#x2014;while at the same time all human beings, from the  greatest to the least, and not just pharaohs, kings and heroes, are granted a  divine likeness and mediation. </p>\n<p> H. Conrad Hyer, cited in Bruce K.  Waltke, <em>An Old Testament Theology</em>,  177</p>\n\n<p>Genesis  is written to a people steeped in but fleeing from polytheism. The Old Testament has numerous references to  creation/anti-creation deities worshipped by Israel&#x2019;s neighbors. Note references to Yam, Leviathan, Rahab etc. In this sense, the creation narrative and  texts that comment on it are analogous to the victory of Yahweh over the gods  of the Egyptians in the exodus. </p>\n\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Conditions  before the word of creation (Genesis 1:2)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Creation  account is selective and presumes <em>already  existing</em> judgment</p>\n\n<p>For  thus says the Lord, who created the heavens (He is the God who formed the earth  and made it; <u>He established it and did not create it a waste place</u>, but <u>formed  it to be inhabited</u>)</p>\n<p> Isaiah 45:18</p>\n\n<p>I  looked on the earth, and behold, it was <u>formless</u> and <u>void</u>; and to  the heavens, and they had <u>no light</u>.  Jeremiah 4:23</p>\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;Darkness,&#x201D;  &#x201C;formless and void&#x201D; indicate a situation of judgment, emptiness, nothingness  (see Isaiah 24:10; 40:17; 41 29; 34:10; Deuteronomy 32:10; Job 6:18; 26:7;  Jeremiah 4:23; 1 Samuel 12:21; Ps. 107:10-12; 139:7-12).</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>I  am the Lord, and there is no other; besides Me there is no God... I am the  Lord, and there is no other, the One forming light and creating darkness,  causing well-being and creating calamity; I am the Lord who does all  these. Drip down, O heavens, from above,  and let the clouds pour down righteousness; <u>let the earth open up and  salvation bear fruit</u>, and righteousness spring up with it. I, the Lord, have created it.

By the seventh day God completed His work  which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He  had done. Then God blessed the seventh  day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had  created and made. Genesis  2:1-3</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Instructively, this day is represented&#x2014;surely  intentionally&#x2014;as having no evening or night.  God&#x2019;s rest is conceptualized as having no darkness, a negative  theological symbol for oppression and death.  On that day the horrific primordial chaos is banished forever. In other words, <u>by resting on the Sabbath,  Israel experiences the world to come, a world of untarnished blessing that they  are destined to inherit on the &#x201C;day of the Lord</u>.&#x201D;</p>\n<p> Bruce K. Waltke, <em>An Old Testament Theology</em>, 187</p>\n\n<p>Most of all, the rest of the Sabbath day  stands out against the dark silence of the primordial void. Between the stillness of the prologue and the  calm of the epilogue there is a world of difference. <u>The first silence precedes time, the  second sanctifies it</u>. </p>\n<p> Michael Fishbane, <em>Text and Texture</em>, 9</p>\n<p><em>Human  dilemma and a hint of future salvation: Genesis 2, 3</em></p>\n\n<p>The  Lord God commanded the man, saying, &#x201C;From any tree of the garden you may eat  freely; for from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat,  for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die.&#x201D;   Genesis 2:16,17</p>\n\n<p>The  Lord God said to the serpent, &#x201C;Because you have done this, cursed are you more  than all cattle, and more than every beast of the field; on your belly you will  go, and dust you will eat all the days of your life; And I will put enmity  between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise  you on the head, and you shall burse him on the heel.&#x201D;.... To Adam He said...  &#x201C;Cursed is the ground because of you; in toil you will eat of it all the days  of your life. Both thorns and thistles  it shall grow for you; and you will eat the plants of the field; by the sweat  of your face you will eat bread, till you return to the ground, because from it  you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return..&#x201D; </p>\n<p> Genesis  3:14,15,17-19</p>\n\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The  fall and the meaning of salvation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The  problem is death rooted in the power of sin, which is failing to obey God&#x2019;s  word (1 Cor. 15:56)</p>\n\n<p>A  reason for hope in Genesis 3</p>\n\n<p>A  promised &#x201C;seed&#x201D; of the woman</p>\n\n<p>Removal  from the garden</p>\n\n<p>God&#x2019;s  care for man in the fallen state</p>\n\n<p>Repeated  declarations of creation blessing</p>\n\n\n<p><em>Creation theology and the hope of salvation</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Salvation  from darkness and death</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There were those who <u>dwelt in darkness</u> and in the <u>shadow of death</u>, prisoners in misery and chains, <u>because  they rebelled against the words of God</u> and spurned the counsel of the Most  High. Therefore He humbled their heart  with labor; they stumbled and there was none to help. Then they cried out to the Lord in their  trouble; He saved them out of their distress. <u>He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death</u> and broke  their bands apart. </p>\n<p> Psalm 107:10-14</p>\n\n<p>&#x201C;No  longer will you have the sun for light by day, nor for brightness will the moon  give you light; but you will have the Lord for an everlasting light, and your  God for your glory. Your sun will no  longer set, nor will your moon wane; for you will have the Lord for an  everlasting light, and the days of your mourning will be over.  Isaiah 60:19,20</p>\n<p>Salvation  reverses the fall in a regeneration of the spirit</p>\n\n<p>Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew  a steadfast spirit within me. Do not  cast me away from your presence and do not take Your Holy Spirit from me. </p>\n<p> Psalm 51:10,11</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Israel  as a paradigm of creation/redemption salvation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thus says the Lord your <u>Redeemer</u>, the  Holy One of Israel, &#x201C;For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and will bring them  all down as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, into the ships in which they  rejoice. I am the Lord, your Holy One,  the <u>Creator</u> of Israel, your <u>King</u>.&#x201D;  Isaiah  43:14,15</p>\n\n<p>But now, thus says the Lord <u>your Creator</u>,  O Jacob, and He <u>who formed you</u>, O Israel, &#x201C;Do not fear, for I have <u>redeemed</u> you; I have called you by name; you are Mine!  When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the  rivers, they will to overflow you. When  you walk through the fire, you will not be scorched, nor will the flame burn  you. For I am the Lord you God, the Holy  One of Israel, your Savior; I have given Egypt as your ransom, Cush and Seba in  your place. Since you are precious in My  sight, since you are honored and I love you&#x201D;...   Isaiah 43:1-4a</p>\n\n\n<p>Abraham:  reversing the curse through land, fertility, and the restoration of blessing</p>\n\n\n<p>Hope  in exile: life from death in &#x201C;dry bones&#x201D; (Ezekiel 37:1-14)</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Regeneration  in the Spirit is coming</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>God&#x2019;s  New Covenant</p>\n\n<p>I will give you <u>a new heart</u> and put <u>a  new spirit with you</u>; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh  and give you a heart of flesh. I will  put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes.  Ezekiel 36:26,27</p>\n\n<p>&#x201C;Behold, days are coming,&#x201D; declares the Lord,  &#x201C;when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house o  Judah, not like the covenant I made with their fathers, in the day I took them  by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they  broke, although I was a husband to them&#x201D; declares the Lord. &#x201C;But this covenant which I will make with the  house of Israel after those days,&#x201D; declares the Lord, &#x201C;I will put My law within  them and on their heart I will write it; and I will be their God, and they  shall be My people. &#x201C;They will not teach  again, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, &#x2018;Know the Lord,&#x2019;  for they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them., &#x201C;  declares the Lord, &#x201C;for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will  remember no more.&#x201D;  Jeremiah 31:31-34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x201C;I will make an everlasting covenant with  them that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; and I will put the  fear of Me in their hearts so that they will not turn away from Me. I will rejoice over them to do them good and  will faithfully plant them in this land with all My heart and with all My  soul.&#x201D;  Jeremiah 32:40,41</p>\n\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The  coming day of salvation <em>for all nations</em> when death is defeated</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Lord of hosts will prepare a lavish  banquet for <u>all peoples</u> on this mountain; a banquet of aged wine, choice  pieces with marrow, and refined, aged wine.  And on this mountain He will swallow up the covering which is over all  peoples, even the veil which is stretched over the nations. <u>He will swallow up death for all time</u>,  and the Lord God will wipe tears away from all faces, and He will remove the  reproach of His people from all the earth; for the Lord has spoken. And it will be said in the day, &#x201C;Behold, this  is our God for whom we have waited that He might save us. This is the Lord for whom we have waited; let  us rejoice and be glad in His <u>salvation</u>.&#x201D; Isaiah 25:6-9 (cf. 1 Corinthians 15:54-57)</p>\n\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Earth,  creation and new creation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Behold,  I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things will not be  remembered or come to mind. But be glad  and rejoice forever in what I create; for behold, I create Jerusalem for  rejoicing and her people for gladness.  Isaiah 65:17,18</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Creation  and salvation in Christ&#x2014;creation motif spills over into the New Testament</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Jesus  the creator and owner of all</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the  Word was with God, and the Word was  God. He was in the beginning with  God. All things came into being through  Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being. In Him was life, and the life was the Light  of men. The Light shines in the darkness,  and the darkness did not comprehend it. John 1:1-5</p>\n\n<p>He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn  of all creation. For by Him all things  were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether  thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities&#x2014;all things have been created  through Him and for Him. He is before  all things, and in Him all things hold together. Colossians  1:15-17</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, just as through one man sin  entered into the world, and death though sin, and so death spread to all men,  because all sinned... Adam is a <u>type</u> of Him who was to come... So then  as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so  thorough one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all  men. For as through the one man&#x2019;s  disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the  One the many will be made righteous. Romans 5:12,14,18 (cf. 1  Corinthians 15:21,22)</p>\n<p>Salvation  is a &#x201C;new creation,&#x201D; not some patch job on the old:</p>\n\n<p>If any one is in Christ, he is a new  creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come. 2  Corinthians 5:17</p>\n\n<p>&#x201C;You  must be...</p>\n<p>&#x201C;born  again&#x201D; (John 3:3,7); &#x201C;born of the Spirit&#x201D; (John 3:5,6).</p>\n\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Regeneration:  Spirit and life. See also 2 Cor. 4:6;  5:17; Eph. 2:10; 4:23; 5:8; Col. 1:12,13; 2:13; 1 Pet. 2:9</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I  consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared  with the glory that is to be revealed to us.  For the anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revelation  of the sons of God. For <u>the creation  was subjected to futility</u>, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected  it, <u>in hope that the creation itself also will be set free from its slavery  to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God</u>. For we know that the whole creation groans  and suffers the pains of childbirth together until now. And not only this, but also we ourselves,  having the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within  ourselves, waiting eagerly for the adoption as sons, the redemption of our  body. </p>\n<p> Romans 8:18-23</p>\n\n<p>When the <u>kindness of God our Savior</u> and <u>His love for mankind</u> appeared, He saved us, not on the basis of deed  which we have done in righteousness, but <u>according to His mercy</u>, by the <u>washing  of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit</u>, whom He poured out upon us  richly through Jesus Christ our Savior. Titus  3:4-6</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Sabbath  is about <em>rest</em> (Genesis 2:5; Exodus  31:15; Leviticus 25:4)</p>\n\n<p>From  completed work, a time of enjoyment </p>\n\n<p>Promised<em> land </em>is Israel&#x2019;s rest (Deuteronomy  3:20; Jeremiah 46:27)</p>\n\n<p>Life  under God&#x2019;s provision and protection&#x2014;blessing </p>\n\n<p>Disobedience  to God means not entering His rest (Psalm 95:7-11), an enduring picture warning  against unbelief. </p>\n\n<p>This  principle relates to receiving Christ and not returning to Temple sacrifice  (Hebrews 3:7&#x2014;4:10).</p>\n\n<p>Salvation  is God&#x2019;s rest (Matthew 11:28-30; Hebrews 4:1-11).</p>\n\n\n<p>Conclusion of  history: Eden revisited</p>\n\n<p>Then  I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth  passed away, and there is <u>no longer any sea</u> (lit. deep). And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem,  coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her  husband. And I heard a loud voice from  the throne, saying, &#x201C;Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will  dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among  them, and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and <u>there will no  longer be any death</u>; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying, or  pain; for first things have passed away (Revelation 21:1-4)... And he carried  me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy  city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God... I saw no temple in it,  for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple (Revelation 21:10,22;  cf. Jeremiah 3:16,17)... Then he showed me a river of the water of life, clear  as crystal, coming from the throne of God and of the Lamb, in the middle of its  street. On either side of the river was  the <u>tree of life</u>, bearing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit  every month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the  nations. There will <u>no longer be any  curse</u>; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it... and there  will <u>no longer be any night</u>; and they will not have need of the light of  a lamp or the light of the sun, because the Lord God will illumine them; and  they will reign for ever and ever.   Revelation 221-5</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><u>Kingdom:  God&#x2019;s Reign and Salvation</u></p>\n\n\n<p><em>The rule of God and His kingdom</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Promise  to David (2 Samuel 7:8-17; 18-29)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>He shall build a  house for My name, and I <u>will establish the throne of his kingdom forever</u>. <u>I will be a father to him and he will  be a son to Me</u>; when he commits iniquity, I will correct him with the rod  of men and the strokes of the sons of men, but <u>My lovingkindness</u> shall  not depart from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before  you. Your house and your kingdom shall  endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established forever. In accordance with all these words and all  this vision, so Nathan spoke to David. 2 Samuel 7:13-17</p>\n\n<p>Eternal  kingdom (see 2 Sam. 23:5; Ps. 89:28, 29&#x2026;) </p>\n\n<p>Jerusalem is both the &#x201C;city of David&#x201D;  (2 Sam. 5:7,9) and the God&#x2019;s dwelling (1 Kings 11:13; 14:21) and the place from  which God rules (Micah 4:1&#x2014;5)</p>\n\n\n<p>God&#x2019;s kingdom and David&#x2019;s kingdom are  one (see 1 Chron. 28:5; 2 Kings 19:34; 20:6)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unique  father/son relationship (see Psalm 2:6-8; 89:26,27) </p>\n\n<p>The Lord says to my Lord; &#x201C;Sit at My right  hand until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.&#x201D; (see Luke 20:41-44; Acts 2:29-36)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charter  for the nations</p>\n\n<p>Then David the king went in and sat before  the Lord, and he said, &#x201C;Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that You  have brought me this far? Any yet this  was insignificant in Your eyes, O Lord God, for You have spoken also of the  house of Your servant concerning the distant future. And <u>this is the torah of man</u>, O Lord  God. 2  Samuel 7:18,19</p>\n\n\n<p>And it will come about in the last days, that  the mountain of the house of the Lord will be established as the chief of the  mountains. It will be raised above the hills,  and <u>the peoples will stream to it</u>.  Many nations will come and say, &#x201C;come and let us go up to the mountain  of the Lord and to the house of the God of Jacob, their He may teach us about  his ways and that we may walk in His paths.&#x201D;... Then they will hammer their  swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks; nation will not  lift up sword against nation, and never again will they train for war.  Micah 4:1-4 (cf. Isaiah 2:4)</p>\n\n\n<p>My house will be called a house of prayer for <u>all the nations</u>. Isaiah 56:7</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>King  Messiah</em></p>\n\n\n<ul>\n  <li>David and the       messianic motif</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>David as the expected messianic ruler</p>\n\n<p>My  servant David will be king over them, and they will all have on shepherd; and  they will walk in My ordinances and keep My statutes and observe them. They will live on the land I gave to Jacob My  servant, in which your fathers lived; and they will live on it, they, and their  sons and their sons&#x2019; sons, forever; and David My servant will be their prince  forever.

Thus, <u>He will  sprinkle many nations</u>, kings will shut their mouths on account o f Him; for  what had not been told them they will see, and what they had not heard they  will understand.&#x201D; ... By oppression and judgment He was taken away; and as for  His generation, who considered that He was cut off out of the land of the  living for the transgression of my people, to whom the stroke was due?...

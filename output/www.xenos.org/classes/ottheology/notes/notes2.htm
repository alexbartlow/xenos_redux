But God&#x2019;s majesty also offers a challenge in  a different direction. Packer writes,</p>\n<p>He never abandons anyone on whom he has set  his love; nor does Christ, the good shepherd, ever lose track of his  sheep. It is as false as it is  irreverent to accuse God of forgetting, or overlooking, or losing interest in,  the state and needs of his own people.  If you have been resigning yourself to the thought that God has left you  high and dry, seek grace to be ashamed of yourself. Such unbelieving pessimism deeply dishonors  our great God and savior.

The prophetic protest against social injustice is without  close parallel in the ancient world, and it was a protest grounded in a known  law which the powerful were able to subvert by means of legal techniques. The  justice and righteousness of God, therefore, were seen to be especially  solicitous of the weak. --G.E.

Their vision is of man defying God, and God seeking man to reconcile  with him... Had the prophets relied on  human resources for justice and righteousness, on man&#x2019;s ability to fulfill all  of God&#x2019;s demands, on man&#x2019;s power to achieve redemption, they would not have  insisted upon the promise of messianic redemption, for messianism  implies that any course of living, even the supreme efforts of man by himself,  must fail in redeeming the world. In  other words, human history is not sufficient in itself. &#x201D;   --Abraham Heschel, <em>The Prophets</em> 2:214, 235</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>Man&#x2019;s  predicament is a predicament for God (Psalm 49:7-9;15).\n        <ul>\n          <li>&#x201C;God  is concerned about the world, and shares in its fate. Indeed, this is the essence of God&#x2019;s moral  nature: His willingness to be intimately involved in the history of man.   Abraham Heschel <em>The Prophets</em>, 2:291</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>So,  willing to be intimately involved in man&#x2019;s predicament, God is willing also to  suffer with and for man.\n        <ul>\n          <li>&#x201C;[Man  is relevant to God]. To the biblical  mind the denial of man&#x2019;s relevance to God is as inconceivable as the denial of  God&#x2019;s relevance to man. This principle  leads to the basic affirmation of God&#x2019;s participation in human history, to the  certainty that the events in the world concern Him and arouse His  reaction. It finds its deepest  expression in the fact that God can actually suffer.&#x201D; Abraham Heschel,  The Prophets, 2:333,334 </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>The  &#x201C;adultery&#x201D; theme in the prophets is directed toward the broken heart of God in  the face of human idolatry&#x2014;forsaking the Lord:  Hosea 1:2; 2:5-8      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><em>&#x201C;Abounding in hesed&#x201D;</em>\n    <ul>\n      <li>God&#x2019;s  amazing generosity: Generosity means a  disposition to give to others in a way which has no mercenary motive and is not  limited by what the recipients deserve but consistently goes beyond it... Generosity is, so to speak, the focal point  of God&#x2019;s moral perfection; it is the quality which determines how all God&#x2019;s other  excellences are to be displayed... God overflows with generosity. --J.I. Packer, <em>Knowing God</em>, 162</li>\n      <li>Is  God holding back his blessings from you?</li>\n      <li>Do  you think that God desires to give you all good things <em>for no other reason </em>than that you are his child and he delights in  you?\n        <ul>\n          <li>You are precious in  My sight, You are honored and  I love you. --Isaiah 43:4          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Hesed of God and the prophetic voice</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>To  speak for God, it is crucial to experience the world <em>as</em> he does. \n    <ul>\n      <li>&#x201C;Our conviction as  to [the prophets&#x2019;] existence is based on directly experienced fellowship with  God. To the prophet, knowledge of God  was fellowship with him, not attained by syllogism, analysis, or induction, but  by living together... The prophets  witness the misery that man endures as well as man&#x2019;s wickedness that God  endures. But God is wrestling with man&#x201D;  (and so is his prophet).

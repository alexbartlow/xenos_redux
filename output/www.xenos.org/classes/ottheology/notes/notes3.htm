Micah 6:8 \n        <ul>\n          <li>This imperative  asks for more than mere obedience, it asks for love. To love implies an insatiable thirst, a  passionate craving. To love means to  transfer the center of one&#x2019;s inner life from the ego to the object of one&#x2019;s  love... the validity of justice and the  motivation for its exercise lie in the blessings it brings to man.&#x201D;\n            --Abraham Heschel, <em>The Prophets</em>, 265</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>What  implications for our closest relationships to &#x201C;do justice and love kindness&#x201D;!  </li>\n      <li>What  would that look like?

Why and for what purpose was Abraham chosen  to become a great and might nation, and to be a blessing to all the nations of  the earth?

God&#x2019;s love and kindness  indicate a road. \n            --Abraham Heschel, <em>The Prophets</em>, 269</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>What  does the imagery of streaming water suggest about justice?

Ezekiel 39:25</li>\n  </ul>\n  <li>Anger  is righteous indignation (Psalm 7:11). \n    <ul>\n      <li>Not to show  partiality is an essential attribute of a judge. But to be impartial to people, one cannot be  impartial to evil. In the Bible, a judge  is not merely a person who has the cognitive faculty to examine a case and  pronounce a sentence; he is also a person who is pained and distressed when  injustice is done. God&#x2019;s concern is the  prerequisite and source of His anger. It is because He cares for man that His  anger may be kindled against man. Anger  and mercy are not opposites but correlatives.  Thus Habakkuk prays, &#x201C;In wrath remember mercy.&#x201D; (Hab. 3:2). Abraham Heschel, <em>The Prophets</em>, 363,4\n        <ul>\n          <li>What  does indifference in the face of evil mean?

See Num. 14:18;  Jer. 15:15; Joel 2:13; Jonah 4:2; Ps. 86:15... </li>\n      <li>Patience  is not apathy, but restraint. But there  is a limit beyond which patience is no longer a blessing or virtue. &#x201C;Severity must tame whom love cannot win.&#x201D;\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Anger  lasts a moment, love endures forever\n    <ul>\n      <ul>\n        <li>I have loved you  with an everlasting love. I have drawn  you with lovingkindness. Again I will  build you and you will be rebuilt. Jeremiah  31:3,4a</li>\n        <li>He does not retain  His anger forever because He delights in unchanging love. Micah 7:18</li>\n        <li>For a brief moment  I forsook you, but with great compassion I will gather you. In overflowing wrath for a moment I hid My  face from you, but with everlasting love I will have compassion on you, says  the Lord, your Redeemer. Isaiah 54:7,8</li>\n      </ul>\n      <li>Respond  to the objection, &#x201C;I simply can not believe that God is all loving and merciful  since he is also full of wrath!&#x201D; What  would you say about a God <em>without</em> wrath? How is wrath reconciled with  mercy and love?</li>\n<li>God&#x2019;s wrath in the  Bible is never the capricious, self-indulgent, irritable, morally ignoble thing  that human anger so often is. It is,  instead, a right and necessary reaction to objective moral evil. God is only angry where anger is called for. --J.I.

Who knows whether He will turn and relent and  leave a blessing behind Him... Joel. 2:11b-14a  </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><em>judgment and contingency</em>: \n    <ul>\n      <li>The word which came  to Jeremiah from the Lord saying, &#x201C;Arise and go down to the potter&#x2019;s house, and  there I will announce My words to you.&#x201D;  Then I went down to the potter&#x2019;s house, and there he was, making  something on the wheel. But the vessel that he was making of clay was spoiled  in the hand of the potter; so he remade it into another vessel, as it pleased  the potter to make. The t word of the  Lord came to me saying, &#x201C;Can I not, O house of Israel, deal with you as the  potter does? Behold, like the clay in  the potter&#x2019;s hand, so are you in My hand, O house of Israel. At one moment I might speak concerning a  nation or concerning a kingdom to uproot, to pull down, or to destroy it; if  that nation against which I have spoken turns form its evil, I will relent  concerning the calamity I planned to bring on it. Or at another moment I might speak concerning  a nation or concerning a kingdom to build up or to plant i; if it does evil in  My sight by not obeying My voice, then I will think better of the good with  which had promised to bless it. So no  then, speak to the men of Judah and against the inhabitants of Jerusalem  saying, &#x2018;thus says the Lord, &#x201C;Behold, I am fashioning calamity against you and  devising a plan against you.

If they are in fact so, we have  a deep problem to grapple with. If on  the other hand they are merely directions which Moses wrongly attributed to  God, or if they are directions such as a later generation thought God ought to  have give to Moses, there is no problem at all.  It is simply a case of fallible men misrepresenting God&#x2014;one more example  of a religious man sincerely believing that by an evil act he was doing God a  service.</p>\n<p> John  Wehham,<em> The Goodness of God</em>, 124</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\"Far off nations.\" Proclaim terms of peace. If they wish to enter into a pact, then leave  them alone.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\"Cities in Canaan.\" These cities are subject to the  \"ban.\" Ban is complete  annihilation. The entire Canaanite  population is to be utterly destroyed. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Why the ban? The ban raises significant questions in the  mind of most readers. Could the God of  grace and mercy really demand such extraordinary measures? It conjures up images of Cambodia under the  Khamir Rouge, and solidifies the impression that the God of the Old Testament  is a wrathful God, in sharp contrast to the God of the New Testament. Let's take a closer look at the legislation  and the Canaanite culture.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Canaanite culture. Canaanite culture, like all of the cultures  of the ANE, centered around its religion.  By all standards of comparison, the Canaanite religion was enormously  dehumanizing.</p>\n\n<p>Molech&#x2019;s outstretched arms:</p>\n\n<p><img width=\"546\" src=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/ottheology/notes/graphics/image004_000.jpg\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n<p>El was the primary god of the Canaanite  pantheon. He is a creator god. Creation occurs by sexual procreation with  female deities. Thus, worship of El  takes on sexual form. Priestesses were  essentially sex slaves of the cult.</p>\n<p>Ba'al or Hadad. Son of El.  He was the head of the Canaanite pantheon. He was younger and more verile than El. He is the god of rain, and therefore, like  El, tied to fertility.</p>\n<p>Annat, wife of Astarti. Very similar to Kali of India. She was the goddess of sex, war and  fertility. She is both sensuous and  dangerous. She is a sacred prostitute  for the gods, terms, \"holy one.\"  Shown riding naked on a lion with a flower in one hand and a serpent in  the other. She delights in blood. A very violent and fickle goddess. Human heads form a necklace in depictions of  her. There was both the practice of  ritual prostitution and human sacrifice to Annat and El.</p>\n<p> Read: John  Bright, <em>A History of Israel</em>, pp.  118,119</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Revelation of God to the  Canaanites. The annihilation of  Canaanite cities occurred after many years of rejecting the revelation God gave  them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Gen. 15:16. God would not give the land to Abraham,  because the \"iniquity of the Amorite was not yet complete.\" That is, they had not, as a culture, gone  beyond the point at which they could respond to God.</p>\n<p>The Canaanites had witnessed the  willingness of God to judge those who resisted him personally on several  occasions. Eg: Destruction of Sodom and  Gomorrah (Gen. 19). Also, Josh. 2:10-14  makes it clear that 40 years prior to it's destruction, Jericho know of God's  deliverance from Egypt. </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Conquest was judgment on the <em>culture</em>.  The intent of the ban was that, \"they might not teach detestable  things\" (Deut. 20:18). It must be  recognized that the failure to complete the conquest set the stage in later  generations, under the era of the judges, for a resurgence of Canaanite  religion, with its devastating consequences for Israel. (see Judges 2:1-3, 10-15, 19-23).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Judgment on a culture is not the same  as God's eternal judgment on all of the individuals within the society. Those who were unable to  make moral choices or comprehend what the  culture stood for would not be held accountable before God (see 2 Sam. 12:22).</li>\n  <li>While God used the Hebrews as his  instrument in judging the Canaanites, it does not follow that the Hebrews are  characterized as meriting the land (Deut. 7:7-11). The land was given simply because God is  faithful to his promises.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>God does not delight in the destruction  of any person or culture. He executes  temporal judgment only when his greater redemptive plan requires it. See, for example Jonah 4:4-11.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Judgments in the Old Testament are  temporal</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>A final  reflection:</p>\n\n<p>No doubt it is true  that the subject of divine wrath has in the past been handled speculatively,  irreverently, even malevolently. No  doubt there have been some who have preached of the wrath and damnation with  tearless eyes and no pain in their hearts.  No doubt the sights of small sects cheerfully consigning the world,  apart from themselves, to hell has disgusted many. Yet, if we would know God, it is vital that  we face the truth concerning his wrath, however unfashionable it may be, and  however strong our initial prejudices against it. Otherwise we shall not understand the gospel  of salvation from wrath, nor the propitiatory achievement of the cross, nor the  wonder of the redeeming love of God. Nor  shall we understand the hand of God in history and God&#x2019;s present dealings with  our own people... nor will our evangelism have the urgency enjoined by  Jude&#x2014;&#x201C;same some, by snatching them out of the fire&#x201D; (Jude 23). Neither our knowledge of God nor our service  to him will be in accord with his Word. </p>\n<p> J.I.

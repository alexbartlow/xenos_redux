Is it easy to keep the horror of wickedness  from turning into a hatred of the wicked?  The world is drenched in blood, and the guilt is endless. Should not all hope be abandoned? What saved the prophets from despair was  their messianic vision and the idea of man&#x2019;s capacity for repentance... The God  of Israel is also the God of her enemies, without their knowing Him and despite  their defying Him. The enmity between  the nations will turn to friendship &#x201C;in that day.&#x201D; -- Abraham  Heschel, <em>The  Prophets</em>, 236,237</li>\n          <li>No longer is the exodus the private tradition  of Israel alone: it becomes the symbolic form through which a <u>messianic  movement</u> is envisaged. Egypt, the  first oppressor of Israel, will one day have its share in an &#x201C;exodus&#x201D;-type  event.... Isaiah pushed the language of cultural memory to the limit of its  innermost possibilities. This is acutely  felt in 19:25, where Egypt is called &#x201C;My people.&#x201D; In fact, such a transfer of a designation  used pointedly of Israel (Exodus 3:10) weighed heavily on ancient Jewish translators. Unable to tolerate such a theological  paradox, the Septuagint and Targum traditions  renationalized the text and substituted Israel for Egypt.

Hosea 11:1</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><em>key interpretative questions:</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>How  does Matthew understand Hosea 11:1 to be <em>fulfilled</em> in Jesus&#x2019; family&#x2019;s flight to Egypt? How  is Hosea&#x2019;s text legitimately messianic?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Is  Matthew&#x2019;s use of Hosea consistent with the prophet&#x2019;s own interpretative  approach to Exodus 4:22 and Numbers 24:8?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p><em>Observations from Hosea</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Context</em> of  Hosea 11 within the flow of the book</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Hosea 11 is one of the three  major oracles of hope after God&#x2019;s case against Israel is declared (4:1). In contrast to Israel&#x2019;s unfaithfulness and  the exile to which they will go, God cares for and will <em>preserve</em> Israel (6:1&#x2014;3; 11:1&#x2014;11; 14:1&#x2014;9).</p>\n\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Informing theology:</em> &#x201C;My son.&#x201D;  Israel as God&#x2019;s son was an accepted technical term (Exod. 4:22,23; Num.  24:8). The many were represented by the  singular, &#x201C;son.&#x201D; And the one  representing the many is an established messianic term (2 Samuel 7:14; Psalm  2:7; Isaiah 9:6). </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Prophetic concept of history:</em> Hosea uses Israel&#x2019;s departure from Egypt as a  reminder of God&#x2019;s <em>ongoing exodus hope</em> for his people (Isaiah 11;11) through the Davidic King (Isaiah 11:1&#x2014;5). </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For Hosea, Egypt is synonymous  with Assyria (metonymic parallelism 9:3; see Ps. 114:1&#x2014;3). Egypt is thus a <em>symbol</em> of bondage (8;13; 9:3, 6; 11:3&#x2014;5; 12:13). See also Rev. 11:8.</p>\n\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Hosea&#x2019;s prophetic message:</em> Consistent with the prophetic understanding of  history, Israel&#x2019;s hope, rooted in the historic past, will look to the future  exodus of God from the current &#x201C;Egypt.&#x201D; <em>The past overflows into the future as  history fulfills God&#x2019;s redemption. </em>And by invoking the <em>part </em>of the motif that fits the situation, the <em>entire</em> meaning of the motif is presumed by the author. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matthew 2 and the use of Hosea 11:1</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Matthew  looks to the exodus theme as it unfolds in the prophets, using exactly the same  view of history:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Just as under Moses God  preserved his <em>son</em> in Egypt and  &#x201C;called out my son,&#x201D; so, Hosea declares, he will again under Assyrian (Egypt)  captivity with a new exodus. In Matthew,  as Son in the<em> fullest</em> sense, Jesus  completes (pleroo) the motif&#x2014;as his ministry also  bears witness. As Hosea fits into the  broader prophetic motif of exodus, which includes an explicit messianic  dimension (Isaiah 11; Jeremiah 23), Matthew is invoking that part of the motif  that fits the situation he is describing in the Gospel narrative of Jesus. But by invoking part of the motif, the  assumption is that it carries the breadth of the motif&#x2019;s meaning. </p>\n\n<p>Both Hosea and Matthew  understand that God preserves his &#x201C;son&#x201D; in &#x201C;Egypt&#x201D; and anticipates the time  when the Lord will &#x201C;call out my son.&#x201D; In  this sense Matthew uses Hosea 11 in the <em>same</em> sense Hosea used Exodus 4 and Numbers 24. </p>\n\n\n<p>No rabbinic approach such as <em>midrash</em> or <em>pesher</em><em>,</em> or the Roman Catholic doctrine of <em>sensus</em><em> plenior </em>need be  assumed, but a consistent exegetical approach by both Hosea and Matthew. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"notes4","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/ottheology/notes/notes4.htm"}

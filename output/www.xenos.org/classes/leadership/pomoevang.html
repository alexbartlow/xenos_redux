Then try another comment. Teach people to <i><b>ask questions in \n  return</b></i>, rather than always trying to answer questions. This exercise \n  works best after a 2 to 4 week study of postmodern thought and presuppositions. \n  Alternatively, analyze and assess the presuppositions underlying each statement.</p>\n<table width=\"706\" border=\"0\">\n  <tr> \n    <td width=\"333\"><b>\"I can't believe you Christians \n      think everyone needs to be converted except you!\"</b></td>\n    <td width=\"363\"><b>\"Do you, or do you not believe Islam \n      is a valid faith in its own right?\"</b></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr> \n    <td width=\"333\"><b>\"How can you, being a Westerner, pass \n      judgment on a culture far older than your own?\"</b></td>\n    <td width=\"363\"><b>\"Nothing is more disrespectful to a \n      culture than a foreign missionary coming in to tell them they have it all \n      wrong.\"</b></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr> \n    <td width=\"333\"><b>\"Are you one of those Christians who \n      believe that if someone doesn't receive Christ he goes to hell?\" \n      </b></td>\n    <td width=\"363\"><b>\"I'm a Christian, but I also think \n      Buddhism has a lot to offer.\" </b></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr> \n    <td width=\"333\"><b>\"Every religion thinks it's right \n      and the others are wrong.

Yet\n  most of us struggle to some degree with fear of rejection when we think about\n  sharing our faith.&#xA0; This may be the biggest barrier that we face!&#xA0; Timothy\n  was a fearful, yet effective minister for Christ.&#xA0; Paul wrote to Timothy to\n  offer encouragement: </p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">2 Timothy 1:7,8 &#xA0;&#x201C;<span>For\n    God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline.&#xA0; Therefore\n    do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, or of me His prisoner; but\n    join with </span>me<span> in suffering for\n    the gospel according to the power of God&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#x201D;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Key points from\n    this passage that you should discuss in your group include:</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span>God&#x2019;s part</span></b><span>: Paul directs\n    Timothy to God&#x2019;s part in evangelism (&#x201C;power and love and discipline. . .\n    according to the power of God. . .&#x201D;).&#xA0; To cultivate boldness, we must know\n    and focus on what God promises to do in this area.&#xA0; God&#x2019;s power is manifest\n    in evangelism in four ways:</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&#xB7;</span><span>He\n    DRAWS people to seek God</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&#xB7;</span><span>He\n    CONNECTS us with seekers</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&#xB7;</span><span>He\n    EMPOWERS us as we witness</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&#xB7;</span><span>He\n    CONVICTS people after we witness</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Share\n    the scriptures that teach these truths.&#xA0; Discuss how you have experienced\n    God&#x2019;s part in evangelism in your own life.</span></p>\n<p class=\"LevelB\"><b>Our part</b>: Paul also calls on Timothy to do his\n  part (&#x201C;do not be ashamed of the testimony. . . join with me in suffering for\n  the gospel.&#x201D;).&#xA0; We need to express our trust that God will do his part by actually\n  stepping out in faith to be his witnesses! &#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Sometimes we feel\n    that it will take a long time to regain our confidence in evangelism, but\n    reaffirming God&#x2019;s part and stepping out in faith will usually produce an\n    immediate increase in confidence.&#xA0; The following sections are meant to be\n    covered in a cell group or workers&#x2019; meeting format.&#xA0; You will probably need\n    two weeks to cover this material.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Questions\n    that may initiate Spiritual Conversations </b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Many people are willing to talk about spiritual matters,\n  but only rarely will they initiate a spiritual conversation with you.&#xA0; One\n  way we can provide them with this opportunity is to ask spiritual questions.&#xA0; Here\n  are some interesting and thought-provoking questions that could help you start\n  a spiritual conversation.&#xA0; We are not suggesting a formula; each of these should\n  be put in your own words so that you speak from your heart.&#xA0; Remember that\n  your goal is not necessarily to share the gospel in this conversation, but\n  to make the person more comfortable discussing spiritual things&#x2014;which will\n  likely lead to further discussions.&#xA0; Discuss these ideas in your cell group\n  and consider other ways to pose the questions to get at the same spiritual\n  issue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">1.<u>&#x201C;Do you\n    have any type of spiritual belief</u>?&#x201D;&#xA0; OR &#x201C;<u>Do you have a spiritual\n    category for that</u>?&#x201D;&#xA0; Through this type of question we learn what they\n    believe.&#xA0; The most important thing to do is to <i>listen carefully </i>and\n    ask follow-up questions.&#xA0; &#xA0; Often you get \"I'm a Catholic, Methodist,\n    etc\" response.&#xA0; &#xA0;You could then ask them, &#x201C;What was you&#x2019;re your\n    experience like growing up Catholic?&#x201D;&#xA0; <br>\n  <br>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">2.<u>\"What\n    kind of spiritual background/church did you have growing up?\"</u>&#xA0; This\n    may be an easier question to pursue with some people than #1.&#xA0; Most people\n    are willing to answer it because it simply asks for historical information\n    and does not call on them to take a position on a system of belief.<br>\n  <br>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">3.<u>&#x201C;If you\n    died this week, where would you go</u>?&#x201D; OR &#x201C;<u>What do you think happens\n    to people when they die?&#x201D;</u>&#xA0; &#xA0;Discussions about the afterlife are\n    often very helpful.&#xA0; Consider following up this question with,&#xA0; &#x201C;<u>Why\n    do you think you would go there</u>?&#x201D;&#xA0;<br>\n  <br>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">4.<u>&#x201C;If what\n    you believe is&#xA0;not true, would you&#xA0;want to know</u>?&#x201D;&#xA0; &#xA0;Through\n    this question we can find whether they are ready to take a new step.&#xA0; Those\n    who have experience asking this question have found that most people answer\n    &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; and are open.&#xA0; If the individual says, &#x201C;No,&#x201D; we need to carefully read\n    their response and decide whether to ask them why, or simply move to a different\n    subject.&#xA0; </p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">5.<u>&#x201C;Would\n    you mind if I shared something that someone told me</u>?&#x201D;&#xA0;OR &#x201C;<u>Is\n    it ok if I tell you about my spiritual beliefs?&#x201D;</u>&#xA0; If they don&#x2019;t want\n    to pursue this, let it go.&#xA0; But if they are open, you can proceed with the\n    gospel.&#xA0; Always use scripture and if possible open your Bible and allow\n    them to read the scripture you refer to.&#xA0; The paper <i>The Logic of Salvation </i>(<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/logic.htm\">http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\">/logic.htm</span></a>) provides an excellent framework\n  for presenting the Gospel.<br>\n  <br>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">6.<u>&#x201C;Who\n    do you think (believe) Jesus is(was)?</u>&#x201D; &#xA0;If Jesus comes up in the discussion,\n    then this type of question can be very helpful. &#xA0;This is another way to get\n    to the Gospel as you describe the unique person and mission of Jesus.<br>\n  <br>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">7.<u>\"What\n    kind of evidence would it take for you to be willing to invite Jesus into\n    your heart?\"</u>People\n    often don't know how to answer this question--but that in itself may help\n    them.&#xA0; It also gives the asker the opportunity to share how much evidence\n    they had before they asked Christ--and what happened when they did.<br>\n  <br>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">8.<u>&#x201C;Do you\n    ever pray?&#x201D;</u> OR <u>&#x201C;Would you be willing to pray about what we&#x2019;ve been\n    discussing?&#x201D;</u> &#xA0;If they say, &#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; encourage them to simply call out to\n    God and ask that he reveal himself.&#xA0; You might share John 7:17, &#x201C;If any man\n    is willing to do His will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of\n    God, or whether I speak from Myself.&#x201D;<br>\n  <br>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">9.<u>&#x201C;Would\n    it be ok with you if I pray for you right now?</u>&#x201D;&#xA0; This will open the door\n    for you to bring God into the situation and demonstrate a personal prayer.&#xA0; In\n    your prayer you can take their personal questions or concerns to God.&#xA0; You\n    will be amazed how often non-Christians are deeply moved by this type of\n    personal prayer in their presence.&#xA0; Consider asking them if they would like\n    to pray aloud (or silently) with you.&#xA0; <br>\n  <br>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">10.<u>&#x201C;What do you want to accomplish\n    in life?&#x201D;</u> OR &#x201C;<u>What is the purpose of life (or a specific part of your\n    life)?</u>&#x201D; &#xA0;These questions get at the issue of life purpose which is a\n    hot topic today.&#xA0; The fact the Rich Warren&#x2019;s <i>Purpose Driven Life</i> is\n    a New York Times Best Seller demonstrates that people are considering this\n    issue.&#xA0; You might consider suggesting that your friend read this book.<u><br>\n</u>&#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Questions like these will prime the pump, but we must\n  be good listeners to establish good conversations.&#xA0; In James 1:19 we read,\n  &#x201C;This you know, my beloved brethren. But let everyone be <i>quick to hear,\n  slow to speak</i> and slow to anger. . .&#x201D;&#xA0; Good listeners often find receptivity\n  to their point of view since they show concern and respect for the other person.\n  [See Watchman Nee. <i>Character of God's Workman</i>. Chapter on Listening].</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Exercise:</b><br>\n  After discussing these questions in the group, have each person take about\n    fifteen minutes to prayerfully consider the content in view of their non-Christian\n    friends.&#xA0;&#xA0; Then they should determine how they would put the content in their\n    own words and write out a few questions.&#xA0; They could share these with the\n    group or you could break up into groups of three or four to share their questions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><br>\n  From Chit-chat to the Gospel</b></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br>\n  Common conversation provides many opportunities to explore spiritual issues.&#xA0; Some\n  of us have the misconception that a deep personal relationship is needed to\n  discuss spiritual things.&#xA0; As a result, we have spiritual conversations with\n  non-Christians only rarely&#x2014;and little evangelistic fruit.&#xA0; Many of us need\n  to be more open about our spiritual interests in casual conversations so we\n  have opportunities to find receptive people.&#xA0; When it comes right down to it,\n  most adults are so busy that it&#x2019;s very difficult to build a close friendship\n  outside the church.&#xA0; If we wait to get close to someone before we mention spiritual\n  issues, we won&#x2019;t be discussing spiritual issues very often.&#xA0; </p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We need to be willing to talk as naturally and openly\n  about our relationship with Christ as we would any other important aspect of\n  our lives.&#xA0; This paper provides a few suggestions for how we can apply this\n  principle.&#xA0; <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Review these in your cell group and with each discuss other ideas for the\n  particular situation.&#xA0; Encourage each member to think of how they could apply\n  these ideas to their situation.</i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Responses to common questions:</b></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Creative responses test for spiritual interest.&#xA0; We\n  need to be positive, open, and enthusiastic about our spiritual life.&#xA0; Most\n  of us fear that people will think we&#x2019;re some kind of nut if we are enthusiastic\n  about the Lord, but we need to put that fear behind us and not be so inhibited.&#xA0; Here\n  are a few examples of responses to common questions:</p>\n\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\" class=\"style1\">\n  <li class=\"MsoNormal\">What have been up to lately?&#xA0; What&#x2019;s goin&#x2019; on?</li>\n  <ol start=\"1\" type=\"a\">\n    <li class=\"MsoNormal\">I&#x2019;m learning some great things in this Bible study I&#x2019;ve\n      been attending.</li>\n    <li class=\"MsoNormal\">Discuss recent spiritual insights.&#xA0; EG:</li>\n  </ol>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&#xB7;</span>Our\n  marriage is making some progress thanks to what I&#x2019;m learning from the Bible.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&#xB7;</span>I&#x2019;ve\n  had a major breakthrough in my life since I&#x2019;ve learned about God&#x2019;s forgiveness.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&#xB7;</span>I&#x2019;m\n  getting some control over my anger thanks to God and a few good friends.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&#xB7;</span>My\n  wife and I have some really good friends that we&#x2019;ve made through our church.&#xA0; It&#x2019;s\n  made our family life a lot better.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\" type=\"1\" class=\"style1\">\n  <li class=\"MsoNormal\">How&#x2019;s the family?&#xA0; The patent answer is &#x201C;Great. . .&#x201D;&#xA0; &#x201C;John\n    is playing soccer.&#xA0; Beth got a scholarship to Harvard.&#xA0; Albert is going to\n    OSU.&#x201D;&#xA0; People put their best foot forward.&#xA0; Where&#x2019;s the reality of family\n    life?</li>\n  <ol start=\"1\" type=\"a\">\n    <li class=\"MsoNormal\">We&#x2019;re doing ok, but it&#x2019;s been a real struggle for me\n      trying to learn how to parent.&#xA0; Why don&#x2019;t they send an owner&#x2019;s manual with\n      these kids?</li>\n    <li class=\"MsoNormal\">We&#x2019;re struggling in our marriage, but thanks to a few\n      good friends and God&#x2019;s help we&#x2019;re making some progress.</li>\n    <li class=\"MsoNormal\">I&#x2019;ve made some big mistakes financially and now we&#x2019;re\n      working hard to get out from under it.&#xA0; I&#x2019;ve been studying the Bible and\n      getting God&#x2019;s perspective on my money, so I believe there&#x2019;s hope. </li>\n  </ol>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Responses like these will\n  disarm people and open many doors to spiritual conversation.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\" type=\"1\" class=\"style1\">\n  <li class=\"MsoNormal\">What are you doing this weekend?&#xA0; <br>\n    Don&#x2019;t be afraid to discuss the spiritual things we pursue?</li>\n  <ol start=\"1\" type=\"a\">\n    <li class=\"MsoNormal\">Sunday I&#x2019;m going to our church.&#xA0; I don&#x2019;t like to miss\n      that because I learn something about every week that&#x2019;s helpful.</li>\n    <li class=\"MsoNormal\">We&#x2019;re going camping with a group of friends from our\n      church.&#xA0; We&#x2019;ve gotten to be really close over the years and it&#x2019;s a great\n      experience.</li>\n  </ol>\n</ol>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Initiating Natural Conversation about Spiritual\n    Issues</b></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Besides responding to these basic questions as we&#x2019;ve\n  discussed above, we should also open and forthright about their relationship\n  with God.&#xA0; We need to be willing to discuss our relationship with God like\n  we would other things in our life that we&#x2019;re excited about.&#xA0; For example, if\n  you attended a great concert, you would naturally and enthusiastically tell\n  your friends and co-workers about it.&#xA0; In the same way we need to be open about\n  the excitement that comes from faithfully following Christ.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Consider the way God is\n    personally affecting you and think how you could introduce the topic into\n    conversation</b>.&#xA0; These may be areas that we find encouraging and exciting,\n    but on the other hand challenging and perplexing issues can and sometimes\n    should be discussed with our non-Christian friends.&#xA0; Examples: </p>\n<ul type=\"disc\" class=\"style1\">\n  <li class=\"MsoNormal\">I&#x2019;ve been experiencing God&#x2019;s peace when I used to be overwhelmed\n    with anxiety.</li>\n  <li class=\"MsoNormal\">I just can&#x2019;t get over how wonderful it is to have Christian\n    friends who show me God&#x2019;s love.</li>\n  <li class=\"MsoNormal\">Parenting has been very difficult lately and the hardships\n    have made me wrestle with God&#x2019;s faithfulness in my life.</li>\n  <li class=\"MsoNormal\">I&#x2019;ve been perplexed as I&#x2019;ve tried to figure out God&#x2019;s will\n    for my career.&#xA0; </li>\n  <li class=\"MsoNormal\">My wife and I are realizing that we could relate a lot\n    better if we prayed together more often.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Reading their response</b></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Reading responses in conversation takes a lot of experience\n  and there&#x2019;s no real formula to follow, but these guidelines will be helpful\n  to consider:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&#xB7;</span>If\n  they express interest in spiritual things then feel free to share more, including\n  the gospel and/or inviting them to an event or Bible study. &#xA0;Consider inviting\n  them to study the Bible with you one-on-one too.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&#xB7;</span>If\n  they respond negatively, this is <i>a great opportunity</i> to understand why\n  they are negative about what you shared.&#xA0; Ask questions to identify the source\n  of their negativity: previous bad experiences, misconceptions, etc.&#xA0; This will\n  provide an opportunity for you to share the difference between biblical Christianity\n  and their misconceptions.&#xA0; </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&#xB7;</span>If\n  they have no response, we should not push at this point, but remain confident\n  that because God is at work our friend may be open to future spiritual conversations.&#xA0; You\n  will probably feel more confident to discuss spiritual issues in the future.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Return to Introduction to\n      Christian Leadership</a></p>\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/graphics/navldr.jpg","title":"2 Timothy 1:7,8 For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of\npower and love and discipline","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/evangelismWorkshop1-Initiating.htm"}

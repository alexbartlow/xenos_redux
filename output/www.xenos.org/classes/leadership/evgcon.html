Through Home Church and Cell Group, instruct\n                your people on the biblical basis for evangelism (without neglecting\n                other areas of doctrine). List several truths that require solid\n                convictions in order for a biblical basis to be built. Include\n                the antithesis: that a group without evangelism is doomed--not\n                this week or this month, but eventually, this is a problem the\n                group <i>must</i> solve together. Agree together that there will\n                be no complacency in your group--you must see a harvest!</p>\n            <p>2. Check to see if there are past guests who have\n                been neglected. If so, how can this be corrected? Cold medium\n                outreach requires very careful management of a follow up list,\n                as we can't afford to miss any opportunity. We will discuss <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/hcfoll.htm\">follow\n                up</a> later.</p>\n            <p>3. The leadership has to be the first to witness.\n                It isn't important that leaders succeed, only that they try,\n                and can recount their attempts to the rest of the church.</p>\n            <p>4. If possible, allow your disciple(s) to accompany\n                you when you witness. This gives them the opportunity to learn\n                by example (I Cor. 4:16; 11:1). Even if you don't get to witness,\n                the act of going out to a venue where you can meet people will\n                be positive.</p>\n            <p>5. Evangelism is sometimes hazardous and difficult\n                work. Are your people being helped, praised, and encouraged for\n                all of their outreach attempts, even if unsuccessful? See Paul's\n                application of this principle in I Thes. 1.</p>\n            <p>6. You and your people should share your witnessing\n                experiences with each other and pray for each other in specific\n                cases of outreach.</p>\n            <p>7. If someone gets a chance to witness, be sure\n                to celebrate that answer to prayer privately and publicly. Come\n                back to that case in subsequent weeks and ask if anything else\n                has happened.</p>\n            <p>8. Find ways to role-play bringing the gospel\n                up with people, such as Pippert's questions to use in evangelism: \n            </p><ul>\n              <ul>\n                <p>\"How have your impressions of God changed\n                    over the past few years?\"</p>\n                <p>\"What is your impression of people who\n                    call themselves Christians?\"</p>\n                <p>or my suggestion:</p>\n                <p>\"Would you consider yourself a spiritual\n                    person?\" </p>\n                <p>followed by either \"Why not?\" or \"What\n                    does that mean to you?\"</p>\n                <p>or this suggestion from Neil Cole:</p>\n                <p>First engage in conversation, looking for\n                    insight into the other person on one of three things: 1)\n                    his pain 2)his passion 3)his purpose. If you are successful\n                    in uncovering information on any of these, ask if you can\n                    pray for the person. (They usually say \"yes.\")\n                    Then, pray for them, there and then! Cole says they usually\n                    do this with a hand on their shoulder. Offer a short personal\n                    prayer and end it. The assumption is that by saying yes,\n                    the person has authorized God to become involved. By being\n                    in the presence of a praying Christian, they will witness\n                    how a personal relationship with God works, and also will\n                    be impacted directly by the Holy Spirit. These cases usually\n                    lead to subsequent opportunities to share more, and are also\n                    usually appreciated by the person.</p>\n                <p>or Fay's Jesus questions:</p>\n                <p>1. Do you have any spiritual beliefs?</p>\n                <p>2. Who is Jesus to you?</p>\n                <p>3. Do you believe in a heaven or hell?</p>\n                <p>4. Where would you go if you died? Why?</p>\n                <p>5. If what you believe were wrong, would you\n                    want to know?</p>\n              </ul>\n            </ul>\n            <p>9. Another strategy in cold medium witnessing\n                is to begin by building warm relationships with non-Christians.\n                See teaching material on the subject of building new friendships,\n                such as that in <i>Organic Disciple Making</i>, by McCallum and\n                Lowery. However, you should <em>never view this as a necessary\n                prerequisite </em>                for evangelism. Always be prepared\n                to share the gospel early in a relationship.</p>\n            <p>10. Teach your people to ask questions. We typically\n                find Christians making the mistake of thinking that the important\n                thing is knowing what to say. We need to convince them that even\n                more important is knowing how to listen. See Fay's \"Hmmm principle,\"\n                where he never says anything but \"Hmmm\" to people's answers\n                to his questions (<em>Share Jesus Without Fear</em>). Learning\n                about a person's perspective and past may powerfully affect how\n                we\n                witness.\n                Find\n                out what, if any, church background the person had, and their\n                attitude toward it. Teach on different levels of conversation\n                wherein different questions become appropriate:\n            </p><ul>\n              <ul>\n                <p>a. General- what do you major in?</p>\n                <p>b. Specific- what area of art are you most\n                    interested in?</p>\n                <p>c. Abstract<br>\n                  - Why do you think people have the ability to enjoy beauty? <br>\n                  -Could a machine enjoy beauty?<br>\n                  -What is the source of beauty? <br>\n                  -I've always worried that it might be lonely living alone<br>\n                  -Do you think there's such a thing as real love?</p>\n                <p>d. Theological<br>\n                  - what do you think of when you think of God?<br>\n                  -Why do you think there is evil in the world?<br>\n                  -Do you think there is an afterlife?</p>\n              </ul>\n            </ul>\n            <p>11. Don't make the mistake of thinking cold medium\n                evangelism won't work. The key here is to realize that some people\n                are effective in a cold medium situation, while others are less\n                so. The leader has the job of \"equipping the saints for\n                service,\" (Eph.4:12) which includes  helping members succeed\n                in different kinds of evangelism.</p>\n            <p>12. Activities can be planned where cold medium\n                outreach might occur. We need a certain level of stimulation\n                at such events in order to hold the interest of secular visitors. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc1.htm\">Conversation\n                and Cuisine</a>, Mom's Playgroups and evangelistic parties have\n                all been used at Xenos with good results.</p>\n            <p>13. Don't assume that only certain temperament\n                types can do cold medium communication. Leaders are regularly\n                surprised to find that the one bringing in a new person is the\n                one they thought would be unable.</p>\n            <p>14. During your campaign, regular, objective feedback\n                is usually sufficient to raise the tension in the home church.\n                Don't overlook any answers to prayer, but don't exaggerate success\n                either. \"Since we began praying about this, God has granted\n                us three different opportunities to share with non Christians.\n                However, we still haven't seen anyone new at home church.\" Remember\n                that what a group talks about is what they tend to do. Make it\n                a point to bring this subject up with such regularity (both in\n                group and individual situations) that people realize the issue\n                won't go away, and has to be solved.</p>\n          </ul>\n        </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Leading Home Church Evangelism","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/evgcon.html"}

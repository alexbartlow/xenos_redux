(This \n    is the \"little leaven leavening the whole lump\" in 1 Cor. 5). It \n    can also result in a build-up of frustration and anger within the group when \n    members see their friends being exploited. Such built-up anger can result \n    in destructive outbursts when people lose self-control.<br>\n    <br>\n    </li>\n  <li>Study the following passages and determine what each teaches \n    on the subject of church discipline.

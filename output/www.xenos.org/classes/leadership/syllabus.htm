That means you will assemble a notebook\n  as the course unfolds, and the quality of that notebook, along with your\n  attendance and participation, will determine your grade for the course. The\n  notebook will become a tool for your use as a Christian leader, so it is\n  important that it be referenced and neat. There should be dividers by subject.\n  The writing or typing should be neat and readable, and you should include\n  your reading assignments, your class notes, any handouts, or other research.\n  The notebook should become a resource you can turn to for ideas and direction\n  in future years as you lead. We will examine the notebooks at the midway\n  point in the class and provide you any feedback you need on your work to\n  date. At the end of the class, the notebooks are due, and will be graded\n  like a final exam. Be sure you keep up with the reading schedule, because\n  you will need the reading to participate in class.</p>\n<h2>Reading:</h2>\n<p class=\"style1\"><b>Read and assess Dennis McCallum and Jessica Lowery, <em>Organic Disciplemaking</em><i>,</i> according\n  to schedule below. The assigned questions are answered and the answers are\n  put into your notebook under assignments. They are not handed in until the\n  notebook is handed in.</b> <strong>Even if this is your second time through the book, I believe this much material cannot be retained on one reading. You will probably find yourself getting more from the second reading than you did the first. For those who feel they are completely versed in Organic Disciplemaking, you may substitute Greg Ogden, Transforming Discipleship. </strong></p>\n<p><b>Week 1 <a name=\"week1\"></a></b></p>\n<h2><b>Group leadership: The theology of leadership</b></h2>\n<blockquote>\n  <h3><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/classgoals.htm\">Class Goals</a></b></h3>\n  <h3><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/groupneedleaders.htm\">Do groups really need human leaders? </a></b></h3>\n  <h3><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/godmin.html\">God's part in ministry</a> </b></h3>\n  <h3><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/whatmakesleader.htm\"><b>What makes a person a leader?</b></a></h3>\n  <h3><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/11leaders.html\"><b>What is a Christian leader?</b></a></h3>\n  <h3>Assignment: Read<b><em>Organic Disciplemaking</em></b><em> P. 13-44. </em> and answer these questions.

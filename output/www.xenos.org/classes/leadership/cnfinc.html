The tithe \n      was a tax levied on Israelites which supported the Levites. There is no \n      evidence that it was prescribed for Christians. However, it is not wrong \n      to suggest ten per cent as a rule of thumb for what consistent and significant \n      giving means. We would also hope that because grace produces a righteousness \n      superior to that produced by law, giving under grace will also exceed giving \n      mandated by law.</p>\n    <p>2. Collections should be done with sensitivity to the non-Christian \n      (2&#xA0;Cor. 2:17; 2&#xA0;Thes. 3:7-9; 1&#xA0;Cor. 9:12). NonChristians \n      are often suspicious about collections because of the existence of so many \n      religious charlatans and hucksters. When collections are taken with nonChristians \n      present, we should make it clear that giving is an opportunity for Christians \n      to thank and serve God, and that we do not want our guests to feel obligated \n      in any way to give. We should also periodically publicly articulate key \n      <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/aboutxenos/strange.htm#elderlimit\">Xenos financial policies</a> \n      designed to decrease suspicion. At the same time, we should be frank unapologetic \n      with nonChristian guests that giving is an important part of Christian living.</p>\n    <p>3. Collections should be done in a regular and orderly \n      manner (1&#xA0;Cor.&#xA0;16:1-3). We should facilitate consistent individual \n      giving by reminding members in a variety of ways, including taking collections \n      on a regular basis. We should view this as no different than calls to pray \n      or witness.</p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>a.<i> Out of gratitude for what God has given us through \n        Christ.</i> The image of giving ourselves as a thank-offering in response \n        to God's grace is cited in Rom.&#xA0;12:1. Notice that this same image \n        is applied specifically to giving money to support God's work in Phil.&#xA0;4:18. \n        This seems to be the primary motivation taught in the Bible.</p>\n      <p>b. <i>To \n        meet real needs in the name of Christ.</i> In Phil.&#xA0;4:16, Paul says \n        that their financial giving to his missionary work has met his needs. \n        Similarly, in 2&#xA0;Cor.&#xA0;9:12, Paul says that the Corinthians' financial \n        giving was \"fully supplying the needs of the saints.\" In a very \n        real way, God transmutes the money that we give to the church into ministry \n        which meets peoples needs. </p>\n      <p>c.<i> To experience eternal reward. </i>In<i> </i>Phil. \n        4:17, Paul says he wants them to give, not simply so that he may receive \n        their money, but so that they experience \"profit in their account.\" \n        This probably refers to the reward that they will receive at the judgment-seat \n        of Christ, when he evaluates our service for him as Christians (1&#xA0;Cor.&#xA0;3:10-15). \n        In a very real way, we are making an investment in our own eternal futures \n        when we give our money to God's work. This is one very practical way to \n        \"lay up treasure in heaven\" (Matt.&#xA0;6:20).</p>\n      <p>d.<i> As a way of experiencing God's faithfulness to \n        provide for our material needs.</i> Phil.&#xA0;4:19 makes the promise \n        that as we give to support God's work, he will care for our material needs. \n        Many passages teach this (Matt.&#xA0;6:33; 2&#xA0;Cor.&#xA0;9:8,10). God \n        invites us to learn experientially about this exciting aspect of his loving \n        care for us as we give in this way. Stated differently, it is not possible \n        to say that we are trusting God with our finances unless we are giving \n        significantly and consistently of our money to his work.</p>\n      <p>e.<i> To increase our commitment to God.</i> In Lk.&#xA0;12:33,34, \n        Jesus urges us to give of our money to help the poor because \"where \n        your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\" This passage is \n        not saying that our giving is an index of our commitment (though this \n        is often true), but rather that our giving affects our level of interest \n        and commitment to God. If we invest in stocks, our interest in, and commitment \n        to, that company will increase. The more we invest in God's work, the \n        more our interest in and commitment to God will increase.</p>\n      <p>f.<i> To be morally responsible.</i> Several passages \n        teach that because we receive spiritual benefit from God's servants, we \n        are responsible to minister to their material needs. Rom.&#xA0;15:27 teaches \n        this principle and applies it extra-locally (Gentile Christians should \n        acknowledge their spiritual \"debt\" to Jewish Christians); Gal.&#xA0;6:6 \n        applies it locally (those taught should share materially with those who \n        teach). 1&#xA0;Tim.&#xA0;5:17,18 applies it to elders. 1&#xA0;Cor.&#xA0;9:4-11 \n        applies it to paying apostles. Many of us have wrongly dichotomized the \n        idea of grace-motivation with this complementary truth that such giving \n        is a moral obligation. Certainly, we should be able to render to God what \n        is his, and do it with an attitude of thanksgiving because he is so good \n        to us (2 Cor. 8:9 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that \n        though He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, that you through \n        His poverty might become rich.).</p>\n      <p>g. <i>To prevent our mission from failing</i>. Our history \n        as a church shows that all our efforts can be blocked completely by widespread \n        failure to give sacrificially. Every ministry needs funding, and We are \n        no different. In this connection, we should take notice of members who \n        give, but only to ministries other than Xenos. This unusual, but known \n        practice clearly suggests lack of confidence in our ministry, or possible \n        hostility and disunity, which needs to be resolved.</p>\n      <p>h. <i>To avoid having God remove \n        us from ministry</i>. Jesus said if we can't be trusted in the use of \n        a little thing like money, who will trust us with the true riches of the \n        kingdom of God? (Luke 16) According to this passage, unless we become \n        faithful stewards, God will not trust us with leadership in the church.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"New Testament Principles of Church Finance","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/cnfinc.html"}

Leaders who are not living by such a standard \n        should be criticized to their face, rather than behind their back, and \n        challenged to step up.</li>\n      <li>If you feel you must offer criticism to a fellow leader, \n        your perception of any shortcomings on the part of other leaders should \n        be objective, and serious. Avoid picking at each other for unimportant \n        issues, which leads to a critical atmosphere.</li>\n      <li>Observing the principle of the \"man on the Spot\". \n        <blockquote> \n          <p>1) You should exercise extreme caution when you encounter \n            negative thoughts regarding another leader's ministry work, especially \n            if that work is carried on outside of your own cell. This is because \n            the man (or woman) on the spot is the one who is usually best able \n            to judge what is happening.<br>\n            <br>\n            The value of other leaders in this situation is mainly that of questioning \n            the situation, rather than defining it. In other words, by a questioning \n            process, the other leaders should bring out any doubts that they have \n            about the ministry of the one on the spot. However, if the answers \n            given are sensible and correspond with objective fact, they should \n            be believed. Also, if a leader contradicts an account given by a member, \n            we should be disposed to believe the leader over the member, according \n            to I Timothy 5:19. However, the passage is actually about elders, \n            and besides, other evidence may cause us to believe the member over \n            the leader. We should certainly report any suspicious incident to \n            our overseer.<br>\n            <br>\n            It will often be necessary to re-asses your impression after talking \n            to the one on the spot. If doubt lingers, you should usually keep \n            it to yourself until the situation is completely clarified. <br>\n            <br>\n            Leaders should be very wary of tendencies found in most people to \n            second guess other workers, and to feel that \"I know best.\" \n            We should be very reluctant to meddle in the decision making process \n            of the leadership of another cell beyond questioning those leaders.</p>\n          <p>2) All leaders should however, submit to questioning \n            of their ministry by other leaders-- even questioning of a close nature. \n            It is by being questioned that we reexamine our own position, and \n            thus benefit from other leaders. <br>\n            <br>\n            A leader who refuses to be questioned, or who takes offense at being \n            questioned is displaying an immature attitude that contradicts team \n            leadership. Such refusal becomes an issue in itself, and must be resolved \n            before a reasonable level of cooperation can be expected. While any \n            leader may react defensively at first, we have no excuse for continuing \n            in such a posture. Ultimately, refusal to be questioned by fellow \n            leaders is grounds for dismissal from leadership.<br>\n            <br>\n            Don't withdraw from a leader who flares up when questioned. This problem \n            won't go away, and must be resolved at any cost. Get help from the \n            office if needed.</p>\n        </blockquote>\n      </li>\n      <li> Commitment to success. Each Home Church leader should \n        commit his/herself to the goal of seeing real success in the work of all \n        of the other leaders. Unless we can honestly affirm that this is our goal, \n        nothing we say is reliable.</li>\n      <li> Communicating Respect. Other leaders should be viewed \n        as colleagues, and treated with all due respect. There should be an assumption \n        of basic competence, and this should be communicated in the demeanor and \n        the words used in a Home Church leaders' meeting. How is respect communicated?</li>\n    </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Elders' Retreat 1998 (Colorado)","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/ldrteambuilding.html"}

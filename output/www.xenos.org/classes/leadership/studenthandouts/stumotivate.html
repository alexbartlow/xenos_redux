What does a motivated person look like?<br>\n    <br>\n    <br>\n  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The answer we give to these questions will absolutely limit \n  and channel our efforts to motivate others. My suggested definition of motivation \n  is:</p>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><b>People are motivated when they are <i>convinced</i> of \n    the <i>correctness</i> and the <i>urgency</i> of Christian goals to the extent \n    that they are <i>eager</i> to act, and keep acting, to reach those goals regardless \n    of what <i>others</i> do or think.</b></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><b>A.

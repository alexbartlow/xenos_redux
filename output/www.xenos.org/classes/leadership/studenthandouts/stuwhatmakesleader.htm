From the day of Pentecost, the apostles acted as \n  <i>de facto</i> leaders. They preached, taught, (Acts 2:42) and ruled on issues \n  that came up for debate (Acts 6:1,2). They were able to ____________ leadership \n  to others(Acts 6:3,4).</p>\n<p>After the period of the Jerusalem church, attention shifts \n  to Paul's missionary journeys. Paul, too, was an apostle, and an obvious leader. \n  He served in Antioch with a group of men who were said to be \"prophets \n  and teachers.\" (Acts 13:1) These may have been the elders in Antioch, though \n  it never says that. It does record that \"they\" [probably the same \n  men] ______________ on Paul and Barnabas and sent them off on the first journey.\" \n  The reason they chose Paul and Barnabas was divine election (see below). \n  On that journey we see them appointing elders in the new churches they \n  planted. (Acts 14:23) The fasting and prayer that preceeded these appointments \n  suggests they were seeking God's choice for leaders.</p>\nDuring the second journey, Paul added<b> </b>Timothy to his band, \nlikely leading to Timothy's eventual recognition as an apostle. Although this \nis never actually stated, Timothy acts in the role of an apostle in appointing \nelders in and overseeing elders according to 1 Timothy. (Ch. 3; 5:17ff) The only \ncriteria given for why Paul chose Timothy is that \"The brothers at Lystra \nand Iconium \"spoke well of him\" (Acts 16:2) Paul refers to bestowing<b> \n</b>gifts on Timothy by the laying on of his own hands<b> </b>(most likely the \ngift of apostleship). This is also referred to in 1 Tim. 4:14 where Paul reminds \nhim of his gift, \"which was bestowed upon you through prophetic utterance \nwith the laying on of hands by the presbytery.\" Thus, if a prophetic utterance \nwas the occasion of Timothy's choosing, we again have a case of <b>_______________.</b> \n<p>Both Timothy and Titus are given the job of appointing elders. \n  Of interest is the fact that Paul has left them behind to do this work, implying \n  that it was _______________ to select elders when he was there. This suggests \n  that they wanted to see these men<b> </b>actually<b> </b>living out<b> </b>leadership \n  roles<b> </b>before making the choice to recognize them as elders. Likewise, \n  Paul cautions Timothy about deacons: \"They must first be tested; and then \n  if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons.\" (1 Tim. 3:10)</p>\n<p>Overarching these observations about leadership in the early \n  church, we see other evidence of divine election in the selection of leaders. \n  This should be clear for the following reasons.</p>\n<blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n    <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n      <tr> \n        <td valign=\"top\" width=\"34\" height=\"207\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/bullet3.gif\" width=\"12\" hspace=\"11\"></td>\n        <td valign=\"top\" width=\"939\" height=\"207\">1. \n          The Apostles were chosen by Christ. </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr> \n        <td valign=\"top\" width=\"34\" height=\"249\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/bullet3.gif\" width=\"12\" hspace=\"11\"></td>\n        <td valign=\"top\" width=\"939\" height=\"249\">2. \n          Paul comments on his own credentials for \n          leadership in the book of 2 Corinthians 3:1-3: </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr> \n        <td valign=\"top\" width=\"34\" height=\"92\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/bullet3.gif\" width=\"12\" hspace=\"11\"></td>\n        <td valign=\"top\" width=\"939\" height=\"92\"> \n          <p>Notice Paul's reference in 2&#xA0;Cor. 10:12 to \"the \n            field God<b> </b>has<b> __________ </b>to us.\"</p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr> \n        <td valign=\"top\" width=\"34\" height=\"215\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/bullet3.gif\" width=\"12\" hspace=\"11\"></td>\n        <td valign=\"top\" width=\"939\" height=\"215\"> \n          <p>According to Rom.. 12:8, there is a gift of leadership<b>. \n            </b>Likewise, Eph. 4:11,12  </p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr> \n        <td valign=\"top\" width=\"34\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/bullet3.gif\" width=\"12\" hspace=\"11\"></td>\n        <td width=\"939\">We see in the waiting period between the \n          planting of churches and the selection of elders:<br>\n          <br>\n          <br>\n          <br>\n          <br>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr> \n        <td valign=\"top\" width=\"34\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/bullet3.gif\" width=\"12\" hspace=\"11\"></td>\n        <td width=\"939\"> \n          <p>Election was evident with <b>Old Testament Leaders </b> \n            as well. <br>\n            <br>\n            <br>\n            <br>\n            <br>\n          </p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr> \n        <td valign=\"top\" width=\"34\" height=\"140\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/bullet3.gif\" width=\"12\" hspace=\"11\"></td>\n        <td valign=\"top\" width=\"939\" height=\"140\"> \n          <p>Mature Christian character is a prerequisite for \n            leadership in all cases. </p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We conclude that<b> \n  God, not humans </b> \n  makes a person a spiritual leader:</p>\n\n<p>The implications of this perspective \n  on leadership are profound.

We are often reduced to guesswork<b> </b> when \n  naming leaders, because there are<b> </b>so many<b> </b>variables<b>.</b> We \n  usually are faced with compromise in at least some areas with every leader we \n  recognize.</p>\n<p>Even churches that work toward installing only leaders<b> </b>chosen \n  and manifested<b> </b>by God will sometimes find they have leaders who don't<b> \n  </b>belong<b>.</b> These are usually painful situations that call for grace \n  and firmness. Certainly every church would hope to keep such situations to a<b> \n  </b>minimum<b>.</b> Ideally, we should have all our leaders <b>actually functioning </b> \n  as leaders, all belonging in their roles because God himself has chosen to put \n  them there. Realistically, this will<b> </b>not be the case, because even some \n  who were chosen to be leaders at one time, later act in such a way to discredit \n  themselves, or for other reasons are no longer able to serve (e.g. Paul and \n  Barnabas sent away from Antioch). Therefore, this issue becomes<b> </b>a perpetual \n  area of<b> </b>tension in the church as new leaders are considered, and older \n  leaders are reconsidered. Our best move is to follow principles calculated to \n  maximize the likelihood of chosen leaders holding authority so we have a God-made, \n  not a man-made leadership in the church.</p>\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"What Makes Someone a Leader?","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/studenthandouts/stuwhatmakesleader.htm"}

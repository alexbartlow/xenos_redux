The <b>elders or other overseers should be approached\n                first</b> with a proposal, or with a request for help. The home church\n                leaders must demonstrate 1) real need or opportunity, 2) that the\n                people they propose to send include good workers and members, and\n                3) that only a reasonable number of marginally involved people are\n              being sent to join the new group.</p>\n            <p>b. Your sphere leader will undertake a search for a\n                suitable home church before that home church's leaders are approached.\n                This is to prevent friction between home churches as well as wasted\n                time. It is not our policy to have home churches canvassing the fellowship\n                for \"three for two\" arrangements, as this would waste much\n                time, and cause unnecessary stress on the part of home church leaders.\n                Besides, one home church is rarely in a position to assess what is\n              happening in another, still less the overall needs of the fellowship. </p>\n            <p>c. If the supervisory staff find a possible home church\n                partner, the initiating home church leaders or sphere leader should\n                approach the other home church leaders only in confidential discussion.\n                They should carefully avoid the appearance of applying pressure to\n                the other leaders by agitating the members of the other home church.\n              If the proposed partner church is interested, negotiations can begin.</p>\n            <p>d. The elders or supervisory staff should be informed\n                of the outcome of the negotiations. When everyone agrees, the workers\n                and members of the home churches should be approached. All who join\n                the planting attempt must agree freely to go. Leaders should avoid\n                compelling or pressuring people to go on the planting attempt. We may\n              plead and persuade, but not pressure.</p>\n            <p>e. Before the plant, make sure the people from both\n                sides who will be in the new group meet with each other socially and\n                in other ways, so the first meeting of the new church is not the first\n              time they meet each other. Try to build community before going out.</p>\n          </blockquote>\n        </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Planting Home Groups","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/studenthandouts/stuplanting.htm"}

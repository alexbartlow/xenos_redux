To avoid further confusion and to bring glory to God, we have\nconsulted the elders and come together in a combined leaders' meeting to compose our\nthoughts on this key subject. The elders have reviewed the paper, and have affirmed these\nfindings as accurately reflecting Xenos policy. This paper can be freely disseminated as\nmembers see fit. </p>\n\n<h3>What is Leadership Authority?</h3>\n\n<p>Although the heart of leadership according to Scripture is \n  servanthood (Mark 10:42-45), the Bible also teaches that legitimate leaders \n  have authority, in the sense of a right to direct others. This authority comes \n  from God and is delegated to leaders for the good of the church. The following \n  verses reflect the clear teaching that leaders should be respected and obeyed \n  when operating within their legitimate sphere of authority:  \n</p><dl>\n  <dt>1 Cor. 16:15-18 </dt>\n  <dd>You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in\n    Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints. I urge you,\n    brothers, to submit to such as these and to everyone who joins in the work, and labors at\n    it. . . Such men deserve recognition. </dd>\n  <dd>&#xA0;</dd>\n  <dt>1 Thes. 5:12,13 </dt>\n  <dd>Now we ask you, brothers, to respect those who work hard among you, who\n    are over you in the Lord and who admonish you. Hold them in the highest regard in love\n    because of their work. Live in peace with each other.</dd>\n  <dt>&#xA0; </dt>\n  <dd>&#xA0;</dd>\n  <dt>Titus 2:15 </dt>\n  <dd>[Speaking to a leader] These, then, are the things you should \n    teach. Encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone despise \n    you. </dd>\n  <dd>&#xA0;</dd>\n  <dt>Heb. 13:7 </dt>\n  <dd>Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the\n    outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith. </dd>\n  <dd>&#xA0;</dd>\n  <dt>Heb. 13:17 </dt>\n  <dd>Obey your leaders and submit to their authority. They keep \n    watch over you as those who must give an account. Obey them so that their \n    work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no advantage to you. \n    </dd>\n</dl>\n\n<p>The church must allow</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dissent vs. rebellion</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to these points, we would remind people of key \n  qualifications from another of the earlier elders' papers on <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/authority.html\">authority \n  in the church</a>:</p>\n\n<h3><b>1. Leadership Accountability</b></h3>\n\n<blockquote> \n  <p>Delegated authority </p>\n  \n  \n  <p>Leaders are accountable</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> \n  \n  <p>Members have recourse<br>\n    </p>\n  \n  \n</blockquote>\n<p><b>2. Leadership Limitations</b></p>\n<blockquote> \n  <p><i>The scope of the authority is limited to </i><i><b> </b><strong>the\n          area of the authority given to them by God.</strong></i><strong> <br>\nGod\n          does not require us to obey delegated authorities outside the legitimate\n          sphere of their authority.\n    This is why wives are urged to \"be submissive to your <i>own</i> husbands\" -\n    not to all men </strong>(1 Pet. 3:1; Eph. 5:22)<strong>. For the same reason,\n    it is inappropriate for parents to tell their adult children whom they must\n    marry, or for civil\n    authorities to tell their citizens what religious beliefs they must hold,\n  or for church authorities to tell Christians what jobs they may take.\"</strong> </p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Paul uses the family metaphor in a qualified way:</p>\n    <blockquote> \n      <p>We notice two exceptions: 1)Paul compares himself to \n        a mother nursing and a father to the Thessalonians (1 Thess. 2:7, 11). \n        However, the similarity with mothers is the affection they have for their \n        children, and the similarity to fathers was in the way they were \"exhorting \n        and encouraging and imploring\" the Thessalonians. These actions suggest \n        pleas, not commands. 2) He calls himself the Corinthians' father (1 Cor. \n        4:15) and implies that this gives him a measure of authority, but this \n        applies only to those who were actually converted through his ministry.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p>Examples of inappropriate leadership relationships:</p>\n  <blockquote>\n    \n    \n    \n    <p>Members may be accountable to each other<br>\n      <br>\n      <br>\n      <br>\n      <br>\n      Key Consideration:<br>\n      <br>\n      <br>\n      <br>\n      <br>\n      </p>\n    <p>Adverse consequences:</p>\n    \n    \n    <p>A good test for the leader: Am I responsible in this area?</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  \n  <h3>Sample Legitimate Uses of Home Church Leaders' Authority</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <ol>\n      <li>Deciding how a home church will use or not use music \n        in its meetings. </li>\n      <li>Deciding on membership of cell groups or other study \n        groups focusing on discipleship. (But not regulating who attends public \n        meetings like home churches. Note that campus ministry home churches are \n        technically \"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/minteam.htm\">Ministry Teams</a>\" \n        in Xenos, which means they do have the right to restrict attendance at \n        their meetings.) </li>\n      <li>Deciding who is admitted to ministry houses. (However, \n        terms for admission and removal from houses must be disclosed to prospective \n        members <i>before</i> they move in) </li>\n      <li>Deciding who will teach at meetings, and what will be \n        taught. </li>\n      <li>Deciding what ministries will be prioritized at meetings, \n        but not preventing people from practicing ministries they feel led to \n        practice. </li>\n      <li>Deciding when and how to apply formal church discipline. \n        (The elders insist on an opportunity to review and possibly veto any proposed \n        formal discipline involving removal from the church) </li>\n      <li>Deciding what standards will apply in judgment areas \n        of ministry, such as how strict or lenient to be on gray matters, or how \n        certain problems should be counseled. For instance, how soon after a serious \n      moral failure should a personal be allowed to teach? </li>\n      <li>Mapping out a doctrinal position on areas open to question, \n        such as the role of women in the church or social or divorce ethics (but \n        not forbidding members to hold different views in these non-essential \n        areas). </li>\n      <li>Recognizing or removing ministry house leaders, cell leaders, high school leaders (but get sphere leader approval for Sr. leader changes), or sit-in leaders. <br>\n  </li>\n    </ol>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Xenos, the elders have reserved certain decisions:</p>\n\n<blockquote> \n  \n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Sample Areas Where Church Authority Often Becomes Illegitimate</h3>\n<blockquote> \n  <h4>Bible studies or other public ministries started by members \n    outside the established schedule. </h4>\n  <blockquote> \n    \n    \n  </blockquote>\n  <h4>Dating and romance.</h4>\n  <blockquote> \n    \n    <p>Some issues must be addressed by leaders:<br>\n      1&#xA0;Cor.5:11<br>\n      2&#xA0;Cor.&#xA0;6:14 </p>\n    <p><br>\n    <br>\n    Leaders must qualify advice...</p>\n    \n    <p>Avoid these areas:</p>\n    <blockquote> \n      \n    </blockquote>\n    \n  </blockquote>\n  <h4>Discipleship </h4>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>Shepherding Movement: (1980's)<br>\n      <br>\n      </p>\n    <p>Our view of discipleship</p>\n    \n    <p>We need to show respect for the Holy Spirit's ordering \n    of discipleship ministry and personal friendships.</p>\n    \n    <p>Hobbies, Sports, and Time Management </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote> \n    \n    <p><br>\n      <br>\n      Two exceptions to this principle. <br>\n      1) <br>\n      <br>\n      </p>\n    \n  </blockquote>\n  <h4>Choosing Friends. </h4>\n  <blockquote> \n    \n  </blockquote>\n  <h4>Personal Spending. </h4>\n  <blockquote> \n    \n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Xenos College ministry is an exciting, outreaching, growing \n  group of students and leaders. We thank God that we have such a motivated and \n  energized group. We are not calling in this paper for a shift that would make \n  us a soft group. We want full involvement. We want zeal. \n  We want commitment. These are the least we should offer the Lord. By making \n  sure we all have a proper understanding of church leadership and authority, \n  we believe we will sustain our zeal and commitment without stain of wrong-doing \n  or over-doing. While we may see some take advantage of the grace of God, in \n  the long run we will see deeper and more lasting results if we all accept only \n  that authority we should have in our position, and refuse any more.</p>\n<p>In Mark 10, Jesus warns about \"the spirit of the Gentiles\" \n  who love to lord it over one another. John also rebuked \"Diotrephes, who \n  loves to be first among them.\" (3 John) We are thankful we have the kind \n  of leadership that will take positive measures to prevent these problems in \n  our church. Our leaders are our most important assets and we are glad we have \n  good ones.</p>\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Leadership and Authority in the Church:","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/studenthandouts/stuleadershipandauth.html"}

Leadership in a home\n      church is seen as something that must not significantly interfere with\n      typical bourgeois American middle-class living. American culture already\n      places heavy time demands on the modern family that may interfere with\n      an adequate family life. Most American families are convinced they have\n      to: \n      <ul>\n        <li>work long hours;</li>\n        <li> be available\n            for any travel demands their careers may dictate;</li>\n        <li> belong to sports\n            leagues;</li>\n        <li> keep their\n            houses and yards immaculate;</li>\n        <li> clean and care\n            for their late-model cars;</li>\n        <li> shop for the\n            latest styles;</li>\n        <li>maintain their\n            hobbies;</li>\n        <li> keep up with\n            several weekly TV serials;</li>\n        <li>take their kids\n            to every sports league and activity available at school;</li>\n      </ul>\n    <p> If we add attendance\n          at one or two church meetings per week, who has time to do any more?<br>\n            <br>\n      When we compare American living to the early church, we see a striking\n      contrast. In the early church they were \"day by day\" having meals\n      together and meeting from house to house. (Acts 2:46) This expression suggests\n      Christian community took up a very large part of people's lives. Deep community\n      like that described in the New Testament requires significant time investment\n      into relationships. We can't drive up to the McDonald's window and demand\n      community be handed through the window! How can the \"one another\" passages\n      in the New Testament be viewed as realistic apart from heavy time investment?\n      Likewise, the training needed to become competent as Christian leaders\n      takes a great deal of time investment. Becoming a man or woman of God ready\n      to lead a flock for him will certainly interfere in a massive way with\n      materialistic and entertainment pursuits that so dominate the schedules\n      of adult Americans today. Like the rich young ruler, many American church\n      members must turn away in sadness at the New Testament picture of radical\n      Christian living.<br>\n            <br>\n      The result of the divergence between the radical commitment of the New\n      Testament church and today's convenient approach, where only our leftover\n      minutes are devoted to spiritual growth and community is superficiality.\n      Church leaders try to patch together some form of community outwardly like\n      that in the New Testament, but without the devotion and investment assumed\n      in the New Testament. They feel they don't dare call on their people for\n      their time (or, they realize whether they call on them for time doesn't\n      matter, because they aren't going to get it anyway). But simply introducing\n      a structure involving home groups to a church is not going to produce New\n      Testament-style fellowship, let alone a church-planting movement. Although\n      such groups may superficially resemble New Testament house churches, the\n      heart of the matter is missing&#x97;men and women of God sold out to each\n      other and the non-Christian world in the love of Christ!<br>\n            <br>\n      Superficial groups may substitute artificial exercises for real relational\n      closeness. Members may be called on to share something embarrassing, or\n      huddle in prayer while revealing a key need in their lives. People who\n      aren't really close at all, try to act like they are close. Likewise, superficial\n      groups may substitute a scripted approach to ministry for real ministry.\n      Leaders are told what to say and do during a meeting and during personal\n      encounters because they don't understand the Bible or other people well\n      enough to respond to situations creatively and spontaneously. People who\n      are seeing each other in a personal setting for the only time that week,\n      or even the only time in two weeks cannot be expected to know each other's\n      needs or how to meet those needs. The demands of personal discipleship\n      virtually always are too high for today's superficial approaches to home\n      group ministry (unless personal discipleship is also redefined in superficial\n      terms). But without effective, deep discipleship we see little prospect\n      of multiplication, either of disciples or of home churches.\n      </p>\n  </li>\n  <li><b>Impatience</b> -\n        We believe the American church is enamored with spiritual shortcuts.\n        For instance, we want shortcuts to spiritual health and deliverance from\n        sin through a variety of pathways involving miracles or esoteric insights.\n        Plodding, steady spiritual growth seems too unmiraculous for quick-fix\n        Americans. Likewise, when it comes to evangelism and church growth, Americans\n        are fascinated by approaches that provide quick growth. Our media resounds\n        with stories about churches that went from nothing to thousands in a\n        few years or even a few months. And we admit God does work this way in\n        supernatural revival, and he has worked that way at Xenos during certain\n        periods. But is explosive growth in a short time really the norm for\n        Christian ministry? Is this something we should seek or desire? We think\n        building quality and depth in a self-replicating, church-planting movement\n        is more important. Such quality will eventually result in big numbers\n        of people being reached, in fact bigger numbers than revivalism by itself\n        can ever hope to achieve. But leaders and members have to take the long\n        view if they are to successfully pursue a house-church planting strategy.<br>\n             <br>\n    Many impatient churches aren't even willing to pursue home fellowship in\n    any meaningful way, but focus almost exclusively on public shows or musical\n    programs that promise more rapid growth. Such groups are unwilling to invest\n    in any pursuit that takes manpower or resources away from the worship services.\n    We believe most of the growth gained in this way is pseudo-growth. The fancy\n    services are attracting believers away from other believing churches.<br>\n         <br>\n    In the field of home groups, the Yonngi Cho experience in Korea may have\n    caused problems here for the American church. Cho's formula involves doubling\n    and planting small groups every six months. This model is so aggressive it\n    could begin with one six-person small group, and win every adult on earth\n    in 13 years! We think that's a bit impatient, and it should also be clear\n    that something isn't working in the model. We fear the peril of planting\n    such rapidly reproducing groups is unavoidable shallowness in practice. \"Ministry\" becomes\n    oversimplified to mean nothing more than praying God will \"fix\" or\n    heal those with complicated problems. Our reading of the Bible suggests to\n    the contrary, people have to grow out of their problems through a gradual\n    process including struggle, learning, slow growth&#x97;and prayer, too. In\n    extreme cases, members of groups with oversimplified ministry models may\n    even pretend to be changed and keep their hurts or sins secret in the future.<br>\n        <br>\n    Our own ministry has suffered in the past as a result of impatience. Overheating\n    the growth of the church can have catastrophic results as groups are duplicated\n    in numbers, but steadily decline in depth, quality and maturity. Eventually\n    people begin to lose confidence in the whole project because they sense their\n    lives are as messed up as ever and that their relationships are shallow and\n    transitory. An overheated, impatient church planting ministry may eventually\n    become unstable, like a house of cards in danger of complete collapse. In\n    the ensuing chaos, the leadership of the church may turn away from house-church\n    planting completely, the membership may become very demoralized, or a division\n    of the church could result.<br>\n         <br>\n    One thing that always suffers in an impatient atmosphere is personal discipleship.\n    Experience suggests most new Christians need to undergo a process of discipleship\n    lasting some years if their characters are to mature enough to lead successfully\n    in the long haul. Some of this training can go on after a person has already\n    become a leader. But impatient leaders can't stand the long haul implied\n    in a disciple making approach.<br>\n        <br>\n    Learning also suffers in impatient churches. Justified theologically, the\n    ignorance of members is excused and even glorified over against \"bookworms\" and \"ivory-tower\" theologians\n    who are \"do-nothings.\" While we recognize these dangers, we also\n    believe that under this super-spiritual approach, New Testament admonitions\n    to \"study to show yourself a workman approved by God, having no need\n    to be ashamed, and handling accurately the word of truth\" become nonsensical.\n    Neither are we able to \"preach the word,\" as Paul urges Timothy\n    (2 Tim. 2:15; 4:2) unless we do the study. Impatient churches usually shortcut\n    to formulaic teaching that holds no one's interest or highly subjective \"the\n    Lord is telling me\" teaching that cannot offer the answers we need to\n    cope with the falsehood of the world system. The result of an ignorance-based,\n    church-planting approach is a steady reduction of quality in churches planted.\n    Such weak and confused churches tend to collapse over time.<br>\n  </li>\n  <li><b>Inward Focus</b> -\n      We have talked with quite a few churches who started a home group ministry,\n      only to see the groups turn inward and lose evangelistic effectiveness.\n      Such groups are mainly interested in blessing each other and have lost\n      the excitement of evangelism. This pathology is desperate because it is\n      extremely hard to turn around. If anything, we believe that groups who\n      turn inward are in even worse shape than impatient or superficial groups.<br>\n   </li>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Urban House Church Planting at Xenos","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/studenthandouts/stuurbanhousechurchplanting.htm"}

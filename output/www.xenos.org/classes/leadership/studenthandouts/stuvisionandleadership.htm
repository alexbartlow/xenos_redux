Good visionary leading stretches\n              people's credulity just the right amount. They should feel challenged\n              by the immensity of your vision, without feeling hopeless about\n              attaining it. We look for a point where two lines converge: the\n              line between the <b>banal</b> and the amazing (or from commonplace\n              to exceptional) and the line between people's confidence and skepticism.</td>\n          <td width=\"52%\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/buyin.gif\" width=\"281\"></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"48%\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/buyin1.gif\" width=\"281\"></td>\n          <td width=\"52%\">Where these two imaginary lines intersect\n              is the \"<b>buy-in</b>\" zone, where people mentally and\n              emotionally buy into the vision. They must feel that your vision\n              is both <b>bold</b> enough to be worthwhile--even inspiring, and\n              yet probably, or at least possibly doable within the current situation.\n              Some who doubt will hang around to see if it happens. Others must\n              embrace the vision as fully doable and pitch in to accomplish it.</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n      <br>\n      </li>\n    </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"What is vision?","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/studenthandouts/stuvisionandleadership.htm"}

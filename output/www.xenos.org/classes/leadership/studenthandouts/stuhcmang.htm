In other words, \n          when a new home church is planted, they should end up in the same home \n          church. You should not violate this principle without good reason.</p>\n        <p>b) cases where the original outreacher is <b>too young</b> \n          in the Lord to have a teaching ministry, (although in this case he/she \n          should be invited to help disciple the new one in a cell group). Remember, \n          in the early church, people commonly became leaders during their first \n          year in the Lord. Avoid over-qualifying people for ministry! Of course \n          you might be able to do a better job, but ministry is a powerful motivation \n          for growth. Because ministry is a means of growth, it will help immature \n          members to <b>overcome sin problems</b> that may hold them back otherwise. \n          If the bar is too high for getting involved in ministry, the morale \n          in your group will suffer.</p>\n        <p>c) cases where the outreaching one has character flaws \n          so serious that they absolutely disqualify him/her from Christian work. \n          These flaws should be objective, <b>serious</b>, and recent. Again, \n          remember that ministry is a means of growth, and people may need responsibility \n          to help them overcome their bad habits.</p>\n        <p>d) when the outreacher doesn't want to disciple the \n          new person, or fails to do so even after repeated reminders. New people \n          should not have to pay the price for sins of omission committed by our \n          established members. A <b>warning</b> is usually in order before by-passing \n          such an omitter.</p>\n        <p>e) when the new person <b>refuses to accept</b> the \n          leadership of the one who brought him/her, then this principle may also \n          be nullified. However, effort should be made to persuade the new \n          one to follow the outreacher.</p>\n        <p>f) in <b>rare</b> cases where one cell group has been \n          overwhelmed with new people because of a powerful evangelist or a people \n          movement, they may plead for help from other cells. This should be the \n          decision of the <b>overwhelmed group</b>, not a move that is imposed \n          on them. The norm should be that even large numbers won in such situations \n          remain in the same cells together.</p>\n        <p>g) in student groups, <b>incoming students</b> from \n          younger ministries (high school to college, etc.) are often unconnected, \n          but not if workers in the older group were responsible for recruiting \n          the new members (e.g. a college member has been working with the high \n          schooler in a college-led high school group.)</p>\n        <p>h) <b>transfers</b> from other Xenos home churches, \n          recombinations, or <b>referrals</b> from Home Group Connection are typically available \n          to all.</p>\n        <p>NOTE: It is very <b>dangerous</b> and <b>wrong</b> \n          to nullify the principle of allowing the outreacher to work with the \n          new person without just cause. The effect can be loss of motivation \n          in the work force, distrust of leaders, division, and faulty leadership \n          selection.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n    </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Managing Home Church","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/studenthandouts/stuhcmang.htm"}

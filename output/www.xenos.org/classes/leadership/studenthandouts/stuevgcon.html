This is the first priority for leaders.\n</p><p>Although we can use a wide variety of evangelistic methods,\n    our job as leaders is to understand and teach those principles that are most\n    suitable and effective in our home church. The following evangelistic concepts\n    are all evident in scripture. Included under each biblical principle are\n    suggestions for effective implementation.\n</p><p>To agitate for evangelism, lead in evangelism, and empower\n    evangelism, nothing works better than an evangelism-centered <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/studenthandouts/stuprayermeeting.htm\">Worker's\n    Prayer Meeting</a>.

If your Home Church is regularly seeing new people \n          (several per month) who are not \"visitors\", it suggests you \n          probably have active bridges in your group. If this is the case, consider \n          the following measures: <br>\n      <br>\n      <br>  \n      <br>  \n      <br>  \n      <br>\n      <br>\n      <br>\n      <br>  \n      <br>  \n      <br>\n    </p>\n    \n  </ul>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>2.

Leaders \n            in the group need to face the danger, and embark on a campaign of leading \n            change--from whatever has prevailed until now, to a situation with regular \n            effective evangelism.

The central message of Christianity (that salvation \n          is a free gift and that one can have a personal relationship with Christ), \n          has the ability to profoundly affect people on a spiritual level. The \n          Holy Spirit works in cooperation with this message to convict the hearer \n          of its truthfulness and of their need for Christ. This is why Paul said \n          he was careful to stay focused on declaring this message (\"I determined \n          to know nothing among you but Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.\" \n          I Cor. 2:1-5). The effective evangelist trusts the power of this message \n          and knows that it will impact the hearer, regardless of the hearer's \n          initial, visible response. </p>\n        <p>B.

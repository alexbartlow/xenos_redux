These charts graphically clarify whether a group has a problem \n  with lack of outreach, poor follow up, or pastoral problems, as seen in regular \n  loss of their old members. Following are several charts from Xenos home groups. \n  These charts have an added category called Xenos transfers, which could refer \n  either to people who in earlier years attended a Xenos home group, or who have \n  changed from another group because of preference or marriage. What do these \n  charts suggest about the needs of these groups?</p>\n<p>Note: The blue portion (OM) refers to \"original \n  members\" = those who were attending when the home church was planted. The \n  black portion (RN) refers to \"returning new\" people = those who have \n  entered the home church since the last plant and have attended multiple times. \n  The top two portions (aqua and yellow) refer to different kinds of first timers \n  = those who have come for the first time to the home church that month.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/clear3pt.jpg\" alt=\"CLEAR3PT.jpg (122243 bytes)\" width=\"621\"></p>\n<p>The chart above is what a chart should look like ideally.

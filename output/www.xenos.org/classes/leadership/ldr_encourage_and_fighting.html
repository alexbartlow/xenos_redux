This is because the man (or woman) on the spot is the one who is usually best able\n          to judge what is happening.<br>\n          <br>\n          The value of other leaders in this situation is mainly that of <u>questioning</u> the\n          situation, rather than <u>defining</u> it. In other words, by a questioning process, the\n          other leaders should bring out any doubts that they have about the ministry of the one on\n          the spot. However, if the answers given are sensible and correspond with objective fact,\n          they should be believed. Also, if a leader contradicts an account given by a member, we\n          should be disposed to believe the leader over the member, according to I Timothy 5:19.<br>\n          <br>\n          It will often be necessary to re-asses your impression after talking to the one on the\n          spot. If doubt lingers, you should usually keep it to yourself until the situation is\n          completely clarified. <br>\n          <br>\n          Leaders should be very wary of tendencies found in most people to second guess other\n          workers, and to feel that \"I know best.\" We should be very reluctant to meddle\n          in the decision making process of the leadership of another cell <u>beyond questioning\n          those leaders</u>.</li>\n        <li>All leaders should however, submit to questioning of their ministry by other leaders--\n          even questioning of a close nature. It is by being questioned that we re-examine our own\n          position, and thus benefit from other leaders. <br>\n          <br>\n          A leader who refuses to be questioned, or who takes offense at being questioned is\n          displaying an immature attitude that contradicts team leadership. Such refusal becomes an\n          issue in itself, and must be resolved before a reasonable level of cooperation can be\n          expected. While any leader may react defensively at first, we have no excuse for\n          continuing in such a posture.<br>\n          <br>\n          Don't withdraw from a leader who flares up when questioned. This problem won't go away,\n          and must be resolved at any cost. Get help from the office if needed.</li>\n      </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Elders' Retreat 1998 (Colorado)","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/ldr_encourage_and_fighting.html"}

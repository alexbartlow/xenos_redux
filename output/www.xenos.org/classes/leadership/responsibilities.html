David says, \"The \n      Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.\" (Ps. 23:1) Leaders are responsible \n      to see that those in their charge are able to access provision for their \n      spiritual and personal well-being and development. Note this does not mean \n      leaders must provide all nourishment themselves, though they will naturally \n      provide much of it. Followers are responsible to go and take available provision \n      for themselves provided leaders have shown them where and how to take advantage \n      of a given resource. Here analogies like that used by Paul in 1 Thes. 2, \n      (of a mother nursing her baby) break down. Paul was primarily pointing to \n      his feeling of love for the Thessalonians, not how dependent they should \n      be. Part of equipping young Christians is teaching them how to go feed themselves.</p>\n    <p><b>For discussion:</b></p>\n    <p>What are the main areas of provision for which Christian \n      leaders should prepare?</p>\n    <p>What are the main background competencies needed by leaders \n      in order to deliver in this area?</p>\n    <li><b>Protection</b></li>\n    <p>Biblical leadership includes protection from danger. David \n      says \"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall \n      fear no evil, for you are with me.\" (Ps. 23:4) Shepherds are useful \n      for protecting their flocks from wolves. While we are never called to eliminate \n      all dangers from the church, a well-led church is a generally secure place \n      to grow, compared to the world. Leaders should strive to see that the church \n      or ministry is relatively free of wild doctrinal aberrations, dangerous, \n      menacing people, or disruptions that make body life impossible. Leaders \n      must weigh how much freedom to leave and how much control to exercise. After \n      all, young Christians need exposure to a wide range of viewpoints as well \n      as problematic people and situations. This is real life! But if dangers \n      within or from outside the church begin to threaten their well-being, leaders \n      should act to protect. People sometimes even need to be protected from the \n      damage they may do to themselves. Protection could involve practicing church \n      discipline, personal counseling, or other kinds of oversight.</p>\n    <p><b>For discussion:</b></p>\n    <p>Name some typical dangers from which leaders may seek to \n      protect their groups.</p>\n    <p>Name some specific situations that would suggest limitations \n      to the idea of protection.</p>\n    <p>What are the background competencies needed by protecting \n      leaders?</p>\n    <li><b>Direction</b></li>\n    <p>Biblical leadership includes direction. David says, \"He \n      makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside quiet waters... \n      He guides me in the paths of righteousness.\" (Ps. 23:2,3) The world \n      assumes people will automatically know the best direction based on following \n      their feelings. God rejects this idea, and instead advances the idea of \n      leadership and authority. In his view, we often need outside direction on \n      which way to go. Aside from what believers can learn directly from God's \n      word, or what they hear from his inner promptings, believers may at times \n      need the wisdom of fellow Christians. While any Christian may be used to \n      give direction to another, godly leaders are particularly responsible for \n      the direction of the church, and are often called on to give direction to \n      members. Certainly, a group or ministry needs leaders to suggest, or even \n      at times to insist, on a particular direction in the operation of that ministry. \n      Again, directing does not suggest that followers cannot or should not develop \n      their own ability to apply truth to their lives in a wise way. Therefore, \n      the godly leader will at times withhold her counsel and call on members \n      to decide for themselves. Only when people go wrong some of the time will \n      they develop the wisdom to avoid wrong in the future. Therefore, no leader \n      should seek to direct every aspect of a given ministry, let alone the lives \n      of those involved.</p>\n    <p><b>For Discussion:</b></p>\n    <p>Give some examples of issues where strong direction may \n      be needed from leaders.</p>\n    <p>Name some situations where a leader might want to refrain \n      from directing.</p>\n    <p>What background competencies would enable a leader to be \n      a good director?</p>\n    <li><b>Motivation</b></li>\n  </ol>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Areas of Leadership Responsibility","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/responsibilities.html"}

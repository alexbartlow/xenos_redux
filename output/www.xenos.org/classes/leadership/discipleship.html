Numerous members may contribute to the process at this level. Body life is a major contributor to the discipleship task. </p> <p>Below we have described what we see as the nine main areas of learning and growth every disciple needs in order to be complete and mature. For each area of learning, we have described specific skills, attitudes, and competencies the disciple needs to acquire in the course of the discipling process. Under each major heading are several resources you can use to get started. The Perils and Rewards sections are for your use in motivating disciples. By pointing these things out, you may create more interest in pushing forward. The communication ideas are specific ideas for ways you can teach that particular area. We also have a simple version of this outline arranged with headings only in a <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/DiscipleshipGoals.htm\">one-page worksheet</a>.</p> <h2>Table of Contents</h2> <h2>1. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/discipleship.html#a1\">Law and Grace</a></h2> <h2>2. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/discipleship.html#a2\">Sanctification</a></h2> <h2>3. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/discipleship.html#a3\">Bibliology, Hermeneutics and Bible Study Methods</a></h2> <h2>4. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/discipleship.html#a4\">Theology Proper </a></h2> <h2>5. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/discipleship.html#a5\">Satanology</a></h2> <h2>6. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/discipleship.html#a6\">Apologetics and Witnessing</a></h2> <h2>7. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/discipleship.html#a7\">Ecclesiology and Ministry Theory</a></h2> <h2>8. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/discipleship.html#a8\">Relationships, dating, marriage, family life etc.</a></h2> <h2>9. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/discipleship.html#a9\">Pneumatology and Christology</a> </h2> </blockquote> <h2>1. <a name=\"a1\"></a>Law and Grace - the basic principles involved in drawing on the power of God for daily living. </h2> <blockquote> <h4>Materials: </h4> <p>McCallum, <i>Walking in Victory</i>; Nee, <i>The Normal Christian Life</i>; <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu3_prayer.htm\" target=\"_top\">Principles</a> papers; Swindoll's <i>Grace Awakening</i>; &#xA0; <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/law_grc.htm\" target=\"_top\">Web Article on Law and Grace</a>; <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/realmedia/wiv.htm\" target=\"_top\">Real Media</a> </p> </blockquote> <h3>Knows how to confess sin and claim grace </h3> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Scripture: II&#xA0;Cor. 7:10; Ps.32; 51; Jn. 9:40,41; James 5:16; Prov. 28:13; Heb. Heb. 4:15,16; 9:14; 10:19-22; Tit. 3:3-5; </p> <h4>Perils and Rewards: </h4> <p>Those who don't know how to do this end up enslaved to sin due to double life<br> - hypocrisy and self righteousness; guilt and depression; superficiality and loss of intimacy with God and others; rationalization, blame-shifting, etc.<br> - Among the rewards are actual experience of grace and freedom<br> - Healing and experience of God's changing power, </p> <h4>Communication:- </h4> <p>--Model both confession and appropriating grace<br> - Probe into suspected areas of sin problems, communicating grace whenever sins are confessed and pray with them, thanking God for His grace; help them see the effects hidden sins have been having when they do emerge </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h3>Able to set goals under grace, and able to shake off failure and carry on </h3> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Scripture:1 Cor 9:26; Phil 3:13,14 </p> <h4>Perils and Rewards:</h4> <p>- Those who avoid goals because they are afraid they will fail or because they think goals are carnal suffer reduced effectiveness from lack of focus<br> - Repeated failure may produce fatalism and loss of joy.<br> - Non-goal setters may become unstrategic and reactionary in their thinking<br> - Rewards include a more perseverant character and wisdom about what works and what doesn't<br> - Ability to fail for God without losing composure<br> - Increased spiritual toughness </p> <h4>Communication: </h4> <p>--Communicate our own goals, accomplishments and failures<br> - Talk about what we learned from our failures<br> - Help them set realistic and appropriate goals<br> - Counsel them through failures, helping them learn and appreciate grace. See <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/failure.htm\">Theology of Failure</a></p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h3>Knows, articulates, and depends on <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/godmin.html\">God's part in ministry</a> </h3> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Scripture: 1 Cor 3:6,7; 2 Cor 3:5; Col 1:29; Jn 6:44; Mark 4:26-29 </p> <h4>Perils and Rewards</h4> <p>- Man-centered ministers tend to be hyper-controlling since they try to do the impossible--that which only God can do. They are prone to burnout due to failure.<br> - The work of man-centered ministers does not have a lasting influence in the person's life because it is the product of human manipulation rather than divine transformation.<br> Rewards <br> - Allowing God to do His part brings rewards, which would include the joy of seeing God at work. Depending on Him will also increase fellowship with Him through the shared interaction and collective effort.<br> - By allowing God to do His part, ministers will develop greater patience in their own life, have far greater impact in the life of their disciples, and have greater fruitfulness in the church. </p> <h4>Communication:</h4> <p>- The key is to show them how to pray before ministry events and let them see that you depend on God and expect Him to work in people's lives.<br> - As God accomplishes His purpose within the life of the individual, the minister needs to give credit where credit is due by modeling humility, joy and contentment with the role they played.<br> - Point out specific cases where God is obviously at work in the individual.<br> - Leaders should point out to their disciples their tendency to control others instead of expecting God's conviction and leading.<br> - Go through the paper <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/godmin.html\" target=\"_self\">God's Part in Ministry</a> and discuss the questions specific to their tendencies.<br> - Have your disciples study the section on ministry under law in <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/wiv.htm\" target=\"_top\"><i>Walking In Victory</i> </a>as a way to introduce these principles. </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h3>Has developed reasonable ethical priorities, in the sense that he/she knows what constitutes serious sin, versus minor sin. The disciple is focused on the main issues in sanctification rather than \"straining out the gnat and swallowing the camel.\"</h3> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Scripture: Luke 11:42; Mat 22:36-40; 1 Tim 1:6,7; 2 Tim 2:4; </p> <h4>Perils and Rewards:</h4> <p>- Those who fail to focus on serious sin, versus \"fundy\" sin (external sin) issues, may suffer an unfulfilling life because they don't attain progress in crucial areas like loving others and being honest. Instead they may devote most of their attention to things like having a clean language.<br> - They often live double lives, as they seem spiritual on the outside, yet they are practicing secret sin, which entangles them.<br> - They tend to be rigid in their relationships with others, which stifles their ability to grow in intimacy with people. They also tend to be lonely because people do not want to be judged in such minor areas.<br> - By focusing on areas God considers important the rewards include the joy of seeing their lives aligned with God's will. <br> - The disciple will also see freedom from petty rules, leading to enhanced cultural relevance and no misdirection of effort in reaching others for the kingdom of God. </p> <h4>Communication: </h4> <p>- Teach scripture and emphasize God's priorities<br> - They can use vicarious learning through negative examples. Point out how nomistic fundamentalism fails.<br> - Teach them to refuse to submit to petty rules in their own life when confronted by others.<br> - Counsel them through marriage and relational problems that result from their focus on the externals. This will help them see the issues to prioritize.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h3>Understands the true role of the law</h3> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Scripture:Rom 5:20; Rom 7; Gal 2:15-5:26; Heb 8-10;1 Tim 1:6-8 </p> <h4>Perils and Rewards: </h4> <p>- An incorrect view of the law will develop guilt, defeat, and fatalism, doubting of ones salvation, self-righteousness, and hypocrisy<br> - The disciple will be unable to develop and cultivate genuine love relationships. <br> - When you teach and exhibit a correct view of the law the disciple will both experience and live in freedom, having a greater appreciation of grace, honesty, and God's moral standards<b> </b>in their own life and in their relationships with each other </p> <h4>Communication: </h4> <p>- Teach this area allowing the Spirit to convict in areas of importance<br> - Modeling in context of your relationship is also important as you apply the roll of the law; allowing it to show how fallen you are and point toward the need for the grace of God </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h3>Able to detect and correct forms of legalism in themselves and others</h3> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Scripture: Gal. 2:1-10; 3:3;4:9-12; Col 2:16-23;<b> </b>Mt 23:2,3; 23:25 </p> <h4>Perils and Rewards: </h4> <p>- Just as an incorrect view of the law will develop guilt, defeat, and fatalism, doubting of ones salvation, self-righteousness, and hypocrisy, you will also be unable to make sound judgment and decisions. <br> - The inability to love maturely will also destroy fellowship and the witness of the body toward non-Christians. <br> - A proper view allows the discipler and disciple to receive correction without fear of rejection, and be able to honestly discipline themselves as the Spirit of God directs. </p> <h4>Communication: </h4> <p>-<b> </b>Teach and encourage them to set aside some of their arbitrary rules<br> - Directly confront legalistic hypocrisy, especially when it threatens the church<br> - Personally invite criticism for any legalism in your own life.<br> - Model gratitude for correction from others in your own life. This opens the door for you to initiate Godly correction into others' lives. </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h3>Consistently grateful to God </h3> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Scripture: Col 3:15-17; Phil 4:6; 1 Tim 1:12; 1 Thess 1:2; Heb 13:15; Rom 1:21: 1 Pet 2:9 </p> <h4>Perils and Rewards: </h4> <p>--Lack of gratefulness breeds negativity and a failure to recognize what God is doing in your life and your disciple's life. If you lack emotional investment, it will lead to relationships that are characterized as being \"cold fish.\" The ability to witness to non-Christians is truncated, and witness of the group becomes cold and dead as well. <br> - Cultivating thankfulness brings assurance that you are pleasing to God. It will also develop emotional health, peace, and understanding about God's goodness; increasing intimacy with God. </p> <h4>Communication: </h4> <p>The discipler needs to<b> </b>model appreciation for the work of God and His grace. This can be done through praying with spoken and (sometimes) felt gratitude, pointing out blessings in their lives and thanking God for their relationship. </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h2>2. <a name=\"a2\"></a>Sanctification - understanding how to live in our identity in Christ and how to overcome key barriers to growth in the areas of our negative habits. A key sticking point here is learning how to initiate and develop relationships based on mature Christian love.</h2> <blockquote> <blockquote> <h4>Materials: </h4> <p><a target=\"_top\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu2w3.htm\">Principles Unit 2, Unit 3</a>, McCallum, <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/wiv.htm\" target=\"_top\">Walking in Victory</a>, Stanford <i>- Green Letters</i>, Nee - <i>Sit, Walk, Stand</i>; Schaeffer, <i>True Spirituality</i>; <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/realmedia/wiv.htm\" target=\"_top\">Real Media</a> </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h3>Knows about identity in Christ and the correct relationship of indicatives and imperatives </h3> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Scripture: 2 Cor 5:17; Eph 1:1-2:10; Rom 5:1-12; Col 3:1-3; Col 2:10-15 </p> <h4>Perils and Rewards: </h4> <p>- Christians who don't know how to claim their identity in Christ suffer instability and are subject to accusation, desires for man-pleasing, and praise-seeking from others.<br> - They tend to suffer periods of alienation from God and superficial character changes.<br> - A Christ-centered identity produce fruits of consistency, gratitude, appreciation of grace and authentic character change with lasting impact on others. </p> <h4>Communication: </h4> <blockquote> <p>- Focus your teaching efforts on things like \"Know, Consider, Present\" from Rom 6 and the relationship between \"Fact, Faith, and Feeling,\" to help them draw near to God during times of failure and feelings of distance from Him. Also, have the disciple memorize positional truth passages (see <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu2w2.htm\" target=\"_top\">Christian Principles Unit 2 Week 2</a>) and review the scriptural truth basis for important steps of faith. <br> Other reading resources include Stanford's <i>Green Letters</i>, or Nee's <i>Normal Christian Life. </i>The minister might also consider doing a cell group study series on <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/wiv.htm\"><i>Walking in Victory</i>.</a> </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h3>Knows how to worship God in all ways, and with excitement </h3> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Scripture: Col 3:15-17; Eph 5:18,19; Ps. 100; Acts 2:42-47; Rom 12:1,2; Heb 13:15; Rom 15:16 </p> <h4>Perils and Rewards: </h4> <p>- A misunderstanding of worship leads to excessive emotionalism, formalism and/or ritualism. On the other hand, failure to worship with emotion leads to cold, unresponsive, ineffective ministry.<br> - When we realize all of our ministry is worship and we do this with passion and emotion it leads to enjoyment of the opportunities to please God and fulfillment in our lives<br> - When we express emotion to God the result is freedom from inappropriate inhibition. </p> <h4>Communication: </h4> <p>- Do a word study on worship (see conclusions in <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/um2-2.htm\" target=\"_top\">Understanding Ministry</a>). Additionally, model worship in the areas of<b> </b>singing, spontaneous worship of God in prayer in the cell group and one-on-one meetings. You can also take your cell to Rhema Fellowship on Sunday morning and discuss it afterward in the areas of appropriateness, glorifying God collectively, and personal emoting to God. Teaching and modeling verbal affirmations of another's prayer after meetings and one-on-one time affirms their efforts to communicate with God and builds stronger emotional ties between minister and disciple. </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h3>Understands the process of sanctification verses quick fixes </h3> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Scripture: Phil 1:6; 2:12,13; 3:12; 1 Thess 5:23,24, Jn 15:1-10 </p> <h4>Perils and Rewards: </h4> <p>- Those who desire quick fixes tend to bail out before sanctification occurs. <br> - They will suffer frustration and fatalism because their expectations for fast change are disappointed.<br> - The quest for supernatural experiences could lead to extremism, foolishness, or even demonic oppression.<br> - When we accept the process view of sanctification, it leads to consistent pursuit of growth, and appreciation of God's work over time<br> - We are better able to see through false supernatural phenomena </p> <h4>Communication: </h4> <p>Show examples (videos, visit local extremist, experience-oriented churches) of quick fix extremism<br> - Review Gary DeLashmutt's paper <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm\">Crisis vs. Process</a><br> - Share and pray about long term struggles in your own life; <br> - Warn them about dry periods and their in place in sanctification<br> - Point to progress in their lives; study Stanford's <i>Green Letters</i> together. </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h3>Knows and practices the means of growth as a lifestyle </h3> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Scripture: See <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu3syl.htm\" target=\"_top\">Christian Principles Unit 3</a> or <i>Walking in Victory</i>, second half </p> <h4>Perils and Rewards: </h4> <p>- Almost too manifold to mention<br> - Failure to grow versus growth. </p> <h4>Communication: </h4> <p>- Deserves a periodic cell study series<br> - Go through <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/wiv.htm\" target=\"_top\">Walking in Victory</a>, second half together using the <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/wivstud.htm\" target=\"_top\">group study guide</a> </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h3>Able to withstand suffering with an attitude of faith </h3> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Scripture: Luke 9:23; Jn 12:24-26; Phil 1:29; 3:10; John 15:2; Rom 8:35,36; Jas 1:2,3; 2 Cor 1:3-7; Rom 5:3-5; Heb 12:5-13; 1 Pet 1:6,7; </p> <h4>Perils and Rewards: </h4> <p>- Failure to learn this area means progress ends (bailing out) whenever suffering begins<br> - Utterly unreliability<br> - Interprets suffering as punishment. <br> - Will be prone to self-pity, lack of character, and may be unwilling to minister when suffering. <br> - As they understand the role of suffering, they experience maturity, fruitfulness, closer fellowship with Christ, and the hope of eternal rewards. </p> <h4>Communication: </h4> <p>- Warn them that scripture promises suffering for the believer, and have them arm themselves. <br> - Teach them to discern the <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu2w6.htm\">source of suffering</a> (sin, fallen world, suffering for Christ), and discuss areas of hardship in their own lives. <br> - Help them focus on God during periods of suffering<br> - Teach them to avoid being the hireling who runs away in hardship (Jn 10).

If disciples can't answer their opponents, they will lose authority for ministry. <br> - They may gravitate toward experience, tradition or a social gospel to fill the perceived vacuum.<br> - The undermined authority of the scriptures will produce inevitable doubt about God's power in the individual's life as well.<br> - Those who are able to counter the enemy's attacks experience the confidence of a broader and more secure foundation for faith. </p> <h4>Communication: </h4> <p>--Read R.

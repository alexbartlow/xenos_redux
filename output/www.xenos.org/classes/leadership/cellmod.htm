The study guide is available on the web site, and the \r\n        books can be purchased through the site or at the office. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/mansprt.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Man's and the Law's Part in Sanctification</a> \r\n        is a good paper to go over in cell group as is <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/indic.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spiritual \r\n        Growth: The Indicative and Imperative Moods</a>, which comes from <i>Walking \r\n        in Victory</i>. It can lead to good discussion and application. See also \r\n        the books, <i>True Spirituality</i> by Francis Schaeffer, <i>Principles \r\n        of Spiritual Growth</i>, by Miles Stanford, and <i>The Normal Christian \r\n        Life</i>, and <i>Sit Walk Stand</i>, by Watchman Nee.</p>\r\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/mogmin.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Means of Growth: Ministry \r\n        </a>&#150; These each come up in <i>Walking in Victory</i>, but there \r\n        are also good freestanding outlines on the web site. Have your members \r\n        look up the scriptures cited in these papers, and study the context to \r\n        see how they apply. Work to build excitement about the potential for prayer, \r\n        Scripture, Body life, ministry, and growth through adversity.</p>\r\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/mogpray.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Means of Growth: \r\n        Prayer</a>--Teach worship and thanksgiving, intercession, group prayer \r\n        and warring with the devil. A good goal during this section would be for \r\n        some of the members to pray in Home Church. If your group has a prayer \r\n        meeting, try to get your members involved there as well.</p>\r\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/mogsufr.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Means of Growth: \r\n        Suffering</a> - Prepare the people for letdowns. Teach \r\n        them how to interpret their experiences. Disciples have to learn how to \r\n        suffer victoriously if they are to grow and become effective servants \r\n        of God.</p>\r\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/mogbody.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Means of Growth: \r\n        Body Life </a>Fellowship as a Means of Growth. Teach major passages on \r\n        the body of Christ. Explain spiritual gifts, ministries and Christian \r\n        love. Be sure to include </p>\r\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/mogword.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Means of Growth: \r\n        Scripture </a>&#150; This study focuses on the Bible's role in spiritual \r\n        growth. Convincing members that they need to begin their own regular habits \r\n        of Bible reading.</p>\r\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/um2-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Church's Mission</a>. \r\n        Establish evangelism as one of the key purposes of Christianity. Create \r\n        excitement about church growth and salvation. Discussing witnessing will \r\n        motivate people to do it. It is not necessary to get heavy--ordering your \r\n        people to witness. Just give them the tools they will need if they try \r\n        to witness. They will do the rest. </p>\r\n      <p><b>Witnessing Content</b>. Teach the best salvation verses \r\n        and suggest that the members memorize some. Go over how to invite people \r\n        to a meeting. What should you say? Suggest that members prepare their \r\n        own testimony and learn to give it. Teach them how to stress the personal \r\n        as well as the intellectual. Be sure they can clearly and concisely explain \r\n        the cross. You may want to refer to <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/evgcon.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leading Home Group Evangelism</a> \r\n        for material on these issues.</p><p class=\"rdb_br\"><b>Evangelism Communication</b>. Consider using <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/apocom.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apologetics \r\n        and Worldview Critiques: Communication Points </a>or <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu4_evang_2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Objections to Religious Pluralism</a> \r\n        This is a study of how we should come off emotionally and subjectively \r\n        when witnessing. How to show warmth. How to avoid arguments. How adapt \r\n        our communication to the person's progress on the decision continuum. \r\n        How to \"season your words with grace\", etc.</p><p class=\"rdb_br\">\r\n        As you study witnessing, pray weekly for people who you or they have witnessed \r\n        to. As they run into problems, they will be receptive to the next section.</p>\r\n      <p>Apologetics. Give the major areas of common objection \r\n        to Christianity and the basic answers they can give. Place major stress \r\n        on how to communicate those answers. In other words, don't stop with the \r\n        technical answer - go on to how that technical answer can be translated \r\n        into effective street-level communication. Our most important work for \r\n        today's groups is <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/dot.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Death \r\n        of Truth</a>, which has a <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/dotstopt.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">free group study guide</a>. \r\n        I suggest reading chapters 1-5 and 13,14 in cell group, reading around \r\n        the table, and discussing as you go.</p>\r\n      <p><b>Handouts available:<br></b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/pomoch1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Comparing Modernism, Theism and Postmodernism</a><br><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/5wldview.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">A Comparison of Five Worldviews</a><br><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/theistic.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Theistic Apologetics</a><br><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/vpi.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Verbal Plenary Inspiration</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/canonicity-question\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Canonicity Question</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/harmony.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Principles Involved in Harmonizing \r\n        the Synoptic Gospels</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/mosaicp.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ethical Problems in the Pentateuch \r\n        </a><br><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/humnsm.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Secular Humanism</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/sects.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Identifying and Defining Sects</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/islam.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Responding to Islam</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/anonymous-servant\" rel=\"nofollow\">Authenticating Jesus Christ: The Anonymous \r\n        Servant Passages </a><br><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/evilpo.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Responding to the Problem of Evil </a></p>\r\n      <p> <b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/hcfoll.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Follow-Up</a></b>. Follow up \r\n        refers to the process of helping new people in home church continue their \r\n        thought process as they consider the claims of Christ and whether to become \r\n        committed to the home church. Practical instruction on how to welcome \r\n        people and initiate friendships helps them in this area.</p>\r\n      <p><b>Discipleship</b>. Have the group read Coleman's <i>Master \r\n        Plan of Evangelism</i> or, better still, Waylon Moore, <i>Multiplying \r\n        Disciples</i> (available from the office and study center). Create a vision \r\n        in them of their own future discipleship ministry if appropriate. In the \r\n        case of those who are not suited to a formal leadership role, suggest \r\n        membership in a discipling team in a future cell group. Try to create \r\n        hunger for the opportunity to be used by God in discipling someone.</p>\r\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu4_satan_2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Satanology</a>. \r\n        The emphasis of this study should be spiritual warfare in their personal \r\n        lives, and in the Body. Binding in prayer, understanding satanic tactics, \r\n        learning to expect attack, etc. are studied in detail. Major passages \r\n        are covered. A central goal in this section is to develop a militant, \r\n        alert attitude in your people (I Pet. 5:8).</p>\r\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/und_min.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ecclesiology</a>. Teach the \r\n        NT concept of the church. The <em><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/und_min.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Understanding \r\n        Ministry</a></em><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/und_min.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>workbook was designed for \r\n        group study. Show how the concepts are applied in our fellowship. Explain \r\n        church polity, structure, finance, and ministry. Show application at each \r\n        point.</p>\r\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/counseling/counsel.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Counseling</a>. \r\n        Simple pastoral counseling is in view here. It is not only an opportunity \r\n        to teach members how to minister to others, but also how to deal with \r\n        their own problems. Consider using the paper, <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/counseling/luvthpy.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Love \r\n        Therapy</a>.</p>\r\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu1w2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Theology Proper</a>. \r\n        Study the attributes of God and discuss how each applies to Christian \r\n        living.</p>\r\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu1w10.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Christology</a>. \r\n        The nature, work, and states of Christ. The members need to know the basic \r\n        issues regarding Christology. Ask them how they would apply the various \r\n        truths to life.</p>\r\n      <p>Bibliology and hermeneutics. Teach inspiration and canonicity \r\n        in shortened form. Remember that there is very little practice given in \r\n        Principles Classes on interpretation. To help your people learn bibliology \r\n        use the following materials.</p>\r\n      <blockquote> \r\n        <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/vpi.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Verbal Plenary Inspiration</a> \r\n          </p>\r\n        <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/canonicity-question\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Canonicity Question</a> \r\n          </p>\r\n        <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/harmony.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Principles Involved \r\n          in Harmonizing the Synoptic Gospels</a> </p>\r\n        <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/herme.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grammatical Historical \r\n          Hermeneutics </a></p>\r\n        <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/hermsys.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hermeneutical Systems</a> \r\n          </p>\r\n        <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/induct.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inductive Bible Study</a> \r\n          </p>\r\n        <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/apprst.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Application Restrictions</a> \r\n          </p>\r\n        <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/probpass.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Problem Passage \r\n          Interpretation Plan</a> </p>\r\n        <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/gap.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Double Reference in Biblical \r\n          Prophecy</a> </p>\r\n        <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/mosaicp.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ethical Problems \r\n          in the Pentateuch </a></p>\r\n      </blockquote>\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Ideas For Leading A Cell Group","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/cellmod.htm"}

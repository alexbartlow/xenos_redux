If they want to grow spiritually, they will profit immensely \n      from being able to rub shoulders with people who have godly character, practice \n      sacrificial love, keep trusting God for new things (later), and have built \n      a lifestyle centered around serving the Lord.</p>\n    <dir> \n      <dir> \n        <p>This is why Peter says to elders, \"&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;proving \n          to be examples of the flock&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;\" (1&#xA0;Pet.&#xA0;5:3). \n          This is why the author of the Hebrews says, \"Remember those who led \n          you, who spoke the word of God to you; and considering the result of \n          their conduct, imitate their faith.\" (Heb. 13:7).</p>\n        <p>Think about those who have made a great impact on your \n          spiritual lives. Most of them were probably not great visionaries, but \n          they inspired you by their example and they showed you practically how \n          to pray, trust God, share your faith, love others, etc.</p>\n      </dir>\n    </dir>\n    <p>BIBLICAL KNOWLEDGE: By definition, to lead other Christians \n      means telling them what God wants. To the best of our ability, we've got \n      to dish it out by teaching the whole counsel of God (Acts&#xA0;20:27), by \n      answering people's questions, by helping people see how it applies to their \n      present situations, etc. We have to cultivate confidence that God's Word \n      has the power to change people long-term in ways that force of personality, \n      pressure, etc. cannot accomplish.</p>\n    <dir> \n      <dir> \n        <p>Again, if you think back to those who have impacted \n          you the most, you will find that such biblical knowledge is a common \n          feature.</p>\n        <p>You have to be a life-long learner of God's truth. \n          This is why Sanders says good leaders are readers. God can develop this \n          in you, even if you had a poor education, poor study habits, etc. but \n          you have to want it, pray for it, and cooperate with him in building \n          it.</p>\n      </dir>\n    </dir>\n  </dir>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Home Group Enhancement Night - 4/1/98","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/canleadershipbelearned.htm"}

In other words, show people why change is needed. \n    This could involve showing people problems with the status quo, as well as \n    benefits in change. <br>\n    2) Pursue change to the appropriate level of tension. Too little tension results \n    in no change. Too much tension leads to people avoiding each other, failure \n    to communicate, rabbit trails, and disengagement. Here are some practical \n    steps:</p>\n  <blockquote> \n    <p>a) Begin with your inner circle, or leadership colleagues.\n        Take the time to see them fully embrace the need for change (not just\n        acquiescing\n      to change you want). They will have to help you struggle with the church\n        for change, and they, too, will have to pay a price for change, so you\n        need\n      them fully onboard. </p>\n    <p>b) Together with your colleagues, collect a list of benefits \n      connected with the change. And a list of dangers if you fail to change. \n      These dangers are very important, as people fear change, and must be shown \n      that failure to change deserves fear as well.</p>\n    <p>c) Next go to your other committed workers. Do this in\n        concert with your fellow leaders. Again, allow time for open debate and\n        slow movement from one paradigm to another. People change their minds\n        slowly,\n      and not without inner conflict, so don't be thin-skinned if people resist\n        your direction. They may even take this opportunity to launch accusations\n        or doubts about your leadership. Such dissent becomes a real test of\n        the\n      stability and strength of your leadership. The leadership team should be\n        prepared to defend one another, and to redirect the topic back to the\n        issue\n      at hand.</p>\n    <p>d) Take on-going dissenters aside for personal counseling \n      on the issue. Try to understand their worries or reservations. Be prepared \n      to negotiate on any points that won't impair the change. In the end, we \n      have to be prepared to go ahead with, or without the support of such dissenters, \n      but we will clearly have fewer problems if we can win them over to at least \n      giving change a chance.</p>\n    <p>e) Develop a written outline of the changes you are proposing \n      and the reasons for it, and make copies for all. This will hopefully cut \n      down on distortions and confusion (assuming the outline is succinct and \n      well-written).</p>\n    <p>f) Finally, in most cases, schedule a time to discuss\n        the change with the whole church if the change is major. Alternatively,\n        if the\n      change is not expected to be very controversial, you may decide to have\n        various leaders take it separately to their own cell groups. Have your\n        facts\n      ready, and announce the change as something the leadership thinks is a\n        good idea, and would like everyone to support. This is in contrast to\n        a democratic\n      approach (\"Do you guys agree we should do this?\" or \"What \n      does everyone think?\"). Only if the change is considered very unimportant \n      to the health of the church should you leave the decision up to the whole \n      group. God has set leaders in the church to lead, and a democratic approach \n      empowers the least mature Christians more than the most mature. If you do \n      elect to approach the issue democratically, you are obligated to honor the \n      vote taken.</p>\n    <p>g) Return to the issue some weeks or months later, and \n      review what the results of the change have been. This is especially important \n      when the results have been good. Use this as an opportunity to remind them \n      how worried we were, but how this worked out really well, and we should \n      remember this in the future.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Factors When Leading Change","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/leadingchange.htm"}

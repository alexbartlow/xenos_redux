However, for new leaders, \n  a simple model can be useful in gaining a general idea of where to head with \n  a home group. The following model gives a general idea of how individuals and \n  home groups at Xenos progress. Note that the years are general guidelines, and \n  that these may change substantially depending on the age and marital status \n  of the group. Also the \"stages\" of discipleship are imaginary and \n  never actually exist exactly as described. The diagram reads from left to right, \n  and then from top to bottom, before starting over. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/dupmodel.gif\" width=\"552\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Return to Introduction to Christian Leadership</a></p>\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/graphics/navldrwhite.jpg","title":"Key Goals for Home Churches","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/dupmod.html"}

How should we fulfill this commission? We need three elements in a\nsuccessful evangelistic ministry: </big>\n\n</p><ol>\n  <li><big>A plan for proclaiming or sharing the gospel with non-Christians, and people\n    willing and able to implement that plan. </big></li>\n  <li><big>A prayer ministry that opens doors for the gospel and renders people receptive in\n    spite of Satanic opposition. </big></li>\n  <li><big>A community into which we can bring those who are interested in the message. In an\n    evangelistic community, non-Christians see the gospel being lived out by Christians, and\n    have the opportunity to have their questions answered by more learned members if they so\n    desire. They also are in position to begin to learn the basics of Christianity once they\n    make the decision to receive Christ. </big></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2><big>A Plan For Evangelism</big></h2>\n\n<p><big>Although there are a wide variety of evangelistic methods available, the people in\na local church must select the evangelistic strategies that are most suitable and\neffective in the context of their community. The following evangelistic concepts represent\nsome of the stratagems preferred at Xenos Fellowship. All are evident in Scripture.\nIncluded under each biblical principle are suggestions for effective implementation. </big></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><big>Friendship evangelism</big></h3>\n\n<p><big>Evangelism occurs most easily within existing relationships, rather than by\ntalking to strangers. Since we usually already have credibility with our friends and\nfamily members, they are more likely to take the gospel seriously. Because of\nidentification with friends, it is easier for the non- Christian to envision him/herself\nbecoming a Christian. Also, the skills involved in effective friendship evangelism are\nmuch more common than those needed for cold-contact evangelism. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Scripture gives examples of this principle. See Jn. 1:41-51, Acts 16:30-34, and 1\nPet. 3:1,2. </big></p>\n\n<p><big><b>Application:</b> Those of us who have non-Christian friends or relatives should\nbe aware of the opportunity that we have to reach these friends and loved ones for Christ.\nPart of our motivation for sharing the gospel with others is the vision of seeing our\nfriends find Christ and grow spiritually. <br>\n</big></p>\n\n<p><big>We should ask for prayer support from Christian friends in reaching these people.\nThen, we should patiently and carefully endeavor to share the grace of God with them. If\nwe are unsure about how to bring the subject up, or what to say, we should ask older\nChristians for help in these areas. Likewise if we encounter resistance or other\ndifficulties, we should not hesitate to ask for ideas from older Christian friends. </big></p>\n\n<p><big><b>Discussion Question:</b> In the case of those of us who do not currently have\nfriends or relatives who might be responsive to the gospel, in what ways can we still be\ndirectly involved in friendship evangelism? </big></p>\n\n<p><big><b>Answers:</b> <br>\n</big>\n\n</p><ul>\n  <li><big>We can continue to maintain and foster a convinced outlook that outreach is right,\n    and that it is important. This consensus is a vital part of the motivating, healthy\n    environment needed to encourage evangelism in others. </big></li>\n  <li><big>We can pray for non-Christians by name (see below). </big></li>\n  <li><big>We can spend time with non-Christians trying to make friends, showing them the love\n    of Christ in various ways. Christians need to be willing to socialize with non-Christians.\n    This is directly implied in Christ's command that we not only \"love them that love\n    us\"(Mt. 5:46,47). </big></li>\n  <li><big>We may be able to help those who have friends investigating Christianity by\n    advising them, encouraging them, or joining them with their friends. </big></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><big>Acquaintance evangelism</big></h3>\n\n<p><big>We can also share the gospel in relationships that are relatively more distant, or\neven non-existent. Neighbors and associates at work or in sports or civic groups all may\nbe interested in spiritual things. The Bible is clear that God will give us opportunities\nto share our faith and will create need in those people with whom we talk. However, it is\nusually more difficult to do this kind of outreach, and it requires more patience. A good\nbeginning point therefore, would be to approach God on this issue. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>It would be a mistake to think that God will honor a passive attitude in this\narea, or that he will bring about evangelism apart from human agency. Some theologians\nbelieve that it is not up to us to worry about evangelism, and that evangelism will\nnaturally occur if we just focus on growing with God. This perspective, which has been\ncalled \"Search Theology\" is not found in Scripture, and it has been discredited\nover and over again in dead churches that have lost their ability to reach the lost. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Instead, we believe that the church should engage in intentional efforts to win\nlost people, and constantly study ways to become more effective in those efforts. </big></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><big>Cold contact evangelism</big></h3>\n\n<p><big>People who are regularly successful sharing the gospel with complete strangers are\nmanifesting the spiritual gift of evangelism. For most people this is not the best\napproach to evangelism. However, for those gifted to do so, cold contact is a viable and\nimportant way to win lost people to Christ. </big></p>\n\n<h4><big>Discussion:</big></h4>\n\n<p><big>Concerning these three settings of evangelism--friendship, acquaintance, and\ncold-- which are you most drawn to and least drawn to using as an approach to doing\nevangelism? Explain why. Which of these approaches was used when you were saved? </big></p>\n\n\n\n<p><big><a href=\"mailto:DeLashmuttG@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Ask Gary a question or\nshare a comment.</a> <br>\n<a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Ask Dennis a question or share a\ncomment.</a> <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to Xenos Home Page</a> <br>\n  <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/homegroups/index.htm\">Return to Home Group Page</a> <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/und_min.htm\">Return to Understanding Ministry Table of Contents</a> <br>\n  <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/um2-4.htm\">Read on to the next section in Understanding Ministry</a> \n  </big></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Evangelism in the Local Church","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/um2-3.htm"}

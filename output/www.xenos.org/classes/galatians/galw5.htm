Love fulfills the law (:14, <i>Illustration</i>)</p>\n    <p>2. Selfishness destroys (:15 <i>Indicative</i>)</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Theology</p>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Define:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"freedom\", the opposite of slavery, independent\n  or unbound. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Meaning:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This brief passage is a transition from the more abstract\n  truths of law and grace to the practical issues of service. Our freedom in Christ can be\n  used for fleshly purposes that result in destruction or in service which fulfills the Law.\n  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Paul changes directions at this point in the letter. He has\n  been defending his position as an apostle and teaching basic truths about the law and\n  grace. Paul now shifts gears in order to apply what he has been teaching up to this point.\n  He is most likely countering the most common claims of his opponents; namely, that\n  abandoning the law will result in moral decay and anarchy. What then is freedom, if it is\n  not freedom to sin? Paul elaborates on this point in this and the following paragraphs. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Parallel:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1 Pet. 2:16, Rom. 8</p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Application</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Freedom provides opportunity for sin. But we&#x92;ve seen\n  that sin is ultimately destructive. Why would anyone choose it? If you really are sincere\n  at fulfilling the law, then love each other. When a lawyer asked Jesus what was the\n  greatest commandment he replied \"Love the Lord your God&#x85;the second is like it,\n  You shall love your neighbor as yourself,\" (Mt. 22:39). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is the golden rule, \"Therefore, however you want\n  people to treat you, so treat them, for this is the Law and the Prophets,\" (Mt.\n  7:12). God's law is geared toward serving. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Vertical component and horizontal component</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>What is freedom about in the Christian life?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When we think of freedom we think of casting off morals,\n  parental controls, governmental oppression. (Braveheart) In the biblical model, freedom is\n  not about throwing off all restraints. It is all about being released from a slavery to\n  sin and death, brought about by the law, <b>in order that</b> we might be released into\n  God's custody. Here is the whole argument of the book thus far: we have been held in\n  bondage, held under the custody of a cruel taskmaster that would eventually beat us to\n  death, and now we have been liberated, we've been redeemed from the slave market and\n  purchased as a son. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What does it mean to act like an heir? Well, it means to\n  serve in the family of God, to serve in God's kingdom. You may say, I want to be free not\n  to serve. I want to be free to do my own thing. But there is no freedom there. That is\n  simply slavery to death masking as freedom. There are only two options: we serve the\n  flesh, which is death through biting and devouring, or we serve God which results in\n  life--and it ends up fulfilling the Law, though indirectly. (Read Stott p. 143 as\n  antithesis. We become sanctified not by attempting to keep the law through the Spirit but\n  by attempting to love through the Spirit.) </p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Galatians 5:16-24</p>\n\n<p>Structure</p>\n\n<p>Claim:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Walk by the Spirit (:16 <i>Imperative</i>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<dir>\n  <b></b><p>Supports:</p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>1. Flesh opposes spirit (:17 <i>Indicative</i>)</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</dir>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Examples of flesh (:19-21 <i>Illustration</i>)</li>\n    </ul>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>2.

Christians have rendered powerless flesh (:24 <i>Indicative</i>)</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Theology</p>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Define: \n\n</p><dir>\n  <p>\"have crucified\" probably means to have rendered\n  the flesh powerless, used figuratively. The question surrounding this word has to do with\n  the tense of the verb. Is this something that occurred at one point in time or something\n  that had a distinct beginning and is ongoing. </p>\n</dir>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>What's the difference? </em></p>\n  <p>Is he saying that when we accepted Christ our flesh nature\n  was rendered powerless? This is a positional truth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Or is he saying that as Christians we need to continue to\n  pursue crucifying the flesh on a daily basis? This then is a conditional truth.\n  (Positional statement is in keeping with the rest of the book, 2:20. Cross severs\n  relationship to law; cross severs relationship to flesh.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Meaning: \n\n</p><dir>\n  <p>Paul takes the idea of our freedom in Christ one step\n  further than he has done to this point in the book. Not only are we freed from the demands\n  of the Law but we are also freed from the tyranny of sin in our flesh. Because we have\n  crucified our flesh in Christ, which took place in Christ's crucifixion or when we\n  accepted Christ, we are no longer controlled by our fleshly impulses. Paul&#x92;s command\n  to walk by the Spirit is only possible because our flesh no longer reigns supreme. Paul\n  commands his audience to live by the Spirit. He supports this imperative by an\n  illustration of the detrimental effects of the flesh in contrast to the life giving\n  effects of the Spirit. He ends this section with the essential indicative truth that\n  enables the Galatians to live by the Spirit, that is, because they are no longer enslaved\n  to their flesh.</p>\n</dir>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Parallel:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rom. 8:2</p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Application:</p>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Them: \n\n</p><dir>\n  <p>Free to serve. Freedom from the law means we no longer must\n  live up to its demands. The law is of self-effort. The law does not empower us to fulfill\n  it. The law sparks our sin nature and produces sin and this is why it leads to death. On\n  the other hand, the Spirit gives us freedom from the law and from our sinful flesh. The\n  Spirit is the only choice for those who want to be godly.</p>\n</dir>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The flesh can function under the law. You want to live\n  under the law, that's no problem for the flesh. The flesh is very malleable. It is able to\n  conform itself to a rigid religious system--the only thing it is not able to do is submit\n  itself to God. The flesh is not able to be led by the Spirit. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Us: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you don&#x92;t want to live with the fruit of your\n  sinful nature, then walk by the Spirit. Conversely, if you want to know whether\n  you&#x92;ve been walking by the Spirit or the flesh, just look at your actions. Do you\n  snap at your children? Do you fight with your spouse? Do you stay up late so that you get\n  some alone time on the internet when your wife or roommates aren&#x92;t watching? Are you\n  contented in life? Is your life characterized by thankfulness before God for what He has\n  given you?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is no law against these qualities and there is no Law\n  that is able to provide us with these qualities -- only the Spirit of God can produce\n  them. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We cannot simply engage in whatever pleases us. In other\n  words, don&#x92;t simply do what comes naturally. The natural or normal way is the way of\n  the flesh. The flesh is what we have through our natural birth. The Spirit is what we have\n  through our spiritual rebirth. This reminds me of George Kastanza on Seinfeld. George is\n  the sin nature always grubbing and behaving selfishly. (The anti-George episode.) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The Spirit liberates us from bondage to the Law, both\n  in the ultimate sense (approval before God) and in the existential sense (demands of our\n  flesh nature). Therefore, don't return to the bondage of the flesh. Let it remain\n  crucified&#x85; \" (Stott, p. 151-152.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Galatians 5:25-6:10</p>\n\n<p>Structure</p>\n\n<p>Claim:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Live and Walk by Spirit (<i>Controlling theme</i> 5:25)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<dir>\n  <b></b><p>Supports:</p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>1. Don&#x92;t boast (5:25 <i>Example</i>)</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>2. Restore the fallen (6:1 <i>Example</i>)</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</dir>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>3.

Living by the Spirit probably refers to the manner in which we\n  were brought into the kingdom of God. The Galatians began their Christian experience by\n  the Spirit (3:3). We live spiritually only because the Spirit of God is within us. Paul is\n  taking as fact that all Christians live by the Spirit; there is no other way we can live.\n  If this then is how we are regenerated, then let&#x92;s continue our spiritual lives in\n  the manner in which we began them, by depending on the Spirit of God. </p>\n</dir>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Verse 25 also functions to bring together the various\n  thoughts that follow. He then goes on to provide examples of what this kind of lifestyle\n  looks like through a series of brief imperatives. Each of these instructions falls under\n  the umbrella of living by the Spirit. This section is really an expansion of the previous\n  section that details more carefully what walking by the Spirit looks like. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Parallel:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Heb. 3:13 (encourage one another day after day); Eph. 4:15\n  (speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspect into Him)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Application:</p>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Them: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Walk by the Spirit. If you're walking by God's spirit,\n  these are some of the things you will be doing: practicing humility, seeking to restore\n  fallen brothers and sisters, coming alongside other Christians in support as the Spirit\n  comes alongside to support us; sharing with those who teach and train you; practicing\n  endurance in the Christian life; and serving other Christians around you. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I think Paul is telling them, that they are not practicing\n  these things. The Galatians have been biting and devouring one another, they have been\n  boastful and envious, they have been gloating over their brothers and sisters who have\n  fallen into sin. And what has been the result--corruption. The smell of death has\n  characterized this young church. Why, because they have been following the Spirit? No,\n  because they have been trying to live out the law and the law is of the flesh. They smell\n  like death because they have been living in death. They have been living in the flesh. If\n  you want to give off the aroma of Christ to those around you, there is only one way-- to\n  walk by the Spirit. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is great application here also for the person who\n  feels futile. They have been serving God. They have been serving the brothers and sisters\n  around them but don't feel like they have gone anywhere. People don't seem to recognize\n  all of the work I'm doing. God does not seem to acknowledge it. I seem to be going\n  nowhere. We are tempted to be critical of others who are progressing who are being\n  recognized. Maybe you envy those around you who have been given greater responsibilities. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Paul cautions us: God is not mocked. He sees and He\n  rewards. You will sow what you reap. If you are faithful to walk according to the Spirit,\n  if you are faithful in serving, you will change. You will manifest the fruits of the\n  spirit eventually. I think there is a lesson there about God's faithfulness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Us: </em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This kind of life entails a certain amount of action. There\n  is certainly room for being led by the Spirit in the passive sense (v 18). But Paul's\n  command is for us to be active in following the Spirit, \"walk by the Spirit.\"\n  Seek out the things of the Spirit. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If we are to walk according to the line the Holy Spirit\n  lays down for us, we must actively seek out God's way. Paul doesn't really tell us how but\n  I think it would be appropriate to turn to some other passages to flesh this out. Rom.\n  8:5-6 tells us to set our minds on the things of the Spirit. Col. 3:1-2 tells us that\n  since we have been raised with Christ we should continue to seek the things above, to set\n  our minds on Christ. We do this by meditating on Christ. We do this by making it a\n  practice to pray at all times in the Spirit, to have a prayerful approach to God as we go\n  about our day. We walk in the Spirit by immersing our minds and our thought life in the\n  Word of God. We do this above all by seeking to serve those around us, by \"doing good\n  to all men.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Do you want to walk according to the Spirit? Look for\n  opportunities to serve. The Spirit of God wants to love and serve those around us. He\n  wants to use us as a tool of God's love in the world. How else will God reconcile the\n  world to himself, how else will He show the world His character if not through the loving\n  example of His people. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Galatians 6:11-16</p>\n\n<p>Structure</p>\n\n<p>Claim:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Internal transformation over External modification (:15\n  <i>controlling idea</i>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><b>Supports</b>:</p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>1.

He does this to make a final and personal appeal to his\n  friends and spiritual children. Some have suggested the letters are large because of a\n  problem with his eyes. He is probably just adding emphasis to his point. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Paul contrasts the self-serving motives of his enemies with\n  his own care and commitment. Paul's scars are part of the proof of his apostleship--his\n  willingness to suffer for Christ. <b>This is in direct contrast to those who attempt to\n  avoid persecution by \"scarring\" or mutilating the body.</b> Their way avoids\n  persecution while making them look good.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Parallel:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Acts 14; 2 Cor. 11:16-33 (written after Galatians)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Application</p>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Them: <b>\n\n<dir>\n  </dir></b></p><p>Preaching the Jesus Christ crucified results in\n  persecution. It results in persecution because the cross of Christ stands directly in the\n  path of our pride. We cannot do it on our own. The Judaizers wanted to soften the message\n  of the cross. \"Sure Christ's work was important, but if you want to get to heaven you\n  have got to earn it. You must keep the law.\" <b>This is so contrary to grace that\n  Paul says it is an illegitimate child of the truth, it is slavery and those who follow\n  this way have been severed from Christ.</b> </p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If we preach Christ crucified we will encounter hostility,\n  rejection and persecution. But don't let that stop you. You should not care what the world\n  thinks because you are dead to the world and world is dead to you, (:14). </p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Us: \n\n</p><dir>\n  <p>One of my favorite quotes is by John Calvin who said,\n  \"Where there is much ostentation in ceremony, sincerity of heart is rare\n  indeed.\" Our natural tendency is to corrupt what is internal and spiritual by turning\n  it into something that is external and quantifiable. God complains against the Israelites,\n  \"this people draw near with their mouth and honor me with their lips, while their\n  hearts are far from me,\" (Is. 29:13). </p>\n</dir>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We cannot conclude that the outward forms are without\n  purpose, but they are certainly not the essence. Let's apply this to something like the\n  Servant Team. There is value in being part of a group of Christians committed to serving,\n  but if we conclude that this is the heart of the matter--that once you are a part of this\n  external group you can stop serving--you've missed the point. The outward form is far less\n  important than the inward conviction. I would rather have someone in my home group who is\n  a leader in their actions than a leader whose heart isn't in it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Recap:</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>God is disturbed by false teaching.

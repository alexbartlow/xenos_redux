Are they the same as\n  the \"party of the circumcision\"? Probably not as James disavows the disturbers\n  in Acts 15:24. They may have simply been warning Peter that his eating with the Gentiles\n  was causing a stumbling block for Jews who were not Christians. Hence the letter from the\n  Council at Jerusalem in Acts 15. </p>\n  <p>The \"Party of Circumcision\"</p>\n  <p>Salvation is through Grace and following the Law. Therefore\n  Gentile believers must be circumcised and follow the Jewish dietary laws. In other words,\n  it is necessary for the Gentiles to become Jews before they become Christians! </p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Structure</p>\n\n<p>Claim: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Justified by faith not Law (2:16 <i>General theme,\n  conclusion indicator</i>--\"nevertheless\".

It is a legal term meaning the opposite of being guilty.\n  It is to be declared innocent or righteous. It is to be imparted the standing of\n  Christ&#x92;s perfect life; to obtain the standards of God or to live up to God&#x92;s\n  character. We have been acquitted by God but more than that, we have been given\n  righteousness or the standard of the perfection of Christ&#x92;s life. (This is why the\n  idea of our current actions somehow implicating Christ becomes important for Paul, v.17.\n  See also v.20.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Meaning: \n\n</p><dir>\n  <p>Although it is hypocritical for our actions to contradict\n  the gospel, it does not implicate Christ--only ourselves. Paul defines what it means to\n  die to the law: to be crucified with Christ. Paul is now made alive to God and lives in\n  relation to God based on Christ's righteousness in him as opposed to his works. Right\n  standing with God can never be through the Law because none measure up. Right standing\n  with God is based on faith in the life of Christ.</p>\n</dir>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Parallel:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Romans 4-6; Acts 9 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Application</b></p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our right standing with God is through faith in Christ and\n  has nothing to do with our behaviors. If I stumble into sin it is not Christ who sins, but\n  it is I who sin. Our Christian life continues to be lived out of faith in Christ and not\n  based on our deeds. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <b></b><p>This book has changed the course of church history and\n  not only in the first century. It was the book of Galatians that caused the Reformation.\n  Martin Luther was sitting in some German monastery doing an inductive study on Galatians\n  when he realized the folly of Roman Catholicism! Catholicism had added good works to the\n  message of grace and removed justification by faith alone from the gospel. Imagine the\n  result if the Gospel had not prevailed in Galatia and in Jerusalem. The church would be\n  re-enslaved to the Law. We would deny Christ's finished work by adding our works.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Luther writes about the \"justification\" in Gal\n  2:16:</p>\n  <p> \"This is the truth of the gospel. It is\n  also the principal article of all Christian doctrine, wherein the knowledge of all\n  godliness consisteth. Most necessary it is, therefore, that we should know this article\n  well, teach it unto others, and beat it into their heads continually.\" (Stott, <i>Galatians</i>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To add anything to this doctrine of justification by faith\n  alone is to deny or nullify Christ's work. I can add nothing to Christ's work. If I were\n  able to add to His work, it would reduce His work. What Christ did is so beyond me that I\n  am able to contribute nothing. (It would be like adding to infinity. Christ supplies\n  infinity and I come along with 17 good works. You can't add to what is already infinite or\n  what is already perfect.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our actions need to be in line with the truth of the\n  gospel. Peter was in hypocrisy, not because of his teaching but his behavior. He denied\n  the truth of the gospel by compelling Gentile Christians to behave like Jews. We cannot\n  add conditions to the gospel whether they are religious or social or racial. The gospel\n  has a radically equalizing effect on Christians. We are all on the same level in\n  Christ--Paul will spell out this point more clearly later. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Galatians 3:1-5 (should it be :1-9?)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What do you notice about each of these sentences?</p>\n  <p>They are all rhetorical questions. </p>\n  <p>But Paul is making a series of points here so in order to\n  see what he's saying let's strip away the question and state the point directly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Structure</p>\n\n<p>Claim: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You are deceived/foolish ( 3:1 <i>General theme, repetition</i>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <b></b><p>Supports: </p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>1.

The law is not only\n  unnecessary to faith it is contrary to it. This passage is difficult to analyze,\n  structurally, because it is simply a list of rhetorical questions,&#xA0; the sum force of\n  which leads to the conclusion that the Galatians have been deceived. The subordination of\n  points that occurs is conceptual instead of grammatical. They are each subordinated\n  because they are examples. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Parallel:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2 Cor. 11:3 \"&#x85;led astray to the simplicity of\n  devotion to Christ.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Application</b></p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This passage is a great example of the occasional nature of\n  epistles; it wasn't written to us. But does this mean it doesn't apply to us?</p>\n  <p>We should walk in the same way that we came to Christ, that\n  is, with empty hands. Our approval before God as Christians continues in the same way that\n  it began. <i>Faith</i>.</p>\n  <p>We need to \"publicly portray\" Christ as crucified\n  to the world around us.

Abe gained righteousness before\n  the circumcision and the Law had been given. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Abraham was considered righteous by his faith and so are\n  we. Paul argues that what makes a person a son of Abraham is a faith that is of the type\n  of Abraham. Paul's church was convinced that they needed to be Israelites, sons of\n  Abraham, so Paul demonstrates what it really means to be a son of Abraham. Paul supports\n  this point by an appeal to the OT; the reason that all nations will be blessed in Abraham\n  is because he is the father of faith. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is in contrast with the law that is not a blessing but\n  a curse and in stark contrast to faith. Christ freed us from this curse in order that we\n  might be blessed with Abraham. According to the Old Testament, Christ died under the curse\n  of God (Deut. 21:23) because He was hung on a tree. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Parallel:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Romans 4, Gen. 12:3, 15:6, Deut. 21:23, 27:26; Hab. 2:4</p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Application</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We are all under a curse. Our attempts to be \"good\n  enough\" won't cut it. (Romans 3:23) We can never do it on our own; we must come\n  before Christ and put our faith \"into\" Christ as Paul and Peter did in order to\n  be right with God. </p>\n  <p>The law is an all or nothing proposition that only brings\n  condemnation. We cannot pick and choose what to live up to. It's a package deal and it is\n  one that we cannot fulfill. We can never live up to the law in the way it was meant to be\n  lived, the ideal. It is a contract that we can never honor. This is what most of the world\n  attempts. </p>\n  <p>Christ honored the impossible contract for us by becoming a\n  curse, literally by undergoing the condemnation of God for us. Christ's payment then\n  enables us to receive the Spirit and become true descendants of Abraham, which means to be\n  God's people. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/galatians/index.htm\">previous page</a></p>\n&#xA0;\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Wk. 2 Inductive Studies in Galatians","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/galatians/galw2.htm"}

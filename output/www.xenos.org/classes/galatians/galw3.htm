Inheritance is based on promise (This paragraph is the\n    stitching that holds together the chapter. This passage looks back to the previous point\n    while vs. 17 looks forward to the next paragraph.)</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Literary/Theological context: </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Main point before and after:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Theology</p>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Define:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"covenant\", denotes a legal will or testament,\n  unalterable by law or custom. Explain the story linking Abraham to Moses. God's promise to\n  Abe: offspring, land. \"430 years later\" (Ex. 12:40 time of slavery in Egypt) </p>\n  <p>\"Seed\" Is Paul misinterpreting the OT? Paul\n  interprets the promise by God to the Jews, to whom the passage refers, as being more than\n  literal. The promise extends beyond simply Abraham&#x92;s physical descendants, but\n  encompasses Jesus, who was the fulfillment of the blessing&#x97;it is this seed who was a\n  blessing to the nations and not simply the Jews living in the promised land. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Meaning:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Paul is arguing from the lesser to the greater, <i>a\n  fortiori</i>. If it is true in human relations that one cannot change a covenant once it\n  has been enacted, how much more is it true with God. Law stands in contrast to promise;\n  while both are types of covenants, a promise is clearly superior. The law cannot nullify\n  the promise made to Abraham and to the Seed. The promise in this case was made to the\n  singular \"seed\" which Paul concludes is Christ. God&#x92;s promise therefore was\n  to Abraham through Christ. Christ then is Abraham&#x92;s heir and so are all who are in\n  Christ and not necessarily those who are physical descendants. We inherit Abe's promise\n  through Christ and it is by God's grace or \"favor\" (vs. 18 \"God has given\n  grace to Abe by a promise\"). </p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Parallel:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Gen. 12:3, 13:15, 15 (example of ratified covenant)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Applications</p>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Original audience:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Abraham's promise supercedes Moses' covenant. Therefore\n  listen to Abe and not Moses. Inheritance into God's people is based on God's grace. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Today:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Abraham's promise supercedes Moses' covenant. Inheritance\n  into God's people is based on God's grace and not good deeds. This is the gospel. God\n  adopted Abe simply by His grace and likewise we are adopted or become heirs simply by\n  God's grace and not by our own merit. </p>\n  <p>The Law is \"set in stone;\" we cannot add to it.\n  We cannot add Christ to the law. Christ has to completely supercede the law or be crushed\n  by the law. The point is, we can't pick and choose what we want. The law comes as a\n  package deal and so do most religions. We cannot simple take some from this faith and some\n  from that. Most religions are not open ended systems that you can modify as you like. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Galatians 3: 19-24</p>\n\n<p>Structure</p>\n\n<p>Claim: Law is a tutor to Christ (<i>Conclusion\nindicator</i> 3:24) Therefore it ranks below the promise.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <b></b><p>Supports:</p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>1. Law added because of sin (19b Interrogative) </p>\n    <p>2. Required a mediator (:20) It&#x92;s second hand. applies\n    to all Jews</p>\n    <p>3. Law cannot give life (:21 Connective \"for\")</p>\n    <p>4. Law condemns all (:22 Connective \"but\")</p>\n    <p>5. Law is merely a custodian (:23 Connective\n    \"but\")</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Literary/Theological context: </p>\n\n<p>Main point before and after:</p>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Theology</p>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Define: \n\n</p><dir>\n  <p>\"Tutor\" or <i>paidagogos</i>, an instructor,\n  trainer, or disciplinarian who is usually a slave charged with overseeing the conduct of\n  youths. Often depicted in ancient art with a rod, 1 Cor. 4:21. </p>\n  <p>\"confined under the law\", keep the enemy out and\n  the citizens in. Acts 9:24 watched the gates for Paul. </p>\n  <p>Paul asks and answers two questions in this section that\n  his audience would want to know. He anticipates their questions or the objections of the\n  Judaizers. \"Why the Law?\" And \"Does the Law contradict the promise?\" </p>\n  <p>What's all this angel talk in 3:19? See Deut. 33:2.</p>\n  <p>What does it mean that the law was added because of\n  \"transgressions\"? Does he mean to <em>show what transgressions are</em> or does\n  he mean to curb them? (Movie version <i>Ten Commandments</i> versus the book of Exodus,\n  idolatry came after the giving of the law. Hence verse 22 \"the Scripture has shut up\n  all men under sin.\")</p>\n</dir>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Meaning: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Paul argues throughout this section for the inferiority of\n  the law: it came about because of sin, it required a mediator, it is life taking instead\n  of life giving in that it condemns all. The <i>coup de grace</i> of this argument is that\n  the law simply served as a custodian, a slave who trains the immature and uneducated in\n  the ways of truth. </p>\n  <p>The promise required no mediator because God is in essence\n  making a promise to Himself. On the other hand, the Law required a mediator because it\n  involved two parties and applies to all Jews. By implication, the law does not apply to\n  Christ or His descendants. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Parallel:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Deut. 33:2; Rom. 3:20 \"where there is no law there is\n  no transgression\", 23, 6:14, 7:7ff.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Application</p>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Original audience:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The law is subservient to faith in Christ, in fact it's\n  intent was to serve Christ and not the other way around. The law is in no way superior to\n  Jesus Christ. It can only point out sin and the only solution to dealing with that sin is\n  in Christ. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Today:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The purpose of the Law is not to provide salvation but to\n  demonstrate our neediness. God intended that we would become broken on the Law. It is a\n  harsh taskmaster, demanding of us everything but unable to give anything. Think of a\n  governess, not Julie Andrews in the <i>Sound of Music</i>, but of Cinderella&#x92;s\n  stepmother. It cannot give life, it can only give death because it shuts us all up under\n  sin. But it was not meant to be permanent. God imprisoned us (or showed us we were in\n  prison) that Christ might set us free. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The principal point&#x85;of the law&#x85;\n  is to make men not better but worse; that is to say, it sheweth unto them their sin, that\n  by the knowledge thereof they may be humbled, terrified, bruised and broken, and by this\n  means may be driven to seek grace, and so to come to that blessed Seed (sc. Christ),\"\n  Martin Luther (quoted from Stott). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Quote from Stott on the need for the law before the gospel\n  (<i>Galatians</i>, p. 93). What do you think of Stott's point? </p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Galatians 3: 25-29</p>\n\n<p>Structure</p>\n\n<p>Claim:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Abe&#x92;s Heirs by promise (:26, 29 repetition)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <b></b><p>Supports: </p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>1.

This is our spiritual inheritance\n  based on promise, not law. One of the implications of this is a radical equality among\n  believers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Parallel:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Eph. 1, Rom. 4:13ff, Heb. 6:17ff, 1 Cor. 12:13</p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Application</p>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Original audience:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>True sonship comes through Abraham through Christ. Your\n  lineage goes back before Moses to Abraham, but only \"in Christ.\" Throw off the\n  taskmaster. You are sons and all are equal. Don&#x92;t remain under a tutor. Faith has\n  come and we are all sons of God and not children who need the harsh instruction of a\n  taskmaster. The law is outdated and no longer applies. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Today:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The law no longer applies. Christ has so superceded the law\n  that it is unnecessary for us today. So much for Christians who hearken back to the law as\n  being the best foundation for our government or who want to say that it's a good guideline\n  for Christian behavior. Paul says we have graduated. He does not tell us to what we've\n  graduated, ethically speaking, but as far as faith goes, it's passe. </p>\n  <p>The inheritance of Jesus Christ has a radically equalizing\n  effect upon all of God's people. When you are in Christ, that is the most important thing\n  imaginable, everything else is meaningless. Superficial distinctions such as gender,\n  nationality and social status are rendered null and void, being \"in Christ\" is\n  everything. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Galatians 4:1-7</p>\n\n<p>Structure</p>\n\n<p>Claim: You are sons &amp; heirs (<i>Conclusion\nindicator</i> 4:7) \n\n</p><dir>\n  <b></b><p>Supports: </p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>1.

It is\n  a term originating in the marketplace.</p>\n  <p>\"Elemental things,\" meaning the alphabetical\n  things, the basics. The question is to what does it refer? Is Paul referring to the law or\n  is he referring to their own pagan backgrounds? Could he be equating the two as far as\n  salvific effect goes? </p>\n  <i>\n</i></dir>\n\n<p>Meaning: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While we were under the law, or the alphabetical (basic)\n  things, we were like children, no better than slaves. We had no freedom and could not do\n  as we wanted. Picture a child who will inherit an estate on the date set by the father.\n  That date Paul describes as the \"fullness of time.\" At that time, God released\n  us from bondage to the law through Christ. (Why is the law bondage? Because Paul says\n  \"where there is no law, there is no violation, Rom. 4:15.\" And the sting of\n  death is sin and the power of sin is the law,\" 1 Cor. 15:56. The law defines sin and\n  sin brings about death.) </p>\n  <p>It is important that Christ be born of a woman so that He\n  would be fully God and fully man. It is important that Christ be born under the law so\n  that he could fulfill the law. As John Stott says, </p>\n  <p>\"So the divinity of Christ, the humanity of\n  christ and the righteousness of Christ unuquely qualified Him to be man's redeemer. If He\n  had not been man, he could not have redeemed men. If He had not been a righteous man, he\n  could not have redeemed unrighteous men. And if He had not been God's Son, He could not\n  have redeemed men for God or made them sons of God.\" (Galatians, p. 106) </p>\n  <p>Because God bought us back in Christ, we have become\n  adopted children and heirs of an inheritance. The proof of our inheritance is in the\n  Spirit of Christ residing in us who cries out to the father. Paul has taken our adoption\n  one step further, we are not just heirs of Abraham. We are heirs of God the Father. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Parallel:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Eph. 1, Rom. 6:16, Col. 2:8,20</p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Application</p>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Original audience: </p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is a metaphor here from Graeco-Roman culture of a\n  wealthy free man who is childless who buys a slave from the market and makes him his son.\n  Thus he both \"redeems\" the slave and \"adopts\" the slave into his\n  family. This is what God has done for us. Paul says because now that we are sons, we no\n  longer need to address our master as \"sir\" or \"lord\". We no longer\n  live in fear of being beaten like a slave. Rather, we have become children of a loving\n  father whom we can address by the term, \"Dad\". </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Paul is saying, how could you be so foolish as to want to\n  be slaves again. Don't you understand what you have got? You have inherited the\n  mother-load, but even more you've inherited the affections of a father.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Today: </p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While we formerly lived in the futility of our own good\n  deeds, we lived in bondage to our conscience that accuses us or congratulates us. Paul\n  says, we have graduated to being sons of God. More than that we are God's heirs, not just\n  Abraham's heirs but heirs of a much greater fortune, the riches of God's own love and\n  grace. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We have a completely new relationship with the creator of\n  the universe. He is our Father. You might also notice the reference in this passage to the\n  entire Trinity: \"God sent forth His Son\" and \"God sent forth His\n  Spirit\" and we cry out to the \"Father.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/galatians/index.htm\">previous page </a>\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n</p>\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Wk. 3 Inductive Studies in Galatians","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/galatians/galw3.htm"}

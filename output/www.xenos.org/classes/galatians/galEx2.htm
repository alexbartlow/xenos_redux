This\n    imperative is followed by a series of indicative statements dealing with the issue of law\n    and grace.

Paul's language is shockingly graphic\n    but is used to a purpose, namely faith and law are not compatible in the Christian life.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Parallel:</em></p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>John 8:32, Gal. 5:13, Rom 7, Jas. 2:10</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Galatians 5:13-15</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Claim:</strong></p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Do not turn freedom into license (<i>Imperative</i> 5:13)</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><strong>Support:</strong></p>\n    <p>1.

The problem is God&#x92;s word is not\n  designed this way. There is no manual; there are only guidelines. This is because\n  interpretation is not a science. There are methods we can follow to help us come to right\n  conclusions but methods will only get us part of the way there. </p>\n  <p>There is an art to interpreting the Bible. It requires skill, finesse, insight, and the\n  power of the Holy Spirit. </p>\n  </dir>(2 Peter 1:20,21) But know this first of\n  all, that no prophecy of Scripture is <i>a matter</i> of one's own interpretation, for no\n  prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke\n  from God.</p>\n  \n\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Approaching a book for study</p>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Preliminary assessment: What kind of book is this? </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Biblical interpretation really begins with a thorough understanding of the Bible as a\n  whole. But we gain that understanding bit by bit. No one starts out interpreting the Bible\n  with a full-blown knowledge of all its parts. While it is true that the Bible builds upon\n  itself and that later revelation often refers to what was written earlier, much of the New\n  Testament was written to those who were not entirely biblically literate. Much of the NT\n  is simplified and explained for us because it is largely written with a Gentile audience\n  in mind. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You have already answered a few questions as you begin to use this worksheet. You have\n  decided that this book is a letter or an epistle. What&#x92;s the difference? An epistle\n  is a type of letter, but whereas a letter is usually written to a specific individual,\n  such as Timothy, an epistle is written to a wider audience, such as the church in Galatia.\n  But the most important thing to understand is that this kind of writing is occasional;\n  there were specific circumstances which brought about its writing. An epistle is written\n  by an individual at a certain time and place, usually in response to some event, question,\n  or occasion that has presented itself. For instance, the epistle to the Galatians is\n  written in response to pressing concerns about harmful influences in the church. If we\n  discern what situation occasioned the writing of the epistle we are studying, we have gone\n  a long way toward understanding the meaning of the book we&#x92;re studying. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n<dir>\n  <p>Because this book is an epistle you have answered another question\n  as to where it is situated within God&#x92;s redemptive plan. It is clearly after the\n  crucifixion and resurrection of Christ and is written to help us understand more fully the\n  meaning of those events and apply them to daily life. </p>\n  \n</dir>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Epistles: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Unique challenges/characteristics</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Terse:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As opposed to narrative</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Occasional:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What's the occasion?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Audience <i>Specific</i>:</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It was not written to us directly. That does not mean that it does\n  not apply to us or that Paul didn&#x92;t have in mind the universal church when he wrote. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\nInductive Study Worksheet: Epistles</b>\n\n<p><b>Overview Summary </b></p>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Summarize situation</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Author, Audience, Third Party </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Themes<br>\nSummary</p>\n<i>\n\n</i><p><strong>General Overview.</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Read through the book completely. (read in class; divide into paragraphs)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Logic of beginning with overview:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The purpose of beginning by reading the entire book is that it gives you an\n  understanding of where the author is heading. Once you know where the author is going, you\n  will have a better understanding of how he builds his argument. Without getting a sense of\n  the whole, we tend to misuse the parts. We cannot really understand the parts of a text in\n  isolation from each other. This is the error of proof-texting or wrenching a passage out\n  of its context and applying it to a situation. (Example: James 2:14,24 \"What use is\n  it, my brethren, if a man says he has faith, but he has not works? Can that faith save\n  him? &#x85;You see that a man is justified by works, and not by faith alone.\"\n  Luther's response. Passage hinges on \"justification.\") If we have not taken the\n  time to understand the context, we will be guilty of this error by default. However, if we\n  have taken the time to attempt to understand the whole, our ability to understand the\n  parts will be greatly enhanced. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In order to understand a specific passage of scripture we need to see the broader\n  context. We call this the <em>inductive-deductive</em> approach to understand scripture.\n  It is really just a reflection of how understanding occurs in general, that is, we tend to\n  see the parts in terms of the whole. And we understand the whole as made up of various\n  parts. When we approach the biblical interpretation in this way it allows us to have a\n  system of checks and balances. The way this works is that we read a passage, say 1 John\n  3:6. \"No one who abides in Him sins; no one who sins has seen Him or knows Him.\"\n  This passage has been used by those who want to prove that Christians no longer sin. When\n  we read this passage we may immediately question our salvation in Christ because our\n  experience does not conform to this passage. We may waste a lot of time attempting to\n  interpret this passage out of its context. It is only when we are able to see the entire\n  scope of John's epistle and attempt to harmonize this passage with the rest of his letter\n  that we gain any clarity on what he is saying. So what has happened is that we have\n  reasoned from the bottom up (what does this passage say) and from the top down (what does\n  the rest of the book say). We put together the whole in terms of the parts and the parts\n  in terms of the whole. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Historical context: Author, audience, and third party. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Read the book, noting every time the author is mentioned, every time the audience or\n  readers are mentioned, and every time anyone else is mentioned&#x97;we call them the third\n  party. This third party is not who the letter is directed towards but they often figure\n  prominently in why the letter was written. We identify parties in the letter in order to\n  understand what historical circumstances motivated the author&#x92;s communication. Behind\n  this method is an assumption about the nature of epistles which we have already mentioned,\n  that is that epistles are occasional documents, they were written to address a specific\n  situation on a specific occasion. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Who is the third party in Galatians?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<dir>\n  <i></i><p>Hint: </p>\n</dir>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ask questions of the epistle as you read. The secret of good interpretation comes by\n  asking questions of the text, such as: What concerned the author as he wrote? What sorts\n  of error had the readers fallen into? Are there any other groups or people being mentioned\n  by the author to whom the letter is not specifically addressed? Why does the author take\n  the tone or approach that he does? What is motivating the author and what does he want to\n  see changed in his audience? </p>\n  <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"521\">\n    <tr>\n      <td width=\"50\"><p><strong>Galatians</strong></p></td>\n      <td width=\"174\"><p><strong>Author</strong></p></td>\n      <td width=\"91\"><p><strong>Audience</strong></p></td>\n      <td width=\"198\"><p><strong>Third Party</strong></p></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td width=\"50\"><strong>1</strong>:1</td>\n      <td width=\"174\">Paul sent from God, not men</td>\n      <td width=\"91\">&#xA0;</td>\n      <td width=\"198\">&#xA0;</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td width=\"50\">&#xA0;

Identify words or\n  ideas that are repeated or emphasized by the author. This will be an important guiding\n  principle for further interpretation. It will serve as a guidepost and key to help you\n  understand passages in the letter that may be obscure. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Notice that we built our controlling theme based on our understanding of the individual\n  passages of the book. And we will use this theme to better understand parts of the book\n  that are more difficult. But we may find as we begin to take a closer look at specific\n  passages that our understanding of a word or concept was incorrect and our new\n  understanding may lead us to have to reformulate what we have identified as the\n  controlling theme of the book. This kind of back-and-forth approach from the parts to the\n  whole and vice versa is healthy and it allows us to have a dynamic understanding of the\n  book that can be challenged by new information. This allows us to have a growing\n  understanding about the meaning of a book and keeps us from being blinded by our\n  preconceived ideas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <i></i><p>Themes:</p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Paul's Authority. Salvation through faith alone. True Christian liberty.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <i></i><p>Why was this letter written?<i></i></p>\n  \n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>The point of this overview is to understand why the letter was written, who wrote it\n    and to whom.

As you go\n  through my paragraph divisions to do your inductive studies, you may disagree with how I\n  have divided up the book. That&#x92;s fine.

The\n  structure of an author&#x92;s writing functions like a body&#x92;s skeleton. It is unseen\n  when you look at the surface. And yet, it provides the framework that in large part\n  determines the shape and size of the body. Of course, it&#x92;s not the only determining\n  factor in the way a person looks. Attached to the skeleton is muscle\n  tissue&#x97;content&#x97;that drives the movement of the structure. Covering both the\n  skeleton and muscular tissue is the skin&#x97;application&#x97;that gives final shape to\n  the body. The skin is what gives final form to the biblical structure and content and it\n  is what we see of a person day-to-day and yet it is only a reflection of the underlying\n  content/musculature and skeletal structure. </p>\n  <i></i><p>The structure of a book or a paragraph is generally\n  unseen by the reader until he or she begins to look carefully at what is being said. The\n  importance in this is that once you begin to recognize the structure, you will better\n  understand how things fit together. How does the author organize what he wants to\n  communicate? The way he organizes his statements will emphasize certain points while\n  subordinating others. This is important for us because we want to emphasize what the\n  writer emphasizes. This usually becomes clear as we see how an author puts together his thoughts. <br>\n  </p>\n  <p><i>A. </i><b>Context:</b><i> literary &amp; theological</i>\n  </p>\n  <p>What are the ideas or themes communicated before and after your\n  paragraph? From where is the author coming and to where is he going? How does this passage\n  fit into the broader context and argument of the book you are studying? </p>\n  <p>Where is the author going with the point that is being made in the passage you are\n  studying? Is there a break in thought between what occurred previously and what occurs\n  afterward? If so, why? Becoming a good interpreter means being able to see the flow or\n  logic of the text. To use the analogy of the structure of a passage as a skeletal\n  framework, this means being able to see how the bones connect within your passage and\n  which bones they connect to before and after your passage. </p>\n  <i></i><p>B. <b>Main Point:</b><i> What is the central claim of this passage?</i> </p>\n  <p>In order to understand a paragraph we need to know what is the central idea or theme of\n  the paragraph. What does the author want his readers to understand or to do? Write out the\n  central claim in your own words. Is there one verse that most succinctly states the main\n  point? We determine this by considering the following clues the author uses to make his\n  point clear.</p>\n  <p>Read 1:6-10</p>\n  <b></b><p>Hints<i>:</i></p>\n  <p>Identify Conclusions: </p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Conclusions are generally <i>indicated by words like: </i>thus, therefore, so, so that,\n    hence, then, consequently. \"Therefore\" or \"for this reason\" often\n    indicates the author&#x92;s main point. Circle these kinds of words which indicate that\n    the author is drawing a conclusion. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <i></i><p>Identify Imperatives: </p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>An imperative is a command. Often, <b>but not always</b>, in the epistles the main\n    point of a passage is found in the imperative statements. The author is instructing his\n    readers to do a certain activity or to think in a specific way. What is the author telling\n    his audience to do? </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <i></i><p>Identify a controlling idea:</p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Sometimes a passage doesn&#x92;t include an imperative or doesn&#x92;t have a\n    conclusion indicator. Ask yourself what is the controlling idea of the passage.

It may not be a full sentence as it is written but it could be. A\n    dependent clause is one that cannot stand alone as a sentence.

What theological basis or principles are\n    given by the author to support his claim? Or what illustrations does he use to support his\n    point? In this section we are mostly asking questions about why. Why does he want them to\n    do what he tells them to do? Why do they need to understand this information? Why is it\n    important to their Christian lives? </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <b></b><p>List out the supporting points.</p>\n  <p>Hints:</p>\n  <i></i><p>Identify indicatives:</p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Indicatives are statements that claim to be true. They are often the basis for an\n    imperative. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <i></i><p>Identify connective words:</p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Connective words link a supporting idea to a main idea. They tell us the reason behind\n    the central claim of a passage. Connective words are words such as: because, for, since,\n    as, for this purpose, so that, in order that(1Pet4:6). Indicate indicatives in your text\n    by placing a box around these kinds of words and underlining the statement they are linked\n    to. These connective words connect to one of two kinds of statements: indicative\n    statements or result clauses. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <i></i><p>Identify result statements:</p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>These statements indicate the kind of results the author wants to see or wants to warn\n    us about. It is not necessarily an indicative but it is the outcome sought or hoped for.\n    In Galatians 3:24, Paul concludes a section on the purpose of the law with,\n    \"Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ. . .\" He finishes\n    this statement with the result that the Law is intended to bring about, namely, \"so\n    that we may be justified by faith.\" Again, in Galatians 5:16-24 Paul tells his\n    audience to \"walk by the Spirit,\" which is his main point. He backs up his claim\n    by showing his readers the results of walking in the spirit as well as showing them the\n    antithesis, which is walking according to the flesh. The desired outcome, or its\n    antithesis, helps answer the question of why we should do what the author is telling us. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <i></i><p>Identify Illustrations/Examples:</p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Sometimes the author gives an illustration or example to support his main point. Paul\n    does this in Galatians by using Abraham as an example of the principle that righteousness\n    is by faith. In 3:6 he tells the Galatians, \"Even so Abraham believed God, and it was\n    reckoned to him as righteousness.\" Paul uses Abraham as an example of the principle\n    he&#x92;s trying tocommunicate. Whenever the author quotes Scriptures, he is citing an\n    illustration or example. (Rhetorical questions.) </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <i>\n</i></ol>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Content/ Theology:<i> Muscle \n\n</i>In this section we are not as concerned with how something is said as we are with <b>what\n  is said</b>. This is what we normally think of as interpretation. Think again of the\n  passage as a body. The structure or the way the body is put together is the skeletal\n  framework. The muscle that hangs on the skeleton is its content. As we&#x92;ve gone\n  through identifying the structure of the passage, we have also done some of the work in\n  examining the content. In identifying connective words and supporting ideas, we are\n  examining the structure. When we ask what or to whom those ideas or words refer and what\n  they mean we are examining the content. </p>\n  <b></b><p>Hints:<i></i></p>\n  <p>Identify important words and phrases.</p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>In this part of our study, we will want to gain clarity on exactly what is being said\n    and what it means. One way that we do this is by clarifying important or unfamiliar words.\n    It is easy to get bogged down in word studies because nearly every word seems interesting.\n    Be selective in the words you choose to study, usually one to three words in any passage\n    is sufficient. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <i></i><p>Unfamiliar words:</p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>If you&#x92;re unfamiliar with a word, maybe you have never seen the word before or\n    maybe you&#x92;ve just never heard a good definition for it, take the time to look it up\n    in a good Bible dictionary. You may be surprised at the rewards you reap by clarifying\n    unfamiliar words. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <i></i><p>Example: If you're studying Galatians chapter three you may wonder what exactly\n    Paul means by the word \"blessed.\" This is a word that Paul draws from the Old\n    Testament text but it is also a word that Jesus uses. With a relatively small amount of\n    work you can discover that when Paul says \"So then those who are of faith are blessed\n    with Abraham, the believer\" he is referring to much more than an emotional state. The\n    word is used of the gift that would come to the Gentiles through Abraham's willingness to\n    be used by God. It is a theologically loaded term that finds its fulfillment in Jesus\n    Christ. Paul is saying that faith produces the righteousness of Abraham.)</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <i></i><p>Strategically important words: </p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>One way to determine if a word is important is if it&#x92;s emphasized or repeated\n    by the author. In studying the book of Romans the word justification appears numerous\n    times and in many different forms. If we are to understand the meaning of the book of\n    Romans, justification would be an important concept to understand. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Another way that we decide the importance of a word is based on the role it plays in\n    the author&#x92;s thought. Does the paragraph or sentence we&#x92;re studying somehow\n    hinge on an understanding of this word? </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>After you&#x92;ve studied the important or unfamiliar words, how does your new-found\n    appreciation for this word contribute to your understanding of the passage. Eventually we\n    will also want to ask how it affects our understanding of the book?</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Example: \"Deserting\" in 1:6 is a word that means to transfer allegiance from\n    one party to another, or literally to change teachers or to desert your fellow soldiers\n    (metatithami). </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p><i>Identify theological/historical contexts </i></p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>As you think about theological or historical contexts, think about the big picture.\n    What other passages talk about these issues? What other passages might be relevant to the\n    passage you're studying? Do other scriptures speak to the same issues to which your\n    passage speaks? </p>\n    <p>Does the author quote from Scripture or refer to an historical event?

If the author gives an imperative without\n    providing a theological reason, it is important to ask what is the theological or cultural\n    basis for the command. We have looked at <b>how</b> he says it and <b>what</b> he says but\n    it also important to ask why he says it.

If there is an imperative in the passage,\n    what is the author calling on his audience to do? The desired effects may be spelled out\n    plainly by the author but it is important to pause and ask how the application relates to\n    the historical situation of the audience. If the author is telling them to do something is\n    it because they weren't doing it at the time? How would their circumstances relate to what\n    they were or were not doing? </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<dir>\n  <i></i><p>What similarities exist between the original audience and myself\n  or my audience?</p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Before we can move to asking how this passage applies to myself or my audience we need\n    to examine the similarities between our situation and that of the original audience. (The\n    analogy of skin is appropriate here because as circumstances and cultures change the\n    application of a biblical principle, it will take on different manifestations. However,\n    what does not change is the underlying structure of the author's argument--skeleton--and\n    theological content--musculature. In fact, this underlying framework will determine the\n    shape that our application takes in a given context. To carry this analogy further, what\n    we want to avoid is introducing a layer of fat that distorts the theological shape and\n    results in a culturally misappropriate application.) </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</dir>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <i></i><p>Is the passage directly applicable to my audience because we are in the same <i>situation\n  as the original audience or is it only applicable in principle?</i></p>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>The reason we ask this question is because epistles are occasional documents, the\n    writers are in the process of applying truths to specific life circumstances. Because our\n    circumstances may differ from the original audience&#x92;s, we cannot necessarily make a\n    one-to-one correlation. Epistles can be considered \"case studies\" which apply\n    biblical principles to specific situations (Ericson, LMS, p 250) in as much as our current\n    situation mirrors that of the original audience, we can apply the passage directly. But\n    when our circumstances differ significantly, we often need to work from the principle\n    being given in order to apply it to our situation. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <i></i><p>Ephesians 5:18: Drunk with wine or the headcovering example</p>\n  \n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Why is it that most women do not wear headcoverings in the church today even though\n    Paul explicitly commands it? The reason has to do with cultural relevance. Paul was giving\n    a practical expression of a spiritual truth, namely that we should&#x97;in this case women\n    should&#x97;respect authority. The principle of authority (1 Cor. 11:3) is tied to a\n    spiritual truth but the way that this respect is shown is in keeping with the cultural\n    norms. In 1 Cor.11:5,14 Paul is telling the church specifically not to go against cultural\n    norms in expressing this principle of submission to authority. However, outward expression\n    of this principle in dress or manner is no longer relevant today because it is not\n    something our culture practices and yet the biblical principle remains true and should\n    find expression in the attitudes and interactions between a husband and a wife.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>What is Paul&#x92;s attitude toward those who add anything to the gospel? Should we\n    treat distorters (Catholics?) in the way Paul is referring to them here? Paul is not\n    addressing them directly. Persuade first. We need to recognize that those who preach false\n    gospels are opposing Christ.

Think of specific situations in which this passage or its principle\n    would apply in your life and be as specific as possible.

Should we use the material in the Old Testament? What about the\ngospels? Our answer to these questions have a number of important implications, as we will\nsoon see. </big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big>Our answer to this question depends on our understanding of <i>when the church\nbegan</i>. </big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big>Protestants have tended to answer this question in two basic ways: Some define the\nchurch as comprising all believers from Adam on. Accordingly, they feel the freedom to\ninclude some of the Old Testament material in their understanding of the church. This is\nalso the position of Roman Catholicism. Others define the church as comprising all\nChristians from <b>Pentecost</b> on. They therefore see the church as a distinct program\nfrom Israel. According to these, the primary biblical materials which define the church\nare Jesus' explicit teaching on the church (e.g., Mt. 16:18; 18:17; 28:18-20), Acts, the\nepistles, and Rev. 1-3. </big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big>Those who believe the church began on the day of Pentecost justify their idea from\nScripture following way: </big>\n</p><ol class=\"style1\">\n  <li><big>The church is Christ's body. (Col. 1:18) </big></li>\n  <li><big>The baptism by the Holy Spirit is the means by which believers in Christ are\n    incorporated into his body. (1 Cor. 12:13) </big></li>\n  <li><big>The baptism by the Holy Spirit began on the day of Pentecost after Christ's\n    resurrection. (Acts 1:5; 2:1-4; 11:15-17) </big></li>\n  <li><big>Therefore, the church began on the day of Pentecost after Christ's resurrection. </big></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"style1\"><big>Confusing the Old Covenant and the church</big></h2>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big>Because some churches feel the freedom to use Old Covenant material in their\nunderstanding of the church, they have an inherent tendency to incorporate Old Covenant\nstructures into church life. Consider the following examples. </big></p>\n\n<h4 class=\"style1\"><big>Tabernacle/Temple</big></h4>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Past Purpose</b>: The tabernacle was a prophetic picture of God's intent to\ndwell in his people; his presence dwelt in the building in a unique way. The symbolic\nevents conducted in the tabernacle explained why God could not indwell his people (because\nof their sins) and how he would one day overcome this problem (by making atonement for\ntheir sins through his chosen substitute). </big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Present Error</b>: Now this prophetic picture has been fulfilled. God dwells in\nevery Christian and in the church corporately; the church is the temple of God. (1 Cor.\n3:16; Eph. 2:20-22; 1 Pet. 2:4,5) Thus, it is no longer proper to regard any building as\nthe place where God dwells in a special way. </big></p>\n\n<h6 class=\"style1\"><big>Discussion:</big></h6>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big>What effects would we expect from this error? </big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Possible Answers</b>: Most people view the church as a building rather than the\npeople indwelt by God. Many people superstitiously believe the church building (or the\nsanctuary therein) is \"God's house\" in that his presence is localized there more\nso than anywhere else. For this reason, people often speak in hushed tones when entering a\nsanctuary, even when no one else is there! Parents tell children not to run or play in the\nsanctuary because \"this is God's house.\" Not only does this suggest God is\nanti-fun; it also communicates that God is still unable to indwell us personally as we\ncome to him through Christ. </big></p>\n\n<h4 class=\"style1\"><big>Priesthood</big></h4>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Past Purpose</b>: The high priest was a type of Christ. (Heb. 3:1; 4:14) For\nthis reason, he alone was permitted to enter into God's presence with a sacrifice for the\npeople's sins. The other priests were a type of Christians in that they could draw near to\nGod and communicate the knowledge of God to the people. The rest of the people were\nessentially passive participants in the service of God. </big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Present Error</b>: This clergy-laity distinction which was valid in the Old\nCovenant period is now invalid. Because of Jesus' sacrifice, all believers have equal\naccess to God and equal privilege to communicate the knowledge of God to others. ((Heb.\n10:19-22; 1 Pet. 2:9) </big></p>\n\n<h6 class=\"style1\"><big>Discussion:</big></h6>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big>What effects would we expect from this error? </big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Possible Answers</b>: The effect of the clergy-laity distinction has usually\nbeen to discourage unordained Christians from ministering in significant ways. Church\nmembers often think it is the minister's job to reach out to others, teach the Bible, give\nspiritual counsel, etc. With no significant ministry purpose to pursue, many church\nmembers by default become enmeshed in materialism, which offers a counterfeit\nsignificance. This is a tragic squandering of the resources of the church. </big></p>\n\n<h4 class=\"style1\"><big>Sabbath and Festival Calendar</big></h4>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Past Purpose</b>: God gave the Israelites a full calendar of \"holy\"\ndays. The Sabbath and the prescribed festivals were largely prophetic pictures of the\nsalvation which Jesus would accomplish. (Col. 2:16,17) </big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Present Error</b>: Now that Christ has paid for our sins, every day is holy in\nthe sense that salvation has occurred once and for all. Paul makes it clear in Rom. 14:1-5\nthat only those Christians who are \"weak in faith\" ascribe intrinsic spiritual\nsignificance to the observance of the Sabbath. In Gal. 4:1-11, he says that Christians who\ngo back to observing the festival calendar are regressing rather than progressing\nspiritually. </big></p>\n\n<h6 class=\"style1\"><big>Discussion:</big></h6>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big>What effects would we expect from this error? </big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Possible Answers</b>: Many people erroneously believe that what matters to God\nis that we go to church on Sundays, or at least on Christmas and Easter. The effect of\nthis formalistic approach to God is to reinforce the impression that an impersonal\nrelationship with God is what he desires. </big></p>\n\n<h4 class=\"style1\"><big>Liturgical Worship Service</big></h4>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Past Purpose</b>: The Old Covenant worship of God was highly ritualistic. This\nwas because it was designed to be an elaborate predictive picture of the work of Christ.\n(Heb. 8:5) The content and order of this ritual observance was highly regulated because it\ntaught that we must come to God in the way he prescribed - by faith in his Substitute. </big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Present Error</b>: Now that these pictures have been fulfilled, they are\nobsolete. (Heb. 8:13) Not only does the New Testament not describe or command a worship\nservice for the church; there is also a positive reinterpretation of this whole concept\n(see section on \"Worship in the New Testament\"). Also, the number of prescribed\nrituals has been drastically reduced (from hundreds to two) and the regulation of how to\nobserve them has been minimized. </big></p>\n\n<h6 class=\"style1\"><big>Discussion:</big></h6>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big>What effects would we expect from this error? </big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Possible Answers</b>: Those who subscribe to the necessity of liturgical\nworship invariably communicate an impersonal relationship with God when the way is now\nopen to have an intensely personal relationship with him. Also, it is all too easy to\ncontinue to observe ritual even when the reality of the relationship is not there. This is\nwhy we have so many ritualistic churches today where the members do not know God\npersonally. This ritualism is a turn-off to those who long for personal contact with God. </big></p>\n\n<h4 class=\"style1\"><big>Infant Circumcision</big></h4>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Past Purpose</b>: Infant circumcision was a ritual given by God to Abraham and\nhis physical descendents. (Gen. 17:9-14) Circumcision was to be the sign that Israel was\nGod's people. It was also a symbol of their need to be liberated from the bondage of their\nsin- natures. (Deut. 10:16; Jer. 4:4) God predicted that when Messiah came, he would\n\"circumcise your heart . . . to love the Lord your God.\" (Deut. 30:6) </big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Present Error</b>: The symbolism of physical circumcision has fulfilled in the\ndeath of Christ through which he disarmed the authority of our sin natures. (Col. 2:11) In\nspite of the fact that all clear examples of baptism in the New Testament are adult\nbelievers, many churches see infant baptism as the church's counterpart to infant\ncircumcision. Roman Catholic doctrine states that it removes the guilt of original sin,\nthus teaching that spiritual regeneration comes through baptism. Many Protestant\ndenominations erroneously believe that passages like Rom. 6:4 and Col. 2:11 refer to water\nbaptism, and thus almost seem to teach baptismal regeneration. </big></p>\n\n<h6 class=\"style1\"><big>Discussion:</big></h6>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big>What effects would we expect from this error? </big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Possible Answers</b>: When asked if they will go to heaven, people commonly\nanswer \"yes\" because they were baptized as infants. Infant baptism has the\neffect of de- emphasizing the necessity of personal conversion to Christ. Instead, it\ncommunicates that salvation is something entered into on the basis of parental decision or\nritual observance. This is a formalistic definition of Christianity which leads to whole\nchurches full of nominal Christians (in name only). </big></p>\n\n<h4 class=\"style1\"><big>Emphasis on the Law</big></h4>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Past Purpose</b>: The Old Testament law code was a national contract with\nIsrael which stipulated the conditions by which they could enjoy the land of Canaan. (see\nDeut. 28) It also had a spiritual value in that it showed them their need for God's grace\nwhich would be given when Messiah came. (Gal. 3:22-25) For both of these reasons, it was\nentirely proper for Israel to have a \"law emphasis.\" </big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Present Error</b>: The church is not a national entity living in Canaan, but an\ninternational community. Furthermore, now that Christ has come, we have access to new\nministries of the Holy Spirit, making it possible for us to serve \"in the newness of\nthe Spirit rather than the oldness of the letter.\" (Rom. 7:6) The emphasis of the\nchurch should therefore be on the good news of God's grace, not on the Law and the threat\nof God's judgment. </big></p>\n\n<h6 class=\"style1\"><big>Discussion:</big></h6>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big>What effects would we expect from this error? </big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Answers</b>: Many denominations emphasize the Ten Commandments more than the\ngrace of God. The effect is that many people grow up with the view that God is primarily a\nGod of judgment rather than a God of love who has provided a way to forever escape his\njudgment. Some respond to this emphasis by running from God altogether; others become\nself-righteous. In either case, the unchurched person does not get the impression that\nChristianity is about the grace of God. </big></p>\n\n<h4 class=\"style1\"><big>Outreach Strategy</big></h4>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Past Purpose</b>: God's strategy for reaching Gentiles in the Old Testament\nperiod was centripetal. As the Israelites stayed in the land and followed the Law, God\ngranted them national security and material prosperity. Foreigners would notice this, and\nsome would thus adopt YHWH as their God. (Deut. 28:7-14; 1 Kings 10:1-12) The main reason\nfor this \"stay in the land\" strategy was that the Holy Spirit was not operative\nin the same way he is today, so the Israelites needed to be a separate culture to prevent\ncomplete apostasy. </big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Present Error</b>: Since the coming of the Holy Spirit, the God's outreach\nstrategy has changed from centripetal (\"stay in the land\") to centrifugal\n(\"go into all the world\" - see Mt. 28:18; Acts 1:8). God's people are no longer\nto be a distinct culture, but rather are commanded identify culturally with those that\nthey seek to reach (1 Cor. 9:19-23). Also, whereas material blessing was at times a\nlegitimate national indication of Israel's obedience to God (although see Deut.\n8:11-14;31:20; Prov. 30:8,9; Neh. 9:25.26; Hos. 13:6), this is not the case in the church\n(see 1 Cor. 4:9-16; Rev. 3:14-19). </big></p>\n\n<h6 class=\"style1\"><big>Discussion:</big></h6>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big>What effects would we expect from this error? </big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Possible Answers</b>: Churches commonly emphasize \"witnessing by your\nlifestyle\" instead of teaching that every Christian is to actively reach out to the\nlost through verbal evangelism as well as through an attractive lifestyle. Many churches\nalso have developed their own sub-culture which effectively isolates them from\nnon-Christians. In addition, many churches affirm the Old Covenant view of wealth and thus\npassively (or even actively) condone materialism. These features are clearly at odds with\nGod's present strategy. </big></p>\n\n<h4 class=\"style1\"><big>Relationship Between Church and State</big></h4>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Past Purpose</b>: In the Old Testament the nation of Israel was both a\nspiritual and national entity. The government of Israel was originally a theocracy,\neventually replaced by a theocratic-chosen king. God needed a nation where he could\npreserve the witness he was accumulating about himself. It was entirely in order for God\nto call on the government of ancient Israel to operate the nation in a just and godly way.\n</big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Present Error</b>: In the New Testament, the church is not expected to function\nas a nation state. On the contrary, the program is clearly different as witnessed by the\ncall to submit to, and obey the Roman government--one of the most godless and brutal\ngovernments in history. (Rom. 13:1) The New Testament is devoid of any call to take over\nsociety or to run society God's way. Unfortunately, many Bible interpreters continue to\nread the Covenantal promises and warnings addressed to Israel in the Old Testament as\nthough they apply either to the church, or to the United States (or other countries). <br>\n</big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big>A very common example of this confusion is the often quoted passage in 2\nChronicles 7:13 \"If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command\nthe locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among My people, and My people who\nare called by My name humble themselves and pray, and seek My face and turn from their\nwicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin, and will heal their\nland.\" It is a mistake to apply this passage to the United States? It refers to the\ncursing/blessing section in the book of Deuteronomy. The people who are called by God's\nname are Israel. There is in fact no such promise extended to other countries. <br>\n</big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big>One qualification is needed on this point. In the ancient world, there was no\nopportunity to vote on government issues or candidates. We do not know what God would have\nsaid if there was. Probably, a good ethical case can be made for Christian activism in\npolitics as long as it falls short of attempts to establish a Christian state. </big></p>\n\n<h6 class=\"style1\"><big>Discussion:</big></h6>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big>What effects would we expect from this error? </big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><b>Possible Answers</b>: History is full of examples of catastrophic results when\nthe church has concluded that it is to run the state. A nation state often has to operate\nin the area of compulsion, punishment and even war. All of these things are inappropriate\nfor the church. The church needs to keep crystal clear loyalties, excluding any\nnon-biblical insertion into Christian doctrine. <br>\n</big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big>Manipulators use values similar or even identical to those in the Bible to get\nChristians to back their agendas. For instance, no two themes are more universal in world\nreligions than the sanctity of the family and the sacredness of the given\ncultural-national heritage. Oriental religion often actually worships parents and\nancestors. Islam views the state as expressly a religious entity. Most oral religions are\none and the same as the government of the tribe. This has tended to be true of\nChristianity as well in Europe. The medieval church was convinced that the state was to\noperate under the spiritual authority of the church. <br>\n</big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big>Linking the universal appeal of blood and soil values with patriotic values and\nreligion leads to the formation of a civil religion which is sometimes only nominally\nChristian. For instance, the implication of a prominent evangelical leading whole football\nstadiums in prayer before games is clear- -all or most of those present must be\nChristians. It is easy to see why people begin to believe that Christianity is synonymous\nwith American citizenship or church membership. <br>\n</big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big>This nominal Christianity is one of the most deadly threats to real Christianity\nfor two reasons. In the first place, it causes people to believe that they are Christians\nwhen they are not, and secondly, it misrepresents Christianity to the secular world.\nInstead of seeing real vibrant spiritual living on the part of the church, society sees a\nChristianity that is plagued by confusion and mediocrity. <br>\n</big></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big>Francis Schaeffer has argued, \"If there are no absolutes by which to judge\nsociety, then society is absolute.\" Francis Schaeffer, How Shall We Then Live? (Old\nTappan NJ: Fleming H Revell Company, 1976), p. 224. What does this statement mean, and do\nyou agree with it? What absolute should judge the state, and what if the majority don't\nagree with that absolute? Should the Bible dictate morality even to non-Christians? </big></p>\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\"><big>Conclusion</big></h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big>From these examples we can see why it matters what biblical material we use in\nconstructing our understanding of the church! If we answer this question wrongly, we are\nfar more likely to go astray in setting the whole tone for what Christianity is like. </big></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><big><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Ask Dennis a question or\nshare a comment.</a> <br>\n<a href=\"mailto:DeLashmuttG@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Ask Gary a question or share a\ncomment.</a> <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/und_min.htm\">Return to Understanding Ministry Table of Contents</a> <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/index.htm\">Return to the Xenos Courses Page</a> <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to Xenos Home Page</a> <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/um1-1a.htm\">Read on to the next section in Understanding Ministry</a>  </big></p>\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Definition of Universal and Local Church","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/classes/um1-1.htm"}

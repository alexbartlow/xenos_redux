Reading assignments will be given each week from the Old\n    Testament. The assignments familiarize students with the variety of biblical literature\n    and the thematic development of the plan of salvation in the Old Testament. For each book\n    (or section of book) read, students write chapter titles, which summarize the major theme\n    of each chapter. Chapter summaries are to be turned in each week. They account for 50% of\n    the final grade.</p>\n    <p>2. A final test will be given on the sixth week. A review\n    sheet will be given on the fourth week.

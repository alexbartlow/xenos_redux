It is a mainstay of Western art, literature and cinema.\nAs children, we were perhaps exposed to the stories of the Old\nTestament in Sunday school. So we connect with David and Goliath, Moses on Mount Sinai,\nand Daniel in the lion's den. But when it comes to questions like, \"what does it all\nmean?\" and \"what possible relevance does the Old Testament have for my\nlife,\" we probably feel in the dark. \n\n<p>And some of us may have tried to remedy the situation by sitting down and reading\nthrough the Old Testament. So we begin with the creation, strain our way through the flood\nstory, then bail out in the genealogies of Genesis 10,11. Solid evidence that the Old\nTestament was not intended to be read by 20th century readers.</p>\n\n<p>But at the same time, we know that the Old Testament was the Bible for the earliest\nChristians and that Jesus is the fulfillment of the Old Testament hope for a messiah. We\nlook at our Bibles and see that 2/3 is Old Testament. Even when we read the New Testament,\nthere are over 600 direct or indirect references to the Old Testament. So here we are.\nStuck with the need to make sense out of the Old Testament.</p>\n\n<p>Objectives/Goals (from the syllabus):</p>\n\n<p>1. To recognize the unifying theme of the Old Testament. There is a thesis to the Old\nTestament: <i>God is at work, reconciling creation to himself</i>. We will see this theme\nevery week. It is really the key to understanding the Old Testament and we will see how\nthe Old Testament narrative is structured around God&#x92;s strategy in human history.</p>\n\n<p>2. To understand the history and literature of the Old Testament. Part of what makes\nthe Old Testament so difficult to understand is the fact that it was written to a very\nancient people. How they thought and how they lived is in many ways far different from us\nin the modern world. So understanding the history and cultural forms of the Ancient Near\nEast will be an important part of getting to the meaning of the Old Testament.</p>\n\n<p>3. To inspire a passion for studying the Old Testament. My greatest hope for this class\nis that we become deeply affected by the extraordinary power of the Old Testament message.\nOnce we understand just a few basic issues of history and interpretation, the meaning of\nthe text is opened up to us. We find, the more deeply we study, that we are face to face\nwith the mind of God himself. This is a profound and life changing experience--and this is\nwhat stimulates a passion for probing the depths of the scripture.</p>\n<b>\n\nHow should we look at the Old Testament?\n<i>\n\n</i></b>Critical View \n\n<ul>\n  \n  <li>What do most people think about the Old Testament?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>The critical view of the Old Testament is common today. On a popular level, we have all\n    probably heard people say, \"Oh the Bible: its just a bunch of mythology\", or\n    \"its just the writing of primitive men\", or \"it's just like all the other\n    religious myths around the world.\" Most people who have not read the Bible or know\n    anything about Biblical scholarship hold this view. The reason why this has become the\n    dominant view is because critics of the Bible in the university usually hold beliefs that\n    they take to their study of the Old Testament. The sentiment I've just described is rooted\n    in an approach to the Bible that was born in Enlightenment thought. Basic thesis: universe\n    is a closed system of cause and effect. If there were a God, he could do nothing to affect\n    the affairs of his creation (Naturalism and Deism). The study of the Bible then, is simply\n    an investigation into how a particular culture speculated about the kinds of things we\n    couldn't know anyway.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Critical method and assumption</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>A \"naturalistic\" approach</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>The critical view holds that unless we can demonstrate by known facts outside of the\n      Bible that an event recorded in the Bible happened, there is no reason to accept it as\n      having occurred. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Historical&#x97;Critical Method: \"Burden of proof\" always on the Bible</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>The \"burden of proof\" is always on the scripture. We will assume that the\n      Bible is legend or myth until proven otherwise.</p>\n      <p>\"On some things just about everyone agrees. The Bible version of Israelite history\n      after the reign of Solomon, for example, is generally believed to be based on historical\n      fact <i>because</i> it is corroborated by independent accounts of Kings and battles in\n      Egyptian and Assyrian inscriptions of the time. Prior to that, though&#x97;before about\n      930 B.C.&#x97;the experts disagree on just about everything. [Critics assert that ]\n      &#x91;If it cannot be proved to be historical [by external evidence], it&#x92;s not\n      historical.&#x92;\" \"Are the Bible&#x92;s Stories True?\", <i>Time</i>,\n      12/18/95.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Responding to the critical view:</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>The assumption of the Enlightenment rationalists is not very compelling. There are many\n      reasons to reject the idea that the universe is a \"closed\" system. </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <ul>\n      <li>A questionable assumption and a flawed method</li>\n    </ul>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p>Why should we begin with the assumption that revelation is impossible?</p>\n        <p>Historians accept a document as reliable unless there is a factual basis to reject it.\n        The burden of proof falls to the detractor.</p>\n        <p>But more importantly, the historical method of the critical scholars has both backfired\n        and is inconsistent with accepted historical method. <i>The research approach of\n        historians is to accept a document that purports to be history as history unless there is\n        a factual basis to deny it's reliability.</i> That is, the burden of proof is with the\n        detractor, not with the historical document. This is true of all documents of antiquity,\n        not just the Bible. Historians do not, for example, consider Thucidides' history of the\n        Pelopponesian Wars as myth or legend because it contain references to the Greek gods; or\n        Tacitus' history of the Caesars because he accepted them as deities. </p>\n        <p>E.g.: English 280 v.

Old Testament is <i>not </i>mythology \n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>The truth of the Bible rests in its historicity. YHWH is the God of history. History is\n    one of his key chosen media to reveal himself to humanity. We read frequent expressions\n    throughout the Old Testament, such as, \"I am the God of Abraham, Isaac and\n    Jacob\", \"I raised you up on eagles' wings and delivered you from the hand of\n    Pharoah\". In the 4th week, we will discuss in detail the message of the prophets. The\n    most crucial way God sought to separate himself from the false religions of the ancient\n    world is through predictive prophecy&#x97;concrete evidence of sovereignty over history\n    (Is. 41:21-23; 42:8,9; 44:6-8).</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>2. Old Testament history is <i>prophetic history \n\n</i>\n  </p><li>Driven by a central theme</li>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>By this, we mean that God impacts human history, and does so with a strategic purpose\n    in mind. There is a message throughout the Bible: God is working to effect a\n    reconciliation between himself and his renegade creation (Rom. 8:21; Col. 1:20). Thus, we\n    refer to biblical history as \"salvation history.\" It is history with the purpose\n    of revealing God to man. It is not man's attempt to understand and speculate about God,\n    but God communicating himself to man.</p>\n    <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/theonar2.gif\" alt=\"theonar2.gif (4999 bytes)\" width=\"400\"></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Theological content is key statement of divine purpose for history</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  \n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Old Testament history is <i>selective</i></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All history is selective. It is impossible to write history and include all of the\n  details that surround certain events.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Narratives are carefully arranged according to theological purpose</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Since Old Testament serves a purpose, events and people recorded in the pages of the\n    Old Testament are selected because they related to that purpose.</p>\n    <p>E.g.: Omri did much to protect and enlarge Israel's borders. But the Old Testament says\n    little more than that he \"carried on in the sin of Jeroboam, son of Nebat.\"</p>\n    <p>E.g.: Much is known of King Solomon's economic accomplishments, but they are eclipsed\n    in the biblical narrative by the failures of his later years, when he permitted the\n    worship of false gods for his many pagan wives.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Summary:</p>\n\n<p>1. The Old Testament is a work of history, not mythology.</p>\n\n<p>2. Old Testament history is prophetic history: God's plan of salvation.</p>\n\n<p>3.

The\n    \"heavens and earth\" speak of the totality and completeness of God's creative\n    act. Heavens and earth form a \"marism\" or statement of opposites that indicate\n    totality. So we end verse one with a complete, perfect work.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>3.

This could refer either to six literal 24 hour days, or to an\n    age, or extended period of time. The latter seems to be a better choice in view of the\n    geological record and the description of the day in which Adam was created.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>We don&#x92;t know the means used</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Doesn&#x92;t include creation of angels or the devil</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Let's note that the creation account makes no mention of the creation of the angels, or\n    the existence of the devil, though he is introduced without explanation in chapter 3.\n    Clearly, the original readers of Genesis already knew of the existence of angels and of\n    the devil. It was not important for them to have this material included. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>4. Pinnacle of creation narrative: Humanity in God&#x92;s image (Gen. 1:26-30)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The last creative act is man. It is man alone who shares the distinctive of being God's\n  image-barer. Read Gen. 1:26-30. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Basis of human dignity and intrinsic value</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>The image of God entails being spiritual and personal, in contrast to the rest of\n    creation. Man is not merely more complex than the rest of creation, his is qualitatively\n    distinct. The view of the Old Testament creation account of man is singularly unique in\n    the world's literature. All other views of man hold that we are the same as nature. The\n    dignity and value of man simply cannot be accounted for apart from the message of the\n    Genesis record.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>God&#x92;s intent for man (Gen. 1:28)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>The uniqueness of man is born out in the charge that God have him: To be his steward\n    over creation (1:26, 28). God created a cosmos. Now man is to maintain it. Man now, not\n    the anointed cherub is God's steward in the Garden. And, as the story of salvation unfolds\n    in the Bible, it will be through man that God finally reestablishes his complete, just and\n    righteous rule on the earth (Romans 8:19-22).</p>\n    <p>Another aspect of the creation of man is also significant in that it offers an\n    important contrast to ANE creation myths. In the Genesis account, man is given creation\n    for his needs (Gen. 1:29, 30). ANE mythology presents the purpose of man on earth to be\n    about the business of serving the infantile pantheon of nature gods who are too\n    self-absorbed to feed themselves (Heidel, p. 120,1).</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Terms of God&#x92;s blessing (Gen. 2:16,17)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Man is free to enjoy and care for God's good creation. He is to populate the earth. The\n    first people were morally innocent (2:25) and experienced open fellowship with God. Man is\n    personal. He is capable of love, and it was God's purpose that Adam use the gift of free\n    will to voluntarily subordinate himself to God's loving rulership over him. But freedom\n    involves real choice, and real responsibility for those choices. Genuine freedom includes\n    the freedom to rebel.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol type=\"i\">\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>i. The possibility of disobedience</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The context of the narrative indicates that\n      the tree was real, not just a symbol. But the emphasis of the passage is more on the\n      prohibition and consequences of disobedience than on the tree itself. The tree provided a\n      concrete opportunity to either remain under God's loving sovereignty, or to chart a\n      separate course. It offered the pursuit of moral knowledge independent of the design of\n      God for man.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>ii. The consequence of disobedience</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>Consequences: Death. The price of disobedience is stated, but not defined. It is not\n      until the next chapter that we come to terms with the consequences of disobedience from\n      God.</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>\n    \n  \n\n<b>\n\n<strong>Fall</strong></b>: <b>history&#x92;s great tragedy</b>\n(Genesis 3:1&#x97;21)\n\n<p>1.

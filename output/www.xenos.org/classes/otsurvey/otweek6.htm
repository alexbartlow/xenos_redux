He was the king who prayed for wisdom. </li>\n  <li>These works focus on general truths, and are not to be understood as without exception.</li>\n  <li>The major unifying theme in both of these books is the notion of the \"fear of the\n    Lord.\" The fear of the Lord is not terror, but awe of the Lord which arises from a\n    proper understanding of his nature. Used143 times with hundreds of other variants, the\n    concept in included in historical narrative, prophets and wisdom literature, including 24\n    times in Psalms and 18 times in Proverbs.</li>\n  <li>The Proverbs and Ecclesiastes both show the importance of the fear of the Lord in the\n    practical affairs of life. </li></ul>\n\n<b>\n\nEcclesiastes \n\n</b>\n  <li>Controlling theme of the \"fear of the Lord\" is mentioned on six occasions\n    (3:14; 5:7; 7:18; 8:12,13). The central thesis of the book is the second to last verse,\n    where Solomon exhorts his son to fear the Lord.</li>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>The application of the fear of the Lord is the plight of the autonomous man, who does\n      not fear God. Autonomous man cannot make sense out of life. Vanity of vanities does not\n      mean that life is a bore or that all things are futile and without meaning. Rather, it\n      means that human existence in and of itself cannot supply the key to life's meaning. Only\n      in proper relationship to God are the varied and paradoxical experiences of life rendered\n      meaningful. Only in proper relationship to God, as represented by one who fears God, can\n      the fractured pieces of human existence be unified into a meaningful whole.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>Read 8:12-14.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>The one who fears the Lord, and who is thus able to make sense out of his life is in\n      striking contrast to the wisdom of the world. Consider Ps. 53, \"the fool has said in\n      his heart, 'there is no God'.\" Or, consider the \"futile speculations\" of\n      those who reject the glory of God (Rom. 1). These are of the same sort as those who reason\n      \"<i>under the sun</i>\" (1:3, 9, 13, 14; 2:11; 3:16,; 4:1, 3; 6:12....).</li></ul></blockquote>\n  \n\n<b>\n\nProverbs \n\n</b>\n  <li>The theme of the fear of the Lord is applied to the quality of life, rather than to its\n    meaning. As the controlling theme of Proverbs, the fear of the Lord is mentioned directly\n    13 times. It is tied to the experience of an abundant life (1:7; 2:5; 8:12-14; 15:33....).</li>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>The thesis of Proverbs is expressed in 1:7. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of\n      wisdom. The wise man is one who prospers while his opposite, the fool, is the one who\n      suffers loss. When a man fears God and becomes wise, he avoids evil, walks in\n      righteousness, loves God and experiences the blessings of life.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Wise and fool contrasted</p>\n\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"7\" width=\"649\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"50%\" valign=\"TOP\">The wise</td>\n    <td width=\"50%\" valign=\"TOP\">The fool</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"50%\" valign=\"TOP\">1:1&#x97;6 Proverbs impart\n    wisdom,<blockquote>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p>understanding, wise behavior</p>\n      </blockquote>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>1:7 \"Fear of the Lord\" is basis</p>\n    <p>1:20 Wisdom personified, \"she\"</p>\n    <p>1:23 Wisdom offers reproof</p>\n    <p>2:1&#x97;4 Wisdom to be pursued</p>\n    <p>2:5&#x97;8 Wisdom is path of justice</p>\n    <p>2:10 Wisdom is pleasant to soul</p>\n    <p>2:11&#x97;22 Wisdom directs our paths</p>\n    <p>3:1&#x97;5 Don&#x92;t forget wisdom</p>\n    <p>3:13 Wisdom is a blessing, more</p>\n    <p>precious than gold</p>\n    <p>4:4&#x97;9 Wisdom to be acquired, not</p>\n    <p>forsaken;

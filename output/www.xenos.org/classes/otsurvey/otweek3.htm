The entire Canaanite population is to be utterly destroyed. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Why the ban? The ban raises significant questions in the mind of most readers. Could the\n    God of grace and mercy really demand such extraordinary measures? It conjures up images of\n    Cambodia under the Khamir Rouge, and solidifies the impression that the God of the Old\n    Testament is a wrathful God, in sharp contrast to the God of the New Testament. Let's take\n    a closer look at the legislation and the Canaanite culture.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Canaanite culture, like all of the cultures of the ANE, centered around its religion. By\n      all standards of comparison, the Canaanite religion was enormously dehumanizing.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/molech.gif\" alt=\"molech.gif (18315 bytes)\" width=\"298\"><br>\n    The Canaanites worshipped Molech (sitting on\n    left).</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>El was the primary god of the Canaanite pantheon. He is a creator god. Creation occurs\n      by sexual procreation with female deities. Thus, worship of El takes on sexual form.\n      Priestesses were essentially sex slaves of the cult.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Ba'al or Hadad. Son of El. He was the head of the Canaanite pantheon. He was younger and\n        more virile than El. He is the god of rain, and therefore, like El, tied to fertility.</li>\n      <li>Annat, wife of Astarti. Very similar to Kali of India. She was the goddess of sex, war\n        and fertility. She is both sensuous and dangerous. She is a sacred prostitute for the\n        gods, terms, \"holy one.\" Shown riding naked on a lion with a flower in one hand\n        and a serpent in the other. She delights in blood. A very violent and fickle goddess.\n        Human heads form a necklace in depictions of her. There was both the practice of ritual\n        prostitution and human sacrifice to Annat and El.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>Read: John Bright, <u>A History of Israel</u>, pp. 118,119</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Revelation of God to the Canaanites. The annihilation of Canaanite cities occurred after\n    many years of rejecting the revelation God gave them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Gen. 15:16. God would not give the land to Abraham, because the \"iniquity of the\n      Amorite was not yet complete.\" That is, they had not, as a culture, gone beyond the\n      point at which they could respond to God.</li>\n    <li>The Canaanites had witnessed the willingness of God to judge those who resisted him\n      personally on several occasions. E.g.: Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 19). Also,\n      Josh. 2:10-14 makes it clear that 40 years prior to it's destruction, Jericho know of\n      God's deliverance from Egypt. </li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Conquest was judgment on the <i>culture</i>. The intent of the ban was that, \"they\n    might not teach detestable things\" (Deut. 20:18). It must be recognized that the\n    failure to complete the conquest set the stage in later generations, under the era of the\n    judges, for a resurgence of Canaanite religion, with its devastating consequences for\n    Israel. (see Judges 2:1-3, 10-15, 19-23).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Judgment on a culture is not the same as god's eternal judgment on all of the\n      individuals within the society. Those who were unable to make moral choices or comprehend\n      what the culture stood for would not be held accountable before God (see 2 Sam. 12:22).</li>\n    <li>While God used the Hebrews as his instrument in judging the Canaanites, it does not\n      follow that the Hebrews are characterized as meriting the land (Deut. 7:7-11). The land\n      was given simply because God is faithful to his promises.</li>\n    <li>God does not delight in the destruction of any person or culture. He executes temporal\n      judgment only when his greater redemptive plan requires it. See, for example Jonah 3:4-10.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Historicity of the conquest. According to biblical chronology, the conquest began in\n    about 1400 BC. According to archaeological excavation of Tell el-Sultan (Jericho), level\n    4, Egyptian pottery from the 15th century BC has been found. Further, of the 150,000\n    pieces of pottery recovered from this level, none dates to later than 1400 BC. There is no\n    evidence of Mycenaean pottery at this level either. This is significant, because other\n    finds have shown that after 1400 BC, there are extensive caches of Mycenaean pottery in\n    the area. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Amarna Tablets. Series of correspondences between petty kings of Canaan seeking military\n      assistance from Egypt. The names of the kings match the narrative of kings and cities in\n      Joshua. We know the tablets to have been written between 1400-1370 BC. The tablets speak\n      of an invading people, called the \"habiru.\" Many scholars link this term to the\n      Israelites (Egypt's Seti I and Ramses II identify the Habiru with the Hebrews in their\n      later conquest of Bethshan c. 1310 BC).</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n<b><i>\n\n</i><strong>The Judges (Judges)</strong><i>\n\n\n</i><em>Israel: 1377-1055 BC</em><i>\n</i></b>\n\n<p>\"Judges\" is the history of this era. The thesis for this 300 year era of\nIsrael's history is summarized in Judges 2:11-22. The main theme can be viewed as a <i>cycle\n</i>described in this passage: </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/apostcyc.gif\" alt=\"apostcyc.gif (3270 bytes)\" width=\"519\"> \n\n</p><ul>\n  <li>v.11-13. Israel serves the Baals. This is referred to as \"playing the harlot.\"\n    The \"people of God's own possession\" rejected their relationship to God, and\n    turned to serve Canaanite gods.</li>\n  <li>v.14,15. God withdraws his protection from Israel in response to their apostasy. He\n    gives them into the hands of \"plunderers who plunder them.\" The land is\n    occupied; the people are scattered and often slaughtered.</li>\n  <li>v.16-18. God raised up judges to rule over Israel. During the rule of the judge, the\n    enemy would be repelled and the people restored to their land.</li>\n  <li>v 19. After the death of the judge, the people would return to their apostate ways.</li>\n</ul>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Who were these judges? Judges were God's primary instrument to rule the people\nduring this era who were no longer obedient to the Law. \n\n</p><ul>\n  <li>Judges brought about conformity to the Law and destroyed alters of worship to Canaanite\n    gods. </li>\n  <li>Judges were political leaders. They led primarily as a military leader. </li>\n  <li>Judges were called by God. They were not appointed by the people. The people of Israel\n    rewarded them and their families with large shares of land and often cash gifts. Most\n    importantly, they were given the Spirit of God to enable them to be God's instrument\n    (3:10). It was God who raised up the judges, because the nation was a\n    \"theocracy.\" There was no central government. Unlike a king, the judge led\n    solely by charisma. They had no legal power. They could not enforce taxes or raise an army\n    by draft. They had no political power to act autonomously. They had only moral and\n    spiritual leadership. The Spirit would come upon them and they would be able to accomplish\n    God's will.</li>\n</ul>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Postscript: The end of the era of the judges. \n\n</p><ul>\n  <li>Concluding comment from Judges. Things are not well for Israel. There is substantial\n    tribal suspicion that has weakened Israel spiritually and militarily. The nation was\n    verging on moral anarchy. Note the refrain at the end of Judges, \"In those days there\n    was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes\" (Jud. 21:25).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Footnote on Ruth. The story is an analogy of God as go&#x92;el. The narrative takes\n    place during the judges era. Ruth establishes David's genealogy. In this way, Ruth\n    introduces us to David (Ruth 4:18-22). It shows God's faithfulness to a woman who was not\n    a Hebrew, but who migrated to Israel to become an example compassion and love. It stands\n    as a bridge between the turbulent time of the judges and the Golden Age of Israel under\n    the united monarchy.</li>\n</ul>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>From bad to worse. 1 Samuel 4: Israel's worst defeat. Read 4:1-18. \n\n</p><ul>\n  <li>Eli's sons Hophni and Phinehas are dead.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>30,000 Israeli soldiers dead</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The ark of the covenant is taken</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Jer. 7:12 says that Shiloh was invaded and the tabernacle destroyed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Eli, the judge and high priest is dead, leaving no successors</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What went wrong? \n\n</p><ul>\n  <li>Immediate cause. The Philistine invasion. They emerged in 1190 from the northern\n    coastline to invade Israel. We know much of them from Egyptian records. The \"Harris\n    Papyrus\" found in Egypt, shows Phililstine battles against Ramses III. These\n    invasions brought to an end Egypt's hegemony of the region. The Philistines were among the\n    first to use iron (1 Sam. 13). They were enormously powerful. Israel was no match for\n    their military hardware or skill.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Spiritual cause. Psalm 78:54-64. For the past 300 years, Israel had indulged in\n    spiritual harlotry. Because of her unfaithfulness, God withdrew his protection from her.\n    As a result, the military powers in the region had their way with Israel. The scripture\n    makes it clear that the central problem was a spiritual one, not military.</li>\n</ul>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>Samuel and the transition to monarchy (1&#x97;8) \n\n</p><ul>\n  <li>The pivotal person in God's plan is Samuel. It is through this priest/prophet/judge that\n    God will change the course of Israel's history.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Ch. 1. The spiritual legacy of Hannah.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Ch. 2. God honors Hannah's request.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Ch. 3. Samuel is called to be a prophet and priest.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Ch. 5-7 Samuel restores Israel spiritually and politically:</li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Ch. 5,6. The incident with the hemorrhoids and the return of the ark. A military victory\n      by God alone. This is the same type of deliverance as from Egypt (6:6).</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  </blockquote>Ch. 7. Samuel restores Israel spiritually (7:3-6).\n    \n  \n  \n\n<b>\n\n\n\n<strong>Israel under monarchy (1 Sam. 8&#x97;2\nChron.) </strong>\n\n</b><i>\n  <li>Israel demands a king. 8:1-9</li></i>. While it was God's intent to have a king (Deut. 17),\n    the problem was the motivation of the Israelites: \"like all the nations\" (v. 5).\n    God links the demand for a king with \"rejected Me for being king over them\" (v.\n    7). Remember that Israel was to be a theocracy. That is, that the only absolute monarch\n    was to be God. In this way, Israel was distinct from all of the other nations, being God's\n    possession, under both his rule and his protection. The problem with Israel was that they\n    were looking to a man, like Samuel, rather than to the Lord.\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>v. 9, \"the procedure of the king\" (see Deut. 17:14-20).</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <ul>\n      <li>An Israelite, chosen by God. The sign of God's selection is the anointing by the\n        prophet. They were to be the only legitimate king-makers. Solomon, for example, was chosen\n        by Nathan the prophet over the protests of Joab, chief of the army and Abiathar the High\n        Priest.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <ul>\n      <li>The king is to be a servant. The king must be obedient to his master. Israel is still to\n        be a theocracy. If they are obedient to Torah, God will bless them. If they are\n        disobedient, they are a poor king. This is why David is called \"my servant\n        David\" in Ps. 78, etc. David's desire was to do the will of God. The internal\n        character and spiritual condition of the king will have a direct bearing on the plight of\n        Israel. They stand as a symbol of the nation. When kings cease to be servants of the Lord,\n        and rule for reasons of self-interest, they jeopardize the nation. We'll see this in the\n        case of Solomon.</li></ul></blockquote></blockquote>\n    \n  \n\n\n\n<i>\n  <li>Saul and David contrasted</li></i>.\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Saul. 9:2 He was handsome and tall. This fit the ideal that the Israelites were seeking.\n      Yet, while Saul may have been a man's man, he was not God's man. </li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <ul>\n      <li>13:11-14. Samuel confronts Saul for assuming the priestly office. The end of Saul's\n        dynasty is assured. God is looking for a king \"after his own heart.\"</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>15:20-31. Samuel confronts Saul again. This time for taking the spoils of war for\n        himself, even though it was under the ban. For this, God removes Saul from being king.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Chapters 16-31 show the decline of Saul and the emergence of God's newly chosen king,\n        David. David is selected in ch. 16, right after Samuel&#x92;s denunciation of Saul.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <i>\n    <li>David: Man after God&#x92;s own he</li></i>art \n  </ul>\n  <blockquote>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Selection of David.

From a literary perspective, the book of 2 Samuel can be\n    divided into two sections. The first section, chapters 1-10 is David prospering under\n    God's blessing. Chapters 11-24 record David's sin and its consequences for his family.\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Chs. 1-6. David consolidates his kingdom. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <blockquote>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Chs. 1-5:5. Victory of David over Saul's family. On Saul's death, the Northern tribes\n        try to coronate a king from Saul's family. A war begins (3:1ff). But David prevails in the\n        civil war. In chapter 5, David is made king over all of Israel and the nation is united.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Ch. 5:6-16. David makes Jerusalem the capital city. It is between the North and the\n        South. This is a neutral ground in between the two divisions in the land. It is an attempt\n        to show the unity of the nation. But it is also a wise military move: Jerusalem is a city\n        on a hill, well protected. Waltke points to the analogy between David's choice of\n        Jerusalem and Washington's choice of DC.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Ch. 6. David moves the ark to Jerusalem.

This passage, along with Genesis 12/15 is\n  foundational to the message of the Old Testament.

But again, we see in the message of the prophets that God will raise\n    up Israel, his chosen nation. They will be preserved in the land as an example to the\n    nations of God's love and mercy. Even though there will be a time of dispossession, God\n    will restore his people in the land, because of his promise to David.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  \n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>v. 19 has been translated in many ways. The key word (NASB) is \"custom\", lit.\n    \"torah.\" Torah is virtually always translated \"law of God.\" What David\n    is doing in this passage is thanking God that he has chosen David's family as an\n    instrument in his \"torah\" or will (law) for man. This thesis is also developed\n    in much detail in the message of the prophets. The kingdom of David and the kingdom of God\n    are linked. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n  <i>\n  <li>David&#x92;s failure</li></i>. The final era of David's reign is marked by tragedy. 2 Sam. 11\n    is the turning point in the \"David\" narrative. \n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Describe the sin with Bathsheba and Uriah.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Nathan's confrontation: 2 Samuel 12:1-7 (Ps. 51:1-17).</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <ul>\n      <li>David is forgiven, but there will be consequences</li>\n      <li>The child dies (2 Sam. 12:22,23)</li>\n      <li>Violence in David's household: Amnon, the eldest son is killed by Absalom after Amnon\n        rapes Tamar. Kiliab has no record. He must have died young. Absalom tried to usurp David's\n        throne. He gained some popular support, but was killed by Joab. Adonijah received the\n        backing of Joab and Abiathar the High Priest in his bid to replace David. By there was no\n        prophetic sanction, so the kingdom went to Solomon. Adonijah revolted against Solomon and\n        was put to death.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n  <i>\n  <li>Reign of Solomon</li></i> (1 Kings 1-11)\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Solomon and David contrasted. Whereas David was a great military leader, Solomon was a\n      man of great administrative ability. With the borders secure, Solomon was able to develop\n      the industrial life of Israel. And this he did with extraordinary genius. He ushered in\n      the zenith of Israel's Golden Age, by broadening its economic base. He mined silver and\n      gold; he opened trade on the Red Sea; he opened caravan trade in the Arabian Peninsula.\n      Solomon essentially industrialized much of Israel's economy.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>In many ways, Solomon's spiritual life paralleled his father David's.

With all of his greatness, we can detect a deterioration in his spiritual and\n      moral state. Solomon developed serious heart problems. Even early in the Solomon\n      narrative, there are \"but\" clauses.\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Solomon built a great Temple for the Lord. It took 7 years to construct.

But Rehoboam does not listen\n    to the protests from the elders of the northern ten tribes. They demand an end to harsh\n    and abusive taxation and forced labor. The consequence of Rehoboam's failure to heed their\n    warnings was the permanent division of the nation. The northern tribes select Jeroboam,\n    son of Nebat as their king. The northern tribes carry the national name Israel, while the\n    southern kingdom uses the tribal name Judah.</li>\n\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The nation is divided in three ways:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <i>\n    <li>Religious division. </li></i>With the temple in Judah, the Levites flee to the southern\n      kingdom. This leaves the north without the temple and priests. Thus, Jeroboam sets up his\n      own high places for worship. This was the primary sin of the northern kingdom. It was a\n      pagan fertility cult that retained some of the forms and language of the historic Hebrew\n      faith. In the narrative of Kings, this cult is referred to as \"the sin of\n      Jeroboam.\" The deterioration of the northern kingdom from a religious perspective\n      took three turns. (i) The sin of Jeroboam, which is worshiping pagan gods in the mountains\n      (1 Kings 12:26-33). This continued until king Ahab married an non-Hebrew Jezebel. She\n      introduced the worship of Ba'al as the official religion of the northern kingdom. The\n      religion that Joshua was to destroy now becomes the official religion of God's people (see\n      1 Kings 16:30-33). (iii) King Jehu reformed Israel by ridding the nation of Ba'al worship,\n      but it was an incomplete reform. He merely returned the nation to the worship of the cult\n      introduced by Jeroboam (see 2 Kings 10:29-31).\n  </ul>\n  <ul>\n    <i>\n    <li>Political division.</li></i> There emerged two separate nations, with very little cooperation\n      between them. This is of crucial importance, because of the third national division....\n  </ul>\n  <ul>\n    <i>\n    <li>Military division.</li></i> There was no cooperation in battle between the two kingdoms.\n      Indeed, on more than one occasion, Israel and Judah formed military alliances against each\n      other. The division of the nation and the unfaithfulness to God brought about the\n      destruction of the northern kingdom in 722 BC under the power of the Assyrians (2 Kings\n      17:1-18). Central to Assyria's method of conquest was to force colonization and\n      intermarriage of the vanquished peoples. This leads to the complete destruction not only\n      of a national entity, but a cultural identity. That is why we speak today of the \"10\n      lost tribes of Israel.\" They literally vanish from significant history at this point.\n    \n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/assyrian.jpg\" alt=\"assyrian.jpg (10070 bytes)\" width=\"300\"><br>\n    </p></blockquote></blockquote>Assyrians execute conquered armies.\n    <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/kingjehu.jpg\" alt=\"kingjehu.jpg (6451 bytes)\" width=\"293\"><br>\n    </p>Jehu, king of Israel, pays tribute to\n    Shalmaneser III <br>\n    of Assyria (2 Kings 9-10).\n  \n\n\n<ul>\n  <li>While the southern kingdom, Judah, was more faithful to God, she too fell to pagan\n    fertility worship. But God dealt differently with Judah than with Israel. Remember that\n    God had promised to David that his seed would rule over Israel forever. Because God is\n    faithful to his promise, he preserved Judah even in its destruction. There were\n    significant reform movements in Judah that delayed the ultimate conquest of the kingdom\n    (Josiah's reform 2 Kings 22:1-13). Yet, like Israel, the unfaithfulness of Judah led to\n    the conquest of the kingdom by Babylon in 586 BC. Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Jerusalem,\n    looted and raised the Temple and led the royal family and others into exile in Babylon.</li>\n</ul>\n<i>\n\n</i><p>A Remnant Preserved \n\n</p><ul>\n  \n  <li>The prophet/historians who wrote Kings and Chronicles were careful to document that the\n    Davidic line remained intact even in captivity.

After\n    this period, Artaxerxes, the Persian king allows Nehemiah to lead a resettlement of the\n    Jerusalem.

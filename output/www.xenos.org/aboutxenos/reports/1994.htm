After experiencing a large-scale division, including the departure of well over a\nthousand people, we might have expected huge cutbacks in budget, programs and ministry.\nInstead, we have seen actual advances in giving and very little loss of programs or\nministry. </p>\n\n<p>1994 was the first year Xenos experienced the benefits of a voluntary pledge program\nand the Fiscal Support Team. The results have been impressive. Though overall attendance\nwas down by almost one third from 1993, our giving was stronger than ever! In fact, giving\nin 1994 was almost $30,000 above budget. Also, while our giving increased, our spending\nwas actually down from the previous year, so we ended the year with a sizable surplus\nwhich will help us to build our new facility. God has granted additional large-scale\ngrowth in Community Development, growth in course offerings and attendance, reduced\ndeficits at Calumet Christian School, significant growth in student outreach and final\npay-off of our building site--all while reaping a steady harvest in the main adult\noutreach meetings. </p>\n\n<p>Today, we can feel confident that we stand unified as a church under God's blessing,\nand that we are well situated for an aggressive ministry campaign during 1995. At the 1994\nFiscal Support Team retreat last month, the team elected to increase our ministries and\ngiving budget by 9% during 1995. </p>\n\n<p>Once again, we will present our assessment of each ministry division for the past year,\nalong with summaries of important goals for 1995. Each division will also report its\nbudgetary needs and staffing levels. In addition to the expansion described in the\nfollowing sections, the Fiscal Support Team voted to raise staff pay levels by an average\nof 4% and to raise elders and management team pay levels by an average of 3%. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/ops.htm\">OPERATIONS DIVISION</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The mission of Xenos Christian Fellowship's Operations Division is to\nfacilitate the ministries conducted by the other Xenos Christian Fellowship divisions.\nThis mission is accomplished by providing the other divisions with timely, accurate\nfinancial and statistical data, a mechanism ensuring effective inter-divisional\ncommunication, objective periodic evaluation of program effectiveness, human resources\nsupport, clean and comfortable facilities, and professional administrative support.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>SUMMARY OF 1994</h4>\n\n<p>The Operations Division managed 1994 expenditures to ensure a positive cash flow for\nthe year. We also developed a Ministry Assessment Process, completed our new database\ndesign, and developed a Salary Administration Plan. Additionally, we met all of our\ninternal reporting deadlines (monthly financial statements, budgets, etc.). As authorized\nby the Fiscal Support Team in early 1994, we hired Alan Burkholder as fiscal controller,\nwhich has contributed to substantial improvement in Xenos' accounting. We also hired Andy\nAult, a data professional, as our new data processing manager. During 1994, Andy completed\nour new database design. The Operations Division itself finished the year $45,000 or 7%\nbelow budget. </p>\n\n<h4>1995 PRIMARY GOALS</h4>\n\n<p>In addition to meeting ongoing goals such as providing timely monthly financial\nstatements, we plan to implement several new programs in 1995. The Human Resources\nDepartment will facilitate the evaluation of accredited ministry teams using the new\nMinistry Assessment Process. Additionally, we will implement a Salary Administration Plan\nand a new Employee Benefit Plans. These plans should result in greater fairness and\nenhanced security for our staff. The Data Processing Department will implement our newly\ndesigned, user-friendly database. This new database will reduce work-loads significantly\nand greatly enhance the efficiency of our organization. </p>\n\n<h4>BUDGET SUMMARY</h4>\n\n<table border=\"2\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">1994 Budget</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">1994 Projected Spending </td>\n    <td width=\"144\">1995 Budget</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">$695,000</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">$650,000</td>\n    <td width=\"144\">$756,000 </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>STAFFING DATA</h4>\n\n<table border=\"2\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">&#xA0;</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">Supervisory</td>\n    <td width=\"144\">Other </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">Full Time Equivalents</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">3.35 </td>\n    <td width=\"144\">5.2</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">1994 Budget</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">$95,390</td>\n    <td width=\"144\">$128,654 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">Averages</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">$28,474</td>\n    <td width=\"144\">$24,330 </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/evang.htm\">EVANGELISM DIVISION</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The mission of Xenos Christian Fellowship's Evangelism Division is to\nserve God by administrating an effective witness for Christ in Greater Columbus, other\ncities in the United States, and to unreached people groups throughout the world. This\nmission contributes to the mission of Xenos Christian Fellowship in that it encourages\npeople to respond to God's love through loving service toward Him and all people by\nproviding effective structures that will help facilitate Xenos members in their attempts\nto help those in Central Ohio establish a personal relationship with Christ, by mobilizing\nall Xenos members to carry out their specific roles in the evangelistic task, and by\nadministrating Xenos extra-local evangelistic projects, including cross cultural mission\nwork. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>SUMMARY OF 1994</h4>\n\n<p>Student outreach moved ahead with approximately 30% growth and dozens of salvations.\nThe development of student leadership seemed to be a main contributor to this growth.\nHigh-school and junior-high groups contributed most of the growth. As always, a\nsignificant number of college graduates entered the adult meetings. As authorized by the\nFiscal Support Team, we hired Tom Dixon as our part-time Student Outreach Assistant\nDirector. </p>\n\n<p>Adult Central Teaching attendance grew in 1994, even though we sustained significant\ndepartures in connection with our church division. This means, of course, that many new\npeople have begun attending these meetings in 1994. It is difficult to determine the\nactual number of these new people, but we believe outreach was good, especially during the\nlast half of the year. Attendance in recent weeks has reached 1600 adults, which\nrepresents a substantial upswing since this spring. \"Moms' Play Groups\" and\n\"Conversation &amp; Cuisine\" ministry teams grew to include over 30 groups, and\nhundreds of guests attended their events. </p>\n\n<p>The World Ministries (missions) Department accredited our Brazilian missionaries for\nfield work in Southern Brazil and established a Missions Mobilization Team. In a year of\nfinancial uncertainty, the Evangelism Division operated frugally, ending the year 10%\nunder budgeted spending. </p>\n\n<h4>1995 PRIMARY GOALS</h4>\n\n<p>Again, we will prioritize outreach to students. This year we will clarify our high\nschool strategy to accommodate the rapid growth on the north end. We will continue to\nemphasize student leadership, and develop a tracking program for all students. The\ninvestment in these young people should bear fruit in the future leadership needs of our\nchurch. </p>\n\n<p>In our Adult Special Outreach Department, we hope to mobilize another 10-15 outreach\ngroups, such as \"Moms' Play Groups\" and \"Conversation &amp; Cuisine.\"\nWe also plan to implement a tracking program that will help improve our follow-up efforts\nwith guests. </p>\n\n<p>In the World Ministries Department, we hope to form a World Ministries leadership team,\ndevelop a common strategy for foreign teams, and orient all the department's ministry\nteams around that strategy. We also hope to place our Brazilian missionaries on the field\nby June, 1995. </p>\n\n<h4>BUDGET SUMMARY</h4>\n\n<table border=\"2\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">1994 Budget</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">1994 Projected Spending </td>\n    <td width=\"144\">1995 Budget</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">$202,000</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">$189,000</td>\n    <td width=\"144\">$222,000 </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>STAFFING DATA</h4>\n\n<table border=\"2\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">&#xA0;</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">Supervisory</td>\n    <td width=\"144\">Other </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">Full Time Equivalents</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">3.4 </td>\n    <td width=\"144\">0.125</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">1994 Budget</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">$131,940</td>\n    <td width=\"144\">$3,000</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">Averages</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">$38,805</td>\n    <td width=\"144\">$24,000 </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n<h3>PASTORAL DIVISION</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The mission of Xenos Christian Fellowship's Pastoral Division is to\nassist Xenos members in drawing close to God by providing an environment suitable for long\nterm growth and service to them and their families. This mission is accomplished by\nproviding home fellowship groups, various ministries which strengthen family life,\nChristian education for children, and pastoral counseling and support to members in times\nof need. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>SUMMARY OF 1994</h4>\n\n<p>The Home Fellowship Department facilitated increases in home group attendance--from 685\nin 1993 to 835 in 1994. (Home groups do not include grounding groups or ministry teams.)\nBut overall home group involvement is down significantly from previous years.\nUnfortunately, a substantial number of people who completed grounding groups have not yet\njoined a new home group. This situation stands as a challenge for 1995. On the bright\nside, many new members joined home groups in 1994. We planted one new small group in 1994\nfrom an existing small group, and grew overall last year by seven groups. In order to meet\nthis growth, we increased our supervision of home groups and added Doug Patch to our\nstaff. We also experimented with the \"Meta-church\" supervision model and will\nevaluate it soon. This model assigns experienced volunteers to help in the oversight of\nhome groups. \"Home Group Enhancement Night\" is a new meeting for leaders and\nassistants, offering leaders encouragement, training, and new ideas. It has been a big\nsuccess. </p>\n\n<p>In the Family Ministry Department, OASIS continued to offer the quality ministry\ntypical of recent years. We also introduced our own elementary children's curriculum and\nlaunched a Vacation Bible School program during 1994. </p>\n\n<p>The Counseling Department ministered to about 500 lives this year through a counseling\nclass, counseling-oriented ministry teams, and actual counseling. We changed the focus of\nour individual counseling to short term, issue-directed counseling. Surveys show that\ncounselees view this new approach as helpful. Katey Downs, the Counseling Department\ndirector, provides supervision to 6 ministry teams that offer help in many areas,\nincluding marriage communication, pre-marriage instruction, pregnancy loss, post abortion\nissues, and substance abuse. Kevin Furno was also added to the counseling team. Finally,\nwe completed the formation of a Grievance and Mediation team. </p>\n\n<p>At Calumet Christian School, we hired Dave Glover as our principal early in 1994. He\ncontinued the work of streamlining the school by reducing costs and administrative staff\n(begun earlier by interim principal Cindy Grover). As a result of their work, Xenos\nenjoyed subsidy savings and parents also experienced a reduction in tuition. We repaired\nthe deteriorating facial wall and sidewalks for far less than anticipated. The\nadministration stabilized the atmosphere of unrest at the school with an influx of\nministry-oriented speakers and prayer meetings for staff and students. </p>\n\n<p>Overall, the Pastoral Division finished 1994 11% under budgeted spending. The cost of\npastoral ministries fell for the third consecutive year without sacrificing quality\nministry. In 1992, the division spent $339,000. 1994 costs will come in about $100,000\nless than that amount. This savings has been realized for the most part by enhanced fiscal\nmanagement at Calumet Christian School and OASIS. We also decreased spending by making\nchanges in the Counseling Department and terminating the Christian Community Meeting. </p>\n\n<h4>1995 PRIMARY GOALS</h4>\n\n<p>This year, the Home Fellowship Department will attempt to enhance home group placement\nservices for those who are not currently in a home group. We are concerned for the several\nhundred Xenos members who are no longer involved in home groups as they once were, and we\nwant to do everything we can to help them resume this important feature of their Christian\nwalks. We will call on the home group leaders to help us \"roll out the red\ncarpet\" to these folks as well as to new members. We also hope to plant more home\ngroups this year so that everyone who wants to be in a home group has a place. </p>\n\n<p>Kathy Steinman, our OASIS Director, will go to full time status in 1995. We plan to\nincrease the number of OASIS classes and reduce crowding by acquiring more space and\nrecruiting additional classroom volunteers. We will continue to develop our own\ncurriculum, and we plan to offer another Vacation Bible School. </p>\n\n<p>Calumet Christian School plans to keep the tuition cost to parents at a minimum.\nAlthough a slight increase is planned (typically less than $3 per month), tuition will\nstill be lower than two years ago for grades 1-8. We have just begun supplementing both\nremedial and advanced learning by adding an educational van funded by state money. We\nexpect that educational scores will remain high or even climb again this year. We plan to\nform a new school board in 1995. We also plan to establish a marketing task force early\nthis year for maximizing enrollment. </p>\n\n<p>In the Counseling Department, Katey Downs will again offer the course \"Biblical\nFramework for Human Emotions.\" She will be developing some new class material on\n\"Marriage Readiness\" and on \"Resolving Divorce.\" </p>\n\n<h4>BUDGET SUMMARY</h4>\n\n<table border=\"2\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">1994 Budget</td>\n    <td width=\"211\">1994 Projected Spending </td>\n    <td width=\"125\">1995 Budget</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">$273,000</td>\n    <td width=\"211\">$241,000</td>\n    <td width=\"125\">$259,000 </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>STAFFING DATA: CALUMET CHRISTIAN SCHOOL</h4>\n\n<table border=\"2\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">&#xA0;</td>\n    <td width=\"211\">Supervisory &amp; Professional </td>\n    <td width=\"125\">Other</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">Full Time Equivalents</td>\n    <td width=\"211\">14.3 </td>\n    <td width=\"125\">7.6</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">1994 Budget</td>\n    <td width=\"211\">$276,675</td>\n    <td width=\"125\">$89,850</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">Averages</td>\n    <td width=\"211\">$19,375</td>\n    <td width=\"125\">$11,732 </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>STAFFING DATA: PASTORAL DIVISION</h4>\n\n<table border=\"2\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">&#xA0;</td>\n    <td width=\"211\">Supervisory</td>\n    <td width=\"125\">Other </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">Full Time Equivalents</td>\n    <td width=\"211\">4.4 </td>\n    <td width=\"125\">.4</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">1994 Budget</td>\n    <td width=\"211\">$127,300</td>\n    <td width=\"125\">$4,600</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">Averages</td>\n    <td width=\"211\">$28,934</td>\n    <td width=\"125\">$11,500 </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/equip.htm\">EQUIPPING DIVISION</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The mission of the Equipping Division is to provide the educational\nresources necessary for Xenos members to understand and apply biblical truth. This mission\nis accomplished by offering diverse approaches and course offerings for our adult\neducation program, providing information resources for the church and relevant publics,\ndeveloping programs for training leaders and workers, and facilitating the development of\nnew and existing ministries. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>SUMMARY OF 1994</h4>\n\n<p>This year, we completed the majority of grounding groups and began a new emphasis on\nthe Christian Principles Class. We have enhanced the content level in this course and\nassigned some of Xenos' best teachers to communicate this content. Currently, we have 90\nstudents enrolled in three classes. </p>\n\n<p>Academic Resources exceeded it's projected 1,000-person enrollment in adult education\ncourse offerings. Response to the 5-week class structure was positive. This structure\nallowed us to offer more courses each quarter. </p>\n\n<p>The Study Center expanded services, including book lending and a monthly \"Critical\nConcerns\" series. Membership remained stable this year. </p>\n\n<p>We formed the \"Crossroads Project,\" an apologetics ministry, in cooperation\nwith the City Gate ministry team. This ministry's first project will focus on\npostmodernism and current scientific challenges to the Christian world-view. In order to\nlaunch this ministry, we completed a substantial body of research, offered an 8-week\nclass, and submitted a manuscript on postmodernism for publication. </p>\n\n<p>We exceeded our budgeted expense by 4%. This was due mainly to a substantial shortfall\nin anticipated revenue from Ministry NetWorking. </p>\n\n<h4>1995 PRIMARY GOALS</h4>\n\n<p>In the coming year, we intend to build on ministries that took shape in 1994. We will\ncontinue to offer services of general interest to the fellowship at the Study Center.\nThese services will include both the \"Critical Concerns\" series, and the\naddition of word-processing software, two new computers and a printer. We hope to enroll\n1200 in our numerous adult education courses. The \"Crossroads Project\" will be a\ncentral focus for the division in 1995. We will complete two manuscripts for publication,\nand present at least two apologetics conferences. The first conference will be held at\nEastern Michigan University on March 9-11. An additional conference is scheduled for Ohio\nState University in early May. The ministry will also begin production of a\ndocumentary-style video series on \"Apologetics for the 21st century.\" </p>\n\n<h4>BUDGET SUMMARY</h4>\n\n<table border=\"2\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">1994 Budget</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">1994 Projected Spending </td>\n    <td width=\"144\">1995 Budget</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">$130,000</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">$137,000</td>\n    <td width=\"144\">$150,000 </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>STAFFING DATA</h4>\n\n<table border=\"2\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">&#xA0;</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">Teaching &amp; Supervisory </td>\n    <td width=\"144\">Support Staff</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">Full Time Equivalents</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">2.6 </td>\n    <td width=\"144\">2.8</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">1994 Budget</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">$88,967</td>\n    <td width=\"144\">$61,875 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"192\">Averages</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">$34,218</td>\n    <td width=\"144\">$22,098 </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n<h3>SERVICE DIVISION</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The mission of the Service Division of Xenos Christian Fellowship is to\nserve God by providing practical service to the Xenos, non-Christian and broader Christian\ncommunities. It contributes to the mission and vision of Xenos by encouraging its servants\nto respond to God's love through loving sacrifice toward him and all people. This mission\nis accomplished by creating and administering in-house service ministries, carrying out\nXenos' strategy for community development, and building working relationships with other\norganizations, especially churches. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>SUMMARY OF 1994</h4>\n\n<p>World Vision also presented their annual \"Mustard Seed\" award to Xenos\nChristian Fellowship as the single most outstanding American church in community\ndevelopment ministry. Urban Concern was able to exceed their fundraising goal by $74,000.\nThey obtained and remodeled a laundromat and a house in South Linden for use in the\nexpanded After School and Bible Study ministries. Jim Swearingen taught a Poverty Seminar\nand was chosen for the board of directors for the well-known national organization, the\nChristian Community Development Association. </p>\n\n<p>The Internal Service Department conducted successful fellowship-wide and Servant Team\nretreats, and assumed supervision of the Servant Team. The External Relations Department\nhelped provide four projects, including the \"Veritas Forum\" and the Dan Allender\nConference. The Service Division ended the year under budget in spending by about 10%.\nUnfortunately, we were unable to accredit four additional ministry teams we had planned to\naccredit in 1994. </p>\n\n<h4>1995 PRIMARY GOALS</h4>\n\n<p>This year, the Community Service Department is planning expansion in several areas.\nUrban Concern will be attempting to launch a low-income housing project while remodeling a\ntwin single in South Linden for use by the Bible Study and After School ministries. They\nwill also introduce a Job Readiness program for inner-city youth. </p>\n\n<p>The External Relations Department hopes to provide three projects such as Veritas\nForum, while participating in the Crossroads Project (Xenos' apologetics ministry), where\nthey will provide logistical support. The Internal Service Department will again seek to\nprovide enjoyable Fellowship and Servant Team retreats while managing the Servant Team for\nefficiency and quality. </p>\n\n<h4>BUDGET SUMMARY: SERVICE DIVISION</h4>\n\n<table border=\"2\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"163\">1994 Budget</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">1994 Projected Spending </td>\n    <td width=\"125\">1995 Budget</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"163\">$128,000</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">$121,000</td>\n    <td width=\"125\">$138,000 </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>BUDGET SUMMARY: URBAN CONCERN</h3>\n\n<table border=\"2\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"163\">1994 Budget</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">1994 Projected Spending </td>\n    <td width=\"125\">1995 Budget</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"163\">$354,000</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">$329,000</td>\n    <td width=\"125\">$421,000 </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>STAFFING DATA: SERVICE DIVISION</h4>\n\n<table border=\"2\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"163\">&#xA0;</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">Supervisory</td>\n    <td width=\"125\">Other </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"163\">Full Time Equivalents</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">.8</td>\n    <td width=\"125\">.2</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"163\">1994 Budget</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">$25,700</td>\n    <td width=\"125\">$3,600 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"163\">Averages</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">$32,125</td>\n    <td width=\"125\">$18,000 </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>STAFFING DATA: URBAN CONCERN</h4>\n\n<table border=\"2\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"163\">&#xA0;</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">Supervisory</td>\n    <td width=\"125\">Other </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"163\">Full Time Equivalents</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">3</td>\n    <td width=\"125\">6</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"163\">1994 Budget</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">$104,180</td>\n    <td width=\"125\">$130,200</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"163\">Averages</td>\n    <td width=\"192\">$34,726</td>\n    <td width=\"125\">$21,700 </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n<h3>SUMMARY &amp; VISION</h3>\n\n<p>Xenos members and leaders have never viewed our group as \"a nice place to hang out\nand raise a family,\" although it certainly is. The point of our existence is beyond\nthat which is pleasing to us. We exist to serve God and to accomplish a mission he has\nentrusted to us. We live in an ocean of lost people desperately in need of Christ and his\nlove. We cannot save the world or bring to an end the trials even of our own community.\nBut we can do the part that God has called us to--reaching lost people, serving them with\nGod's love and raising up disciples who understand why serving God is important. </p>\n\n<p>In a day when virtually every institution in society, including churches, exists to\nplease their constituency, Xenos stands for a completely different reason. We are not here\nto please either our own members or those outside the church, but to equip and facilitate\nthose who want to serve God according to his calling. Today, Xenos fields a large Servant\nTeam of highly committed Christian workers; workers who have understood the stakes in\nspiritual warfare, who have made the commitment, who have done the work, who have said\n\"no\" to self, who have received the training, and who stand ready to accomplish\nministry to others, even of the most sophisticated sort. This year we look forward to\nexpanding our Servant Team by adding new qualified members. </p>\n\n<p>During the past several years, Xenos has explored, in a deep way, the concept of the\nchurch as a place of healing. But while we have seen the need to help members find God's\nhealing, we have consciously turned away from that definition of our church. Whatever\nhealing or comfort we receive is not the main point. Today, we realize we are here to\naccomplish our mission, to give ourselves up in love for the sake of others, just as\nChrist gave himself up for us. We are here to come out of our cultural niche to meet the\nlost world in their niche. We are here to learn to speak the language of the people in our\nfield of ministry. We are here to love others for the sake of Christ. As Jesus himself\nsaid, \"&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but\nwhoever loses his life for me and for the gospel will save it.\" </p>\n\n<p>This year, we will likely break ground on at least part of our facility. We need a\nfacility to headquarter our ministry and to welcome more people to join us. Our journey to\nthis goal has been a painful one, full of self-sacrifice. God will use this journey not\nonly to teach us what self-sacrifice is, but to bring in people from all over the country\nto learn apologetics and evangelism. Our \"Crossroads Project\" and our nationally\npublished books will open the door for new types of ministry for all of us, just as Urban\nConcern and related community service ministries have opened doors for wonderful ministry\nduring their eight-year tenure. Let's pray that, eight years from now, we are able to look\nback at the formation and launching of Crossroads with the same sense of gratification and\nthankfulness. </p>\n\n<p>We call on all believers who attend Xenos to join us in our mission. God has brought\nyou here so you may take one of the oars and begin to pull. No matter what your gifting or\ncapabilities, God can use you as a vital part of the mission of this important church. </p>\n\n<p>One area where we can all help is in our prayer support for ministries in the church,\nincluding those in which we are not personally involved. Another is by joining in the\nfinancing of these crucial ministries. Unless 70% of our budget goal is pledged by the end\nof February, the elders are authorized to cut the budget accordingly. Please consider\nmaking your personal decision today to join the rest of us by making out a pledge for the\ncoming year. Your pledge says you are truly aboard, you believe in our vision, and you\nwant to help. Your pledge is not a promise written in blood, but a goal and an intention,\nundertaken in faith, to do your part as the Lord prospers you. </p>\n\n<p>Thank God for the opportunity to serve him!<br>\n</p>\n&#xA0;\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Xenos Christian Fellowship\n1994 Annual Report","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/aboutxenos/reports/1994.htm"}

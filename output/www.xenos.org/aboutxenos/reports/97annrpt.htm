Therefore, Xenos Christian\n      Fellowship exists to help people learn how to draw close to God. This work begins by\n      inviting people to receive the gift of forgiveness offered through Christ.</p>\n      <p>We are committed to fostering spiritual growth by encouraging people to respond to\n      God&#x92;s love through loving service toward God and all people. Specifically, we direct\n      our resources to serving the family, the non-Christian community locally and\n      internationally, and the broader Christian community.</p>\n    </dir>\n    <b></b><p>Our Church Vision</p>\n    <dir><b>\n      </b><p>Xenos has set out to build a highly trained, sophisticated,\n      caring, leadable, cohesive, committed, and flexible work force of Christian servants who\n      continually strive to serve the Lord and do his will.</p><dir>\n        <b></b><p>Overview</p>\n      </dir>\n    </dir>\n    <p>Growth in attendance has been a sore point in Xenos since 1992. This year, we appear to\n    have grown by around 600 people since the same time last year! Compared to last\n    fall&#x92;s attendance of around 2400, this represents 25% growth in one year. That rate\n    compares favorably with the best years of growth our church has ever seen. Opening the new\n    building and excellent performance in student outreach seem to be the main outward factors\n    leading to the phenomenal growth. The initial surge of curiosity about the new building\n    appears to have subsided, making today&#x92;s attendance a fairly reliable number.</p>\n    <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/97arpchart.gif\" width=\"362\"> In addition to growth in attendance, Xenos has\n    increased its budget. The fiscal support team has increased spending substantially during\n    the past three years, partly in recognition of the following facts: </p><ul>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Xenos has been under-funded in the past, including underpaid staff.</li>\n        <li>Xenos has been disorganized and short handed in administrative staff.</li>\n        <li>Xenos has been unacceptably weak in missions.</li>\n        <li>Our student outreach had to be resuscitated, partly by using paid staff.</li>\n      </ul>\n    </ul>\n    <p>These increases were voted in faith that we would soon see growth resulting from our\n    ministry initiatives and from our building campaign. This year, we see the increased\n    spending bearing fruit in all needed areas as well as growth. </p>\n    <p>This year, instead of trying to figure out how to <i>get</i> the ball rolling, we have\n    to think about increase calculated to <i>keep</i> the ball rolling. We need to be\n    forward-thinking to maintain our ministry momentum without again getting caught behind as\n    we were several years ago. This is why the Fiscal Support Team passed an aggressive growth\n    budget again for 1998&#x97;a plan that should keep us abreast of all that God wants to do\n    in the church. Below we survey that plan, along with synopses of the past year&#x92;s\n    developments divided by the six divisions in the church. </p>\n    <p>Notice that we have changed the divisions around a bit, moving the External Relations\n    division to department status and dividing the former Evangelism and Missions division\n    into the Evangelism division (Central Teachings, Adult outreach, External relations) and\n    the Missions division (World Ministries, Urban Concern, International Student Services,\n    and Domestic Missions). This represents a shift of emphasis from external relations to\n    missions and evangelism. Doug Patch moved over from his position as coordinator of the old\n    External Relations division to coordinator the new Evangelism division. Dave Merker will\n    coordinate the new Missions division. Since the change was made around the end of 1997,\n    the review of 1997 is presented under the old arrangement, while the goals for 1998 are\n    presented under the new arrangement.</p>\n    <b></b><p>Evangelism &amp; Missions Division </p><dir><b>\n      </b><p>The Evangelism &amp; Missions Division provides an effective\n      witness for Christ to our local community, to extra-local communities and to unreached\n      people groups throughout the world.</p>\n    </dir>\n    <b></b><p>Dave Merker, Coordinator</p>\n    <p>SUMMARY OF 1997</p>\n    <p>This division was responsible for transitioning the Adult Central Teachings\n    to their new home with the opening of the Main Campus facility. We kicked off the move\n    with a \"Grand Opening\" event. During the three Grand Opening meetings about 4700\n    adults and over 2000 children showed up.</p>\n    <p>The Grand Opening was a festive affair. Those in attendance must have consumed about a\n    ton of tasty chicken wings and other culinary delights, and we gave away scores of Xenos\n    mugs and <i>Christianity: The Faith That Makes Sense</i> books. We really appreciate all\n    the help offered by dozens and dozens of volunteers.</p>\n    <p>On other fronts, we are happy to report that Evangelism/Missions adult outreach teams\n    grew in numbers. About 1000 guests attended \"Conversation &amp; Cuisine\" and\n    \"Playgroup Network\" events in 1997. Large numbers of these guests are now\n    involved in Central Teachings and home groups.</p>\n        <p>On the mission front, we sent two couples to Eastern Europe. We also were \n          able to visit our teams in Southeast Asia and Brazil. And we accredited \n          Mark &amp; Steph Watkins who  will be serving in Brazil. </p>\n    <p>Many new Christians gave their testimonies at this year&#x92;s baptism. One hundred\n    adults stepped out in faith to publicly proclaim their relationship with Christ. It was a\n    sweet night of rejoicing&#x97;even though many, many others could have been baptized!</p>\n    <p>Urban Concern launched a new an adult outreach ministry called \"Word in the\n    Hood.\" Also, the craftsmen involved with our low-income housing program completed\n    renovation of a house as others helped prepare some families for home ownership. Our first\n    family is about to complete the process of qualifying to buy a house.</p>\n    <p>Other Urban Concern programs had a good year. For instance, the \"Kids on\n    Track\" job readiness program was offered to about 35 youths. The South Linden Bible\n    Study reached an all time attendance high in October when about 200 youths came out. And\n    more than a dozen families participated in the Home Buyers club.</p>\n    <b></b><p>Missions Division </p><dir><b>\n      </b><p>The Missions Division provides an effective cross-cultural\n      witness for Christ locally, extra-locally and throughout the world.</p>\n    </dir>\n    <b></b><p>Dave Merker, Coordinator</p>\n    <p>1998 PRIMARY GOALS</p>\n         \n        <p>In 1998, the Missions Division will pursue the goal of \"upsetting \n          the world\" for Christ (see Acts 17:6). We&#x92;ll do this in part \n          by sending additional workers to existing foreign ministries including \n          Mark &amp; Steph Watkins to Brazil, one couple to Southeast Asia, and \n          one to Eastern \n          Europe. We hope to formally accredit a team to be sent to Taiwan, \n          a new field for Xenos. Finally, we&#x92;ll do some major research to \n        identify a new unreached people group to reach out to.</p>\n    <p>Launching our short-term sending strategy should also help the cause. We have plans to\n    cooperate with Student Ministries to send a couple of student teams to foreign countries.\n    And we&#x92;re working on a plan to send one adult/family team out to do a short-term\n    project.</p>\n    <p>Short-term mission trips heighten awareness about the need for Christ in other corners\n    of the world. They enrich our understanding and vision for what God is doing to reach the\n    lost outside of central Ohio. Many career missionaries got their vision for world\n    evangelization after participating in a short-term mission.</p>\n    <p>To be effective at upsetting the world for Christ, we need to be equipped. So several\n    key missions staff and leaders will engage in some serious study this year. We&#x92;ll\n    attend some conferences and take some seminary classes. This should help us get a better\n    feel for what&#x92;s new in missions. We want to stay on the cutting edge.</p>\n    <p>Local cross-cultural work should flourish this year. With the generous funding supplied\n    by the Fiscal Support Team and other Xenos givers, we should be able to provide quite a\n    bit of help to our ministry to international students. We&#x92;re looking to see their\n    Bible study attendance increase by more than 25 people. In fact we&#x92;re looking to see\n    the \"Word in the Hood\" (Urban Concern&#x92;s new adult outreach ministry), the\n    South Linden Bible Study, First Frontier (Dayton home group), Zanesville, and adult prison\n    ministries all grow significantly this next year.</p>\n    <p>Urban Concern programs will continue to press ahead with ministry to the needy of South\n    Linden. Some of our well-established and better-known ministries include the After-School\n    and One-on-One programs. We should see expansion in each of these this next year. In\n    addition, we&#x92;re looking for great things from some relatively new Urban Concern\n    ministries. Low income housing should renovate and sell more houses, young adult ministry\n    houses should grow, more research should go into starting an inner city school, and we\n    should complete development of a job training and placement program. </p><dir>\n      <dir>\n        <b></b><p>Student Ministries Division</p>\n      </dir>\n      <p>The Student Ministries division seeks to reach non-Christian\n      students for Christ while developing workers and leaders for Christ's church.</p>\n    </dir>\n    <b></b><p>Joe Botti, Coordinator</p>\n    <p>SUMMARY OF 1997</p>\n    <p>From September 1996 to September 1997, God gave us 22% overall growth in our\n    junior high, senior high and college ministries. We are thankful for the growth in all of\n    our groups, even though it is lower than our 36% growth goal. We are still hoping to do\n    better this coming year by growing an additional 40%. </p>\n    <p>The OASIS program accomplished a major goal: moving into the new facility! Because the\n    number of classrooms was going to almost double, teacher recruitment was a top\n    priority&#x97;but with God&#x92;s help we met the goal. And, with the increased space,\n    this program grew by 131 children since November of 1996. Also, after three hard years, we\n    completed the curriculum development.</p>\n    <p>Xenos Christian Schools is now a reality and the name of our new school system! Because\n    of growing enrollment at Calumet Christian School, the administration was able to start an\n    additional school on our main campus&#x97;Xenos Christian School. We accommodated scores\n    of additional students through this newly state-chartered school. </p>\n    <p>Our new Melee program, a five-week summer outreach to fourth and fifth grade boys, was\n    a tremendous success. Each week, a majority of our Xenos kids brought their unchurched\n    friends. In 1998, we plan to sponsor this program on a monthly basis.</p>\n    <p>At the junior high level, we&#x92;re seeing record numbers in the cell groups, the Blow\n    Out meetings, and JAM. Since last year, our large meeting, the Blow Out, grew by 34\n    students, and almost every one was unchurched. 25 of them also reported to have received\n    Christ! Many other new students still need salvation and more on-going body life in our\n    cell groups.</p>\n    <p>The high school group moved into our new student facility just over a year ago, and the\n    fruit has been incredible. Due to the hard work of our staff, volunteers, and space, we\n    are seeing over 150 high schoolers pile into our new facility each week&#x97;something not\n    possible with our smaller building. Since last year, the group has grown by 64 students,\n    and most of this growth is unchurched students! 25 of these students said they received\n    Christ, most of whom joined a cell group. The challenge this year will be to incorporate\n    the latest batch of new students into our cell groups.</p>\n        <p>Our college outreach experienced surprisingly slow growth early this fall, \n          but since then growth has picked up some. Since last year at this time, \n          home churches have grown by 28 students, while our Central Teaching \n          has only grown by 10. Dennis McCallum became the new director since \n          our previous director, Scot McCallum, was called to the Eastern Europe \n        Mission Team.</p>\n    <b></b><p>1998 PRIMARY GOALS</p>\n    <p>We want to fill up our new facilities! This year we hope to add hundreds to\n    our student programs while taking measures to manage the growth and build effectively.</p>\n    <p>At OASIS, we want to successfully manage the program growth. We are adding an assistant\n    director to help us in this area. </p>\n    <p>At Xenos Christian School, we hope to increase enrollment by 50 more students and\n    expand three more grades (3rd, 4th, and 5th) at the north campus. We will also introduce\n    new and improved curriculum in Math and Language Arts.</p>\n    <p>The junior high programs should grow by 50 students. In order to secure this growth, we\n    need improvements in follow-up and meeting programming. A part-time hire will help us\n    here. The leadership hopes to build solidly by planting between four and six cell groups.</p>\n    <p>The main goal for high school work will be to incorporate all of the new outreach. To\n    that end, we hope to recruit several college age and adult workers to lead the several new\n    cell groups waiting to be planted. If our recruitment effort fails, we will have to invent\n    new cell group paradigms.</p>\n    <p>This year we hope to enroll 10 extra-local students in our Real Life program. This\n    program, an alternative to Christian college education, involves living in a college\n    ministry house, taking our course work (Christian Principles, etc.), attending a local\n    college (OSU or Columbus State) and being mentored by an adult member in Xenos. </p>\n    <p>To remedy the slow growth in our in our college ministry, we will multiply home\n    churches and ministry houses. We hope to plant 2 new home churches and 7 ministry houses. </p><dir>\n      <dir>\n        <b></b><p>Pastoral Division</p>\n      </dir>\n      <p>The Xenos Pastoral Division provides Christian community and\n      spiritual care to Xenos members, encouraging them toward normative Christian maturity.</p>\n    </dir>\n    <b></b><p>Phil Franck, Coordinator</p>\n    <p>SUMMARY OF 1997</p>\n    <p>Home group attendance is up 150 over last year at this time. This year, we\n    planted 8 new home groups and gained a ninth through assimilating an existing group.\n    (These figures do not include the several hundred more attending student and adult\n    outreach groups). This is more pastoral division home groups planted in one year than in\n    the previous five years! We did lose 3 groups, mostly because they were smaller, weakened\n    groups hitting bad circumstances. We now have 59 pastoral home groups.</p>\n    <p>The number of people at Central Teachings inquiring about getting into home groups has\n    sky-rocketed. We had the same number of inquirees in the first 2 months of our new\n    facility as we had seen in the previous 12 months at the old building. Between September 1\n    (when we opened the new facility) and the week before Christmas, we've had 188 inquiries\n    about home groups. Of that number, we've referred roughly 3 out of 5 inquirers to groups\n    and confirmed placement of roughly 1 in 5 so far.</p>\n    <p>We hired John Cleary, who has contributed strongly in home group connection work. We\n    have seen a number of leaders return to a personal discipleship paradigm. This is a good\n    sign of health, but we need more here. Danny Walker's quarterly enhancement nights grew\n    this year and have served our leaders well, invigorating them with the vision for growing\n    and planting their groups. Over half of our home groups have drafted plans to plant their\n    groups, and we anticipate more such plant plans.</p>\n    <p>The Servant Team grew by 66 this year to a total of 489 deacons. The flow of new\n    deacons has been steady, and demonstrates wide-spread vitality in the church. </p>\n    <p>In the counseling department, we added Bruce Shively to the staff as a part-time\n    counselor, and he and Katey Downs saw over 200 different individuals or couples this year.</p>\n    <b></b><p>1998 PRIMARY GOALS</p>\n    <p>This year is the big year for growth. The two big growth issues are: </p><ol>\n      <li>Home groups need to grow by incorporating people from Central Teachings as well as\n        through group-generated outreach. Many groups have room to grow, or with some adjustments,\n        could make the room to take in new people. Even though we hope to increase our Home Group\n        Connection \"presence\" at the Central Teachings to further help people get into\n        home groups, Xenos members should make a point to reach out and warmly meet new people\n        sitting around them at Central Teachings. </li>\n      <li>With the opening of the new building, we need more new home groups. We hope to plant 8\n        more new groups in 1998, and 12-15 more in 1999. It will be crucial to develop Christian\n        workers who are willing to trust God to help lead new groups. These are a couple of the\n        greatest needs of the church for 1998 if we are to capitalize on the opportunity afforded\n        by our new facility. Along these lines, we will hire a full time Home Group\n        Supervisor/Incorporator to help the many new people find groups and to oversee new groups\n        next year.</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>We expect another strong flow of new Servant Team members this year to build on an\n    already strong core in the church. </p>\n    <p>On Wednesday nights from 7:00 till 7:25, we will begin a Corporate Worship singing time\n    at the Main Campus. This time will give all of us who want to praise God through singing\n    an additional opportunity to do so. It will also be a great way for Wednesday course\n    students to start their evenings.</p>\n    <p>Besides offering support to our own members, we will develop new inroads into our\n    community by publicizing the <i>DivorceCare </i>series, and \"SPEC'L\" (for single\n    parents).</p>\n    <p>We hope to build on the successful parent/child breakfast Bible study concept by doing\n    more events this year. This will help parents build better spiritual and relational bonds\n    with their children.</p>\n    <p>We will also continue to hold events in which people from all around the fellowship can\n    mix and meet other people, namely, the cinema review nights, and the coffee house nights\n    at the Study Center. </p><dir>\n      <dir>\n        <b></b><p>Equipping Division</p>\n      </dir>\n      <p>The Equipping Division provides educational resources for\n      Christians to understand and apply biblical truth to their lives, and to prepare for a\n      fruitful ministry.</p>\n    </dir>\n    <b></b><p>Jim Leffel, Coordinator</p>\n    <p>SUMMARY OF 1997</p>\n    <p>1997 was an exciting year for the Equipping Division. We met our goal of\n    1400 annual registrants and 6 course offerings per quarter in the adult education program.\n    We currently have our largest Christian Principles class ever of 140, up from the 110\n    we&#x92;ve averaged over the previous two years. This is a sign of spiritual vitality for\n    Xenos, as many of these young Christians will become active contributors to ministry teams\n    and members of the Servant Team. Enrollment in Challenge Groups remains high this year\n    with over half of the Servant Team now involved.</p>\n    <p>The Study Center has settled into our new facility. Along with an extraordinary view of\n    our property, new furniture and a cozy fireplace, we also have greatly enhanced tools for\n    study. Three Pentium computers, loaded with state-of-the-art Bible study programs, access\n    the Internet and Windows 95 make the Study Center a complete resource for individual and\n    group study. We are concerned about low levels of use over the past couple of years. There\n    will be some changes in 1998 that we hope will facilitate greater use of these fantastic\n    resources.</p>\n    <p>Ministry NetWorking launched another successful ministry fair this year. It was very\n    well received, both by the ministry teams that had a booth and by the hundreds of people\n    who showed up to see the broad range of ministries Xenos is involved in.</p>\n    <p>The Crossroads Project, Xenos&#x92; apologetics ministry, had a very busy year. We held\n    a \"Death of Truth\" conference in Denver and had a number of articles published\n    in Christian magazines and journals. The Summer Evangelism Institute exceeded our\n    expectations. Over 1,000 people participated in the 9 day program that featured two\n    prominent Christian apologists, William Lane Craig and Grant Osborne. </p>\n    <p><b>1998 PRIMARY GOALS</b></p>\n    <p>In 1998, the Equipping Division will build on the programs and services\n    developed over the past few years. The adult education department is offering new courses\n    to supplement the existing array of options and has set a goal of 1600 registrants for\n    classes. We are pleased by the quality of our instructional staff, including all of the\n    elders and many key leaders. Patrice McCormac offers the Christian Principles course on\n    Friday mornings and there are two sections of the course on Wednesday night. We have\n    launched a new program to provide high level biblical and theological training for key\n    leaders and teachers. This intensive seminary level program offers an alternative to\n    leaving church-based ministry and fellowship to attend seminary.</p>\n    <p>The Study Center has set an ambitious 200 member growth for 1997. With the substantial\n    support given to the Study Center by the Fiscal Support Team, we believe that the location\n    and enhanced resources will be increasingly attractive to Xenos members. We are also\n    putting some new programs in place that should attract interest both from within the\n    fellowship and in the local Christian community.</p>\n    <p>Ministry NetWorking will undergo some changes in keeping with Xenos&#x92; changing\n    needs. Director Mike Sullivan will provide web site services to ministry teams, organize\n    two ministry fairs and will reinstate the personal consultation service for those who\n    complete the NetWorking seminar.</p>\n    <p>The Crossroads Project will promote a speakers&#x92; bureau consisting of <i>Death of\n    Truth</i> contributors as an alternative to the more costly \"Death of Truth\"\n    conference. We continue to do research and develop new materials that are designed to help\n    Christians more effectively communicate biblical Christianity to a postmodern culture. The\n    Summer Evangelism Institute will be a 4-day event this year. We are excited to welcome\n    J.P. Moreland and Walter Bradley, two outstanding Christian scholars and evangelists, as\n    guest lecturers. </p><dir>\n      <dir>\n        <b></b><p>External Relations Division</p>\n      </dir>\n      <p>External Relations desires to impact the world for Christ by\n      facilitating the equipping of the Christian community beyond Xenos by providing\n      promotional and logistical support to Xenos equipping projects, by managing our World Wide\n      Web sites, and by cooperating with other Christian organizations in their ministries when\n      requested.</p>\n    </dir>\n    <b></b><p>Doug Patch, Coordinator</p>\n    <p>SUMMARY OF 1997</p>\n    <p>We learned a lot this year through the work of External Relations. God\n    affirmed the value of Xenos' contributions to the greater Christian community, but\n    simultaneously, we believe he pointed us toward more focus on developing our ministries\n    here at home. As a result, we have re-structured the administration of Xenos that includes\n    reducing External Relations to a department within the Evangelism division, and we have\n    eliminated the large out-of-town conferences we had been hosting. We continue to make new\n    friends in the Christian community nationally and distribute our books and tapes at a rate\n    that is difficult to keep up with!</p>\n    <p>We set an aggressive goal of doubling the 1996 sales of Xenos authored books and\n    audiotapes (other than <i>Death of Truth</i>), and we met our goal. Many people\n    contributed ideas and materials that helped achieve this goal. We thank the efficient work\n    of Heidi Ann Klingler and a key volunteer, Carolyn Voelker (in charge of inventory), in\n    keeping the order process flowing. Andy Ault has worked arduously on the database to\n    improve this process.</p>\n    <p>The goal of three out of town <i>Death of Truth </i>conferences, with attendance\n    averaging 200 registrants, was partially achieved. Denver had over 230 registrants and\n    Lincoln, Illinois over 100 registrants&#x97;plus an additional 400 students attended.\n    Although people are awakened to the dangers of postmodernism, we are uncertain that the\n    investment of money and time into these conferences is adequately offset by the fruit\n    born. Coupling that tension with the obvious increased fruit here on the home-front and\n    need to enhance our church's missions initiative, the elders think God is probably\n    pointing us toward heavier investment here in Columbus and less with other organizations.</p>\n    <p>We exceeded our goal of a 20% increase in attendance while providing logistical and\n    promotional support to Crossroads' <i>Summer Evangelism Institute</i>. Attendance grew by\n    25% with 742 registrants. The number of out-of-town attendees approximately doubled to\n    over 120. Heidi Ann Klingler, and key volunteers including Carolyn Voelker and Carla\n    Schoenleb (over 190 volunteers total) collaborated to provide smooth logistics. Thanks to\n    all contributors to the building fund for providing a superior environment for this\n    conference.</p>\n    <p>Our World Wide Web sites expanded to include a site for the high-school\n    group&#x97;written primarily by students. The number of people accessing the sites has\n    increased steadily. Last year in November our site was \"hit\" an average of 1,729\n    daily. This year the November daily average was more than double of that at 3,708! In\n    addition, we have state of the art shopping capabilities for the outside world with\n    encryption available for secure purchases. Web sales continue to grow, although the\n    majority of our materials are free. Churches and Christian organizations continue to be\n    amazed at the breadth and depth of the materials that we freely share. Jay Reilly, with\n    the help of volunteers, has managed and modified these sites regularly.</p>\n    <p>Our newest initiative provided a promotional plan, materials, and the leg-work behind\n    the Real Life program, administrated by Student Ministries. This program recruits college\n    students who are Christians, but not members of Xenos, to attend Ohio State or Columbus\n    State. Simultaneously, we train them in the key Christian ministries of evangelism and\n    discipleship. Essentially, we work with them in the same way we have worked with our own\n    students in Xenos for the past two and one-half decades. Kamie Dixon and Jay Reilly worked\n    with Tom Mack who provided the key elements of design of the brochure (all on a voluntary\n    basis). They also worked in collaboration with Horizons Video to produce the promotional\n    video. They, and Jeff Gabriel, have been traveling around the state through October and\n    November, meeting with Christian high school students and organizations to promote this\n    program. We contacted every Christian high school in Ohio by phone, and we visited about\n    18 of the most interested schools. Over 90 students have expressed interest in our\n    program, and we will personally follow up on them in the next couple of months. Most of\n    these students are just now starting to make college decisions. Let's pray that God shows\n    us whether he wants this program to move forward by bringing us the first students for the\n    fall of 1998. </p><dir>\n      <dir>\n        <b></b><p>Evangelism Division</p>\n      </dir>\n      <p>The Evangelism Division exists to facilitate an effective\n      witness for Christ in the Greater Columbus area by mobilizing church members to carry our\n      their roles in the Great Commission and by providing effective structures that will help\n      people to establish a personal relationship with Jesus Christ</p>\n    </dir>\n    <b></b><p>Doug Patch, Coordinator</p>\n    <p>1998 PRIMARY GOALS</p>\n    <p>We have always planned to transition from the time-intensive out-of-town\n    exposure to a more home-based sharing of our ministries. 1998 is the year that transition\n    takes hold. External Relations has been reduced from a division to a department\n    commensurate with the elimination of its out-of-town conference promotions and management.\n    Jay Reilly has been promoted to director of this department.</p>\n    <p>During 1998 we would like to grow to 2,000 total adult attendance at the three Sunday\n    Central Teachings. We have reached over 1,800 attendance several times since the Grand\n    Opening. With the evangelistic fervor our church (you!) is showing, this is very\n    attainable. Our evangelistic ministry teams should grow to about 276 total adult\n    attendance, up from the present 216. To accomplish these goals, the Fiscal Support Team\n    voted in a full-time Central Teaching director and a part time administrator of the\n    burgeoning Playgroup Network&#x97;one of our key pre-evangelistic ministries. With these\n    new hires, we will be able to spend more time properly following up the people God is\n    bringing, and continue to offer events and creative projects which will fuel the great\n    outreach our church is doing.</p>\n    <p>Two baptisms instead of one will greatly alleviate the crowded conditions at Riverby\n    Park and draw more attention to and motivation for evangelism. Set your calendars today\n    for June 12<sup>th</sup> and August 14<sup>th</sup>. </p>\n    <p>The Evangelism division will work cooperatively with the Pastoral division to enhance\n    the process of welcoming and helping new people get connected with home groups. We will\n    remain strong in our emphasis on raising up new leaders and planting new groups.</p>\n    <p>The External Relations department will embark on a heavy task of \"gardening\"\n    our web sites to ensure up-to-date information and a graphically appealing look. We have\n    shortened the newly named <i>Xenos Summer Institute</i> to four days in response to the\n    many requests for a more compact conference. We are hoping for a greatly increased\n    participation in this conference, both from outside churches as well as our own.</p>\n    <p>External Relations will continue their efforts in promoting the Real Life program,\n    sales and promotions of Xenos materials through the world wide web and our direct mail\n    catalog. We will also expand the tape series available to the public. </p><dir>\n      <b></b><p>Operations Division</p>\n      <p>The Xenos Operations Division provides administrative\n      support, communications, and facilities, helping focus the ministries conducted by our\n      church staff and members.</p>\n    </dir>\n    <b></b><p>Steve Bauer, Coordinator</p>\n    <p>SUMMARY OF 1997</p>\n    <p>1997 was primarily focused on the completion and occupation of our Main\n    Campus facility. It was great to have the Office &amp; Study Center as the \"nerve\n    center\" for planning and implementation of our building goals. Several individuals\n    within the Operations division, spent over half of each day on issues related to our\n    building projects. The year also saw the successful culmination of our sale of property to\n    The Home Depot, which brought in $1 million in cash, along with almost $1 million in\n    required roadway improvements. God was certainly at work enabling us to make some great\n    strides this year against what seemed to us to be insurmountable goals.</p>\n    <p>Operation&#x92;s Facilities department oversaw the challenges of managing our new\n    facilities and working to transition us out of the old \"warehouse.\" At the same\n    time, we worked daily with our contractor to complete our meeting and classroom space,\n    which opened August 31. This critical department ended the year split into two\n    departments&#x97;Facilities Usage, under John Circle, and Facilities Maintenance, with a\n    newly hired director, Dave Bucklew. The year also saw the start-up of several volunteer\n    functions&#x97;working on cleaning, landscaping and maintenance.</p>\n    <p>Our Technical Services department (Sound &amp; Light) implemented an extensive design\n    for new systems at the Main Campus facility. Mark Grover was charged with the consuming\n    tasks of designing sound and stage systems, and then installing those systems. Mark also\n    oversaw the very difficult task of keeping our old meeting spaces providing adequate\n    support during our transition. Some hurdles remain with the overall sound balancing and\n    acoustics of the main auditorium, but the pieces are in place to make our space a premier\n    stage venue.</p>\n    <p>Our offices became a place that facilitated many ministries with an increasing level of\n    productivity. Cathy Kaiser moved to full-time as our office manager, and oversaw the task\n    of providing a hospitable focal point for visitors and volunteers. We are poised to\n    provide even better support to the members of the church and our staff, with improvements\n    to equipment along with more standardized procedures and policies.</p>\n    <p>Media &amp; Graphics continued to provide excellent communication media within the\n    church, primarily through the \"Weekly Update\" and the \"Exchange.\"\n    Chris Lang developed our new Xenos brochure&#x97;a daunting task requiring the patience\n    and perseverance to work through many diverse opinions and options to develop a piece that\n    tries to capture reflects all (at least most) of what our church is.</p>\n    <p>1997 was the first full year in which the Xenos database was fully converted to a\n    long-term, maintainable hardware and software network platform. We rely heavily on the\n    reporting provided through our information systems. Our Information Services director,\n    Andy Ault, faced many challenges in making the tools we have work to their full potential,\n    and we leave the year on a very solid basis for the coming years.</p>\n    <p>The Finance and Accounting Department, headed by our controller, Alan Burkholder,\n    continued the job of maintaining our church&#x92;s financial resources and safe-guarding\n    our growing assets. The financing arrangements for our new facilities required extensive\n    attention. We had an excellent year of giving to both the general fund and our building\n    fund. As our ministries and staff continue to grow, we have ever increasing needs for the\n    professional management provided by Alan and his staff.</p>\n    <b></b><p>1998 PRIMARY GOALS</p>\n    <p>The coming year for the Operations Division will be the first one in 3 years\n    not consumed by our building related projects. Operations is responsible for providing a\n    productive working environment for our staff and volunteers. Our overarching goal will be,\n    simply, to <i>facilitate ministry within the church</i>. We will gauge our success in this\n    endeavor by the feedback we receive from staff and our members.</p>\n    <p>The new structure in the oversight of our facilities is designed to maintain the high\n    levels of service we need with the growth we are experiencing now and expected in the\n    future. We will now have one contact point for all users of all of our facilities, John\n    Circle. All maintenance, cleaning, set-up functions and management of our building service\n    contracts will be the responsibility of Dave Bucklew. This approach will simplify things\n    for all of our facility users. We will implement systems and policies to ensure that\n    facility requests are addressed efficiently and consistently. We will be praying for God\n    to bring forward servants who will work diligently on our maintenance, landscaping and\n    cleaning teams, so we can have fully accredited ministry teams working on these areas in\n    1998.</p>\n    <p>1998 will be a time of stabilizing and augmenting our installed Main Campus systems. We\n    want to provide enhanced sound, lighting and stage support. We will bring in some\n    specialized technical expertise early in the year to work with Mark Grover on plans to be\n    implemented during the year.</p>\n    <p>Our office staff will focus on the development of better procedures for providing\n    support to staff and volunteers. We will also hire an administrative assistant for the\n    Operations division who will support Cathy Kaiser.</p>\n    <p>Additional staffing in our Information Systems department will allow Andy Ault to\n    implement database reporting to support each of our division&#x92;s expanding needs. We\n    will also implement software systems to support operating goals for our facilities and\n    assets. Of course, we will also support the inevitable unforeseen projects that always\n    arise during the year.</p>\n        <p>Our Media &amp; Graphics department will focus on completing a Xenos \n          \"Welcome\" package in 1998. This package will allow us to customize \n          materials about our church for any audience interested in knowing more \n          about our ministries. We will also work hard this year to lay the groundwork \n          for translations of the book <i>Christianity: the Faith that Makes Sense \n          </i>into two different languages, for use in key missions fields. Chris \n          will also continue to oversee the installation of our new building signs, \n          early in the year. Finally, we will add new part-time staff to develop \n        videos for our Central Teachings.</p>\n    <p>Our Finance and Accounting department will be challenged to provide the same excellent\n    service as we expand ministry in 1998. More funding and activity will create opportunities\n    for Alan Burkholder and his staff to review and modify policies and procedures to ensure\n    they best fit our operating practices. At the same time, our management will require\n    enhanced and more timely financial reporting to run the church effectively, and we will\n    look to technology to help us find some answers in this area.</p>\n    <p>The senior elders should have more time this year to provide strategic planning to our\n    division coordinators, and we hope to provide better communication and implementation\n    support to the management team. We will also bring in a consultant to look at our human\n    resources practices and provide a plan for improving our oversight in this area. </p><dir>\n      <dir>\n        <b></b><p>Conclusion</p>\n      </dir>\n    </dir>\n    <p>The Fiscal Support Team retreat in December 1997 was an invigorating and exciting time\n    of realizing what God is doing through Xenos. This year has been exciting, fully meeting\n    and exceeding our expectations in almost every area. The coming year may be better yet! </p>\n    <p>Already, the elders and leaders of the church are planning for a further massive\n    expansion of <img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/97arpsite.gif\" width=\"495\"></p>\n    <p>our facilities, which may be completed as soon as five years from now if conditions are\n    right. </p>\n    <p>But before we can make such a move, we must double most ministries and satisfy\n    ourselves that the church is healthy, stable, and balanced. If completed, the next phase\n    of development would make the Xenos site into a regional center of Christian learning.\n    Whether this next step in our ministry takes 5 years or 10 is not important as far as the\n    elders are concerned. Naturally, we would prefer 5, but we think it much more important to\n    ascertain that Xenos remains faithful to the full vision for church life that has so\n    blessed us in the past. The fact that hundreds and even thousands of new people are\n    joining us for meetings is good, but are they buying into our vision of the church just as\n    much as those who have been here longer? We must be certain on this question.</p>\n    <p>Pray that God will continue to choose us to carry out his mission through Xenos.\n    Continue to contribute your own unique gifts. Continue to thank him for his faithfulness!</p>\n    <b></b>\n    <p><b>1997 Summary Financial Information</b> </p>\n    <p>1997 giving proved to be the highest ever, and exceeded budgeted collections by\n    over $198,000.

We should all thank God\nfrom our hearts for answering prayers we have been offering up for years. Our unified and\nfruitful church is maturing and reaching lost people in dozens of venues, gaining health\nand momentum as we go. Our church has been reorganized this year, with six divisions\ninstead of five, but since 1995 operated under the old structure, we will report our year\nin five divisions one last time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/ops.htm\">OPERATIONS DIVISION </a></p>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"374\">\n  <tr>\n    <td valign=\"MIDDLE\">Xenos' Operations Division facilitates and focuses the ministries\n    conducted by the other Xenos divisions by providing them with tools, information and\n    administrative support. In support of this service mission, Operations provides timely,\n    accurate financial and statistical data, enables effective inter-divisional communication,\n    ensures that clean, comfortable and properly equipped facilities are available (including\n    programming for new facilities), and provides professional administrative support.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>SUMMARY OF 1995</h4>\n\n<p>In May of 1995, Steve Bauer replaced Tad Hale as the Operations Division coordinator.\nIn October, Steve took on dual responsibilities by also assuming the position of church\nExecutive Administrator. These changes to our organization meant the division looked very\ndifferent at the end of 1995. Operations departments achieved all major goals for the\nyear. </p>\n\n<p>Our accounting area managed the funds which were provided in an outstanding year of\nstewardship in the church. We managed general fund collections and associated expenditures\nin order to provide positive cash flow throughout the year. The church fiscal controller,\nAlan Burkholder, and his professional staff, helped management direct resources\neffectively through timely internal reporting and analysis. Since we ended 1995 with\n$100,000 of \"black-ink,\" Fiscal Support Team members had the delightful task of\ndeciding how to spend this overage on additional Christ-centered ministry. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to general fund collections, the division supported a highly successful\nbuilding campaign. The success of obtaining pledges, collecting against pledges and\nshowing overall fiscal responsibility helped us secure financing for our first facility,\nand get well underway on its construction at year-end. John Circle has taken on the role\nof the church's \"point man\" in the field as we complete our office building, and\nprogress in our programming for our new meeting facility. At the same time, John maintains\na role in managing work at our existing rented facilities. </p>\n\n<p>Andy Ault, our systems manager, delivered tools to our staff and volunteers to help us\nbetter perform our work. A new data base system now supports the many needs for\ninformation across the church and its diverse ministries. This system foundation allows us\nto have one central source of data, which can be maintained at distributed locations,\neliminating the redundant sources of data about people and ministry we contended with in\nthe past. This system has already allowed us to improve efficiency of our staff, and\nreduce the time it takes to gather and disseminate information critical to the mission of\nthe church. </p>\n\n<p>Our work to support presentations and music at central teachings, retreats and other\nevents kept Mark Grover focused on improving our ability to respond and plan ahead. We\nmade many improvements to our sound, light and stage tools, with all activity subject to\nensuring it could be transferred to the new facilities, when complete. </p>\n\n<p>Cathy Kaiser joined the administration area as church Administrative Assistant, after\ncompleting the majority of her work with the <i>Commitment to the Future: A Time to Build</i>\ncampaign. Chris Lang's Media Concepts director role also moved over to the Operations\nDivision during our Fall reorganization. </p>\n\n<h4>1996 PRIMARY GOALS</h4>\n\n<p>1996 will see the continuation of intense activity focused on the completion of our new\nfacilities. The Operations Division will provide primary support for planning, design and\ncompletion of the buildings. In late spring, we will move our offices and resource center\ninto the newly-completed office complex. </p>\n\n<p>At the same time, we will continue to meet on-going goals related to facilitating\nministry in each of the other church divisions. Operations needs to help focus human and\nfinancial resources, minimize cumbersome administrative processes and improve the\naccessibility of information for our ministries. Primarily, we will continue providing\ntimely monthly financial statements, administering our enhanced Employee Benefits Plan,\nimproving our capabilities at existing facilities, providing information and tools for\nbetter management, and improving our communications and publications to serve the church's\nneeds. </p>\n\n<p>We will also seek better ways to use staff and volunteers focused on five areas: human\nresource management, office assistance, systems development and support, facilities and\ngrounds maintenance (e.g., landscaping), and communications. Ministry Teams will be\nanalyzed for these key operational areas in the hope that we can more effectively mobilize\nthe outstanding knowledge within our fellowship to meet the church's goals in these areas.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/evang.htm\">EVANGELISM DIVISION</a></h3>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"374\">\n  <tr>\n    <td valign=\"MIDDLE\">Xenos' Evangelism Division administrates an effective witness for\n    Christ in Greater Columbus, other cities in the United States, and to unreached people\n    groups throughout the world. This mission is accomplished by providing effective\n    structures that will help facilitate Xenos members in their attempts to help those in\n    Central Ohio establish a personal relationship with Christ, by mobilizing all Xenos\n    members to carry out their specific roles in the evangelistic task, and by administrating\n    Xenos extra-local evangelistic projects, including cross cultural mission work.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n<h4>Summary of 1995</h4>\n\n<p>Student outreach was again one of our major goals, and we met nearly all of the goals\nassociated with this important ministry. We saw student group attendance increase by\none-third. More importantly, dozens of students received Christ and forty of them joined\nstudy groups. The Junior High Blow-Out meeting increased attendance by one-half, and high\nschool groups expanded by 45%. The OSU campus group did not end the year with growth;\nhowever, three home churches were formed which have enhanced body-life and discipleship.\nWe are determined to see a vigorous ministry on campus. </p>\n\n<p>Adult central teaching attendance only grew by 20-30 people this year. We suspect that\ncrowding in our children's program affected our ability to grow in the adult meetings.\nThis trend may continue until we move into our facility. Implementing the \"Welcome\nReceptions\" helped incorporate dozens people into home fellowship groups, which was a\nmajor goal for 1995. </p>\n\n<p>\"Conversation &amp; Cuisine\" and \"Mom's Play Groups\" grew\nsubstantially in number during 1995. Our goal was to increase the number of these groups\nby 50%. The actual number of groups doubled this year! Now, hundreds of Christian workers\nare actively using these pre-evangelistic tools to reach their unchurched friends. Over\n500 guests attended \"Conversation &amp; Cuisine\" and \"Mom's Play\nGroups,\" and many have since accepted Christ and become involved in Xenos. Patty\nFlores gathered outreach data for \"Conversation &amp; Cuisine,\" which revealed\nthat so far over 100 of the 400 guests have also attended at least one Central Teaching\nthis year. </p>\n\n<p>World Ministries mobilized two missions teams in 1995. Jim and Beth Himsworth \n  and their children left for southern Brazil, where they will be equipping Brazilian \n  workers for a church-planting ministry. The Eastern Europe Team, was fully accredited \n  for church-planting work in Eastern regions of Europe<i><b> </b></i>.<i> </i>World \n  Ministries also began to establish and implement a long-term missions strategy, \n  including fund-raising strategies for Xenos missionaries. </p>\n\n<p>The Evangelism Division operated frugally, ending the year 5% under budgeted spending. </p>\n\n<h4>1996 Primary Goals</h4>\n\n<p>We will again prioritize outreach to students, and include an increased focus on\ndiscipleship. Xenos has formed the new Student Outreach Division to enhance our student\nministries. We hope to see student groups grow by 50% in 1996. This goal is attainable,\nbut it will require the recruitment of several more adult volunteer workers. We also plan\non implementing a junior high program at the adult central teachings. This should prove\nvery fruitful in reaching students of adult guests and newer families. The high school\ngroups will relocate to our new facility this spring, and we will decide whether to\ncombine our two high school groups or keep them separate. We hope to multiply ministry\nhouses which will help the transition of high school students to our college groups. We\nare also making efforts to rent a more suitable campus central teaching facility. </p>\n\n<p>Dave Merker, the new coordinator of this division, will prepare for an increased influx\nguests at our adult central teachings as we begin relocation to our new facilities in\nearly 1996. We plan on strongly promoting home group involvement, while strategically\nenhancing displays that will assist our guests and members. Dave will also initiate more\ncomprehensive oversight of our Central Teaching task teams. </p>\n\n<p>In our Adult Special Projects Department, we hope to form a ministry team focusing on\noutreach to parents of children between the ages of 5 and 10. We also want to offer a few\nevangelism workshops, including a fellowship-wide effort. \"Conversation &amp;\nCuisine\" leaders and facilitators will hold a retreat for planning and motivation for\nthe coming year. We will continue to pursue forming relationships with our unchurched\nfriends so they can learn about the love of Christ. </p>\n\n<p>By summer, we hope to have all of our extra-local churches (Cleveland, Dayton and\nCincinnati) formally independent from our Columbus base. Our director will consult with\ntwo experienced extra-local church planters and then write an extra-local church\nassociation policy that will detail strategies for planting new groups and supporting\nexisting groups. </p>\n\n<p>In our World Ministries Division, we hope to send the Eastern Europe Team to \n  the field by mid-year. We also hope to accredit another team for field work, \n  and personally visit an existing Xenos missions team. Finally, we'd like to \n  develop a training track for future missionaries. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>PASTORAL DIVISION</h3>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"374\">\n  <tr>\n    <td valign=\"MIDDLE\">Xenos' Pastoral Division assists Xenos members toward Christian\n    maturity by providing Christian community and spiritual care for them. This mission is\n    accomplished through offering home groups, ongoing development of deacons, various\n    ministry teams, and pastoral counseling.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>SUMMARY OF 1995</h4>\n\n<p>The Pastoral Division, led by Phil Franck, made some significant advancements in 1995.\nUnder Danny Walker's oversight of the home group department, home groups made a net gain\nof six groups over last year, adults home group attendance rose from 835 in 1994, to 1128\nin 1995. This growth was due in part to the successful reincorporation of over 280 Xenos\npeople, many of whom had previously belonged to home groups that ended for various\nreasons. The new \"Welcome Receptions\" contributed immensely to helping these\npeople find home group fellowship. </p>\n\n<p>We called on home group leaders to pursue discipleship relationships with some of their\ngroups' members, with the goal of raising up new Servant Team members. We also emphasized\nother themes of continuing education for leaders and informed them of new ways to enhance\nevangelism. We continued home group enhancement nights, which brought additional\nencouragement and training to leaders. Experienced Xenos leaders began home group\nvisitations, which helped the quality of home group oversight. </p>\n\n<p>Calumet Christian School is doing better than ever! Dave Glover did an excellent job\nmanaging the school, SAT scores were their highest in five years. We made significant\nplans for capital improvements, as well as numerous organizational and procedural\nimprovements. We also formed a new school board which relieved the elders of this\nresponsibility. God answered our prayers for enrollment to reach 300 students total and 40\nin middle school. Today we have 304 students and 41 in middle school!! There is good\nevidence of spiritual vitality in the students, and some of them are reaching friends for\nChrist. We applaud and thank the many CCS (Calumet Christian School) parents who\nvolunteered on various school projects--they made a measurably positive difference in the\nschool's ministry. </p>\n\n<p>In OASIS, we were finally able to move into Building 9 this fall. Even though we expect\nto reach capacity there soon, the extra space enabled the children's program to grow.\nUnder Kathy Steinman's able leadership, the teacher recruitment plan was successful, and\nwe generated our own curriculum. </p>\n\n<p>In the counseling department, Katey Downs offered the \"Marriage Readiness\"\ncourse and \"Resolving Divorce\" class. Her \"Biblical Framework for Human\nEmotions\" will be offered in early 1996. The counseling department collections are at\n100%, and the department ran smoothly even though the number of weekly clients was at 20%\nover expectations. Katey is known for her solid spiritual counsel for people in need.. </p>\n\n<h4>1996 Primary Goals</h4>\n\n<p>In addition to the central emphasis on evangelism, discipleship, teaching and\nbody-life, home groups will focus on leadership development. We anticipate significant\nhome group growth after we move into the new facilities. </p>\n\n<p>Calumet Christian school is now in the Student Outreach division. It will focus on\nbuilding spiritual maturity into the students. The school's administration will continue\nto closely evaluate the state's curriculum as an ongoing commitment to resist postmodern\nelements in education. The CCS school board will concentrate on increasing enrollment,\nparticularly in the middle school grades. The board hopes many parents--in and outside of\nXenos--will learn of our outstanding program and decide to educate their children at CCS. </p>\n\n<p>For the Counseling department, Katey Downs will focus on equipping home group leaders\nand workers to provide solid counseling for many of the people in their groups. She wants\nto debunk the notion that effective biblical counseling can only be done by professionals\nin most cases. </p>\n\n<p>OASIS, which is now in the Student Outreach division, will seek additional writers and\neditors to continue developing our own curriculum. OASIS will also focus on getting ready\nfor the move to new facilities. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/equip.htm\">EQUIPPING DIVISION</a></h3>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"374\">\n  <tr>\n    <td valign=\"MIDDLE\">The Xenos Equipping Division provides educational resources for\n    Christians to understand and apply biblical truth to their lives, and to prepare for\n    fruitful ministry.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>SUMMARY OF 1995</h4>\n\n<p>1995 has been an exciting year for the Equipping Division. We birthed the Crossroads\nProject, our equipping ministry to the broader evangelical church. The Crossroads Project\nis a group of Christian scholars, researchers and leaders dedicated to preparing God's\npeople for effective ministry to contemporary culture. This purpose is accomplished by\napplying biblical and critical analysis to current cultural thought and by providing\npractical tools to reach the lost and strengthen the church. </p>\n\n<p>We completed important projects, such as <i>The Death of Truth</i>, a multi-authored\nbook by members of the Crossroads team, that explains postmodernism and its effect on the\nculture. We held two \"Postmodern Challenge\" conferences, at Ohio State and\nEastern Michigan University. The feedback for both the book and the conference has been\nextremely positive. </p>\n\n<p>Enrollment in adult education significantly surpassed last year's projections. This is\nan indication that our church affirms that learning is essential to spiritual growth and\neffective ministry. We offered an average of seven courses each quarter--a broader\ncurriculum than we have ever had. Most significantly, over 90 students completed the\nfour-unit Christian Principles class, which is the core curriculum for membership on the\nServant Team. </p>\n\n<p>The Study Center continued to add to its excellent collection and memberships remained\nstable. The general response to moving the Study Center has been positive and may provide\nan opportunity for significantly increased use next year. </p>\n\n<h4>1996 Primary Goals</h4>\n\n<p>The Crossroads Project will hold at least three \"Postmodern Challenge\"\nconferences in 1996: Kent State University, University of Michigan, and Trinity\nEvangelical Divinity School. We will also be promoting <i>The Death of Truth </i>and the\nCrossroads Project Summer Apologetics Institute, to be held July 8-19 in our new facility.\n</p>\n\n<p>The adult education program will continue to offer a broad and excellent range of\nclasses. Our goal is to meet the 1995 enrollment level of 1400. We will be exploring some\nnew options to make our courses more accessible to the church, such as offering a limited\nnumber of weekend and day time classes. </p>\n\n<p>The Study Center will continue to add to its excellent collection of periodicals, books\nand tapes. Perhaps most significantly, we will add three powerful new computers, loaded\nwith software that will connect patrons with the internet and state of the art programs\nfor biblical and theological research. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>SERVICE DIVISION</h3>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"374\">\n  <tr>\n    <td valign=\"MIDDLE\">Xenos' Service Division provides practical service to the Xenos,\n    non-Christian and broader Christian communities. This mission is accomplished by creating\n    and administering in-house service ministries, carrying out Xenos' strategy for community\n    development, and building working relationships with other organizations, especially\n    churches.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>SUMMARY OF 1995</h4>\n\n<p>From various points of view, this was our busiest year yet. As The Crossroads Project\nand its conference developed, we logged many hours of fruitful labor. We provided\nlogistical support at Eastern Michigan and The Ohio State Universities. With the help of\nmany staff members and volunteers, we began construction of our world-wide web site. </p>\n\n<p>We made some changes in key staff positions in 1995. Jay Reilly resigned as Internal\nService Director, and Tad Hale took his place. Lou Spinks went to full-time with Urban\nConcern. We re-hired Jay Reilly as Marketing Manager for the new External Relations\nDivision. Heidi Ann Klingler returned to work at Xenos as a secretary. Sherri Fojas took\non a new role as Administrative Assistant for the External Relations Division. </p>\n\n<p>We met most of our primary goals for 1995. The Servant Team grew substantially in size\nand quality, and we had a very successful Servant Team retreat at the Cherry Valley Lodge\nin Newark, Ohio. We also ended the year under budget. </p>\n\n<p>In Community Development we opened the Harambee Center. We also began renovation on a\nproperty which will provide additional office space for Urban Concern and housing for a\nfamily from South Linden. Lou Spinks and Jim Swearingen were busy developing our strategy\nfor a low-income project. </p>\n\n<p>As a part of a reorganizational strategy implemented last fall, we disassembled the\nService Division and formed a new division from one of our previous departments --\nExternal Relations. This division provides administration, logistical support and\npromotion for Xenos projects reaching out to other churches and Christian organizations. </p>\n\n<p>Dave Merker was named coordinator of External Relations, and all other service\nministries were relocated to other divisions. In late December, we realized that it made\nmore sense to have Dave coordinate the Evangelism/Missions Division. Doug Patch has now\nbecome the coordinator of External Relations. This move should provide us with focus and\nthe ability to serve in areas for which everyone is well suited. </p>\n\n<h4>1996 Primary Goals</h4>\n\n<p>External Relations has four primary objectives for the coming year. First of all, we\nwant to continue to establish national name recognition for certain Xenos ministries. This\nwill happen, in part, as we establish and build relationships with important Christian\nleaders throughout the country. We also plan to form a \"speakers bureau\" for\nCrossroads Project contributors and set up six speaking engagements for them. We plan to\nadd three exciting new Crossroads programs this year: \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li>We will participate in the nationwide Teaching Church Network. TCN links proven fruitful\n    churches with other churches who want to improve their effectiveness. Xenos will be a\n    teaching church, and plans to mentor four developing churches over a two-year period. </li>\n  <li>We will initiate a student mentoring program this fall. This program provides college\n    students with the opportunity to live in a ministry house, take Xenos courses, get\n    ministry experience, and be mentored by an experienced Christian worker. </li>\n  <li>We will hold an Apologetics Summer Institute in July. This course will field a variety\n    of Xenos speakers, and cover a number of apologetical issues relevant to current\n    ideological trends. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Secondly, we want to complete or have in progress eight \"Postmodern\nChallenge\" conferences. We already have conferences planned for Kent State University\nin February, the University of Michigan in March, and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School\nin October. Our church in Cincinnati is working to set up a conference there sometime this\nyear. </p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, we want to develop and promote our world-wide web sites. Already we have\nhundreds of pages on our sites and there are plans to add many more. Hundreds of people\nfrom all over the world have visited our site and the feedback we're getting is very\nencouraging. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, we want to try to market 4000 copies of <i>The Death of Truth</i>. This\nimportant new work is scheduled for release the second week of January. Plan to attend the\nsigning party January 17! The book will be available at our conferences and through our\nweb site. We are already arranging radio interviews for some of its authors. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1995-1996 Summary Financial Information</h3>\n\n<p>1995 giving proved to be the highest ever, and exceeded budgeted collections by over\n$72,000. In addition, division coordinators met their goals while spending under their\nbudgets by over $82,000. The December Fiscal Support Team retreat targeted an overall 1996\nbudget of just over $1.8 million. The following is a summary of financial information for\n1995 and 1996. </p>\n\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"640\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"25%\" valign=\"MIDDLE\"><b>1995 </b>Based

out of sight from\nmost members, we broke several barriers and opened new ministry that contains explosive\npotential for the coming years. \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li>Youth outreach has been the number one goal of our church for several years, \n    but no year has been as fruitful in this area as 1995. High school outreach \n    has resulted in a impressive 45% growth in our number of high schoolers, a \n    figure that is more remarkable when you consider that each year another class \n    graduates into the college ranks. The vast majority of this growth has been \n    convert growth from non-Xenos high schoolers. Junior high has also posted \n    heavy growth at just over 50% over the previous year. College outreach remains \n    at a lower level of growth. Pray for college outreach during 1996--including \n    our attempts to secure a more suitable site for the campus meeting. </li>\n  <li>We completed the public phase of our funding drive for new facilities. Our \n    level of commitment is, according to verbal assurances from at least one bank, \n    sufficient to secure loans for both building A and B. This means ground will \n    be broken for our main building as soon as we complete a small land acquisition \n    with the city, and collect at least $750,000 in cash. (We only need about \n    $180,000 more to reach this goal). This is the end of a very painful but fruitful \n    road for our church. Look for dirt to fly this spring! </li>\n  <li>We attained approval for building A and began construction. This building \n    is going to revolutionize the study center, our offices, and most importantly, \n    our student outreach. We should feel excited about what God is going to accomplish \n    through this long-awaited ministry tool. Also, morale in the church will improve \n    as we finally see action instead of words about our facility. </li>\n  <li>We advanced more than 10% in giving to the general fund over the previous \n    year, thereby funding important refinements and expansion to our operation. \n    After two years of very low growth in budget, (mainly because of a church \n    division) we are again on the move. Our goal of over 12% growth in 1996 is \n    attainable and will result in more exciting results in ministry. </li>\n  <li>The Crossroads Project has moved out of the research and planning phase \n    after operating two conferences and completing our book, <i>The Death of Truth</i>. \n    We are now ready to take our message in the area of apologetics to the larger \n    Christian community, with three or more conferences planned for 1996. Our \n    first Summer Apologetics Institute is also going forward in 1996, and we even \n    have a building in which to hold it. </li>\n  <li>We accredited the Eastern Europe team with three couples to open ministry \n    in the former Soviet Union. This is the first full-sized team we have been \n    able to accredit since the SE Asia Team four years ago. We hope to see an \n    acceleration in missions sending now that our buildings are financed. Our \n    12.4% growth in budget goal is part of this acceleration. </li>\n  <li>Huge Xenos ministries, like Urban Concern, OASIS, and Calumet Christian \n    School are carrying out their ministries in an orderly and responsible way, \n    bearing fruit and increasing in the work of God. No longer do we live in fear \n    that we could be swamped or endangered by instability in such large-scale \n    ministries. Lending institutions' willingness to loan Xenos money is a reflection \n    of the stability and maturity of these ministries, and their spiritual fruit \n    is known and treasured inside and outside Xenos. </li>\n  <li>Xenos administration underwent a reorganization that should enhance our \n    efficiency and ability to accommodate more people and projects. A new Executive \n    Administrator role was given to Steve Bauer, and Doug Patch has been named \n    as a new Division Coordinator. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Taken together, these major accomplishments along with scores of smaller but important\nattainments constitute the turning of a new page for Xenos. It's time to rev the engines\nand mobilize our church as several years of investment come to fruition. If our buildings\nare completed as expected, we will be experiencing substantial new growth and new\nresponsibilities during 1997. The growth goal adopted by the Fiscal Support Team is a\ncrucial part of our overall plan for expansion. Also, the time to build the needed\nleadership, training, and nurturing capabilities needed to accommodate this growth is not\nin 1997 but today! Join us in thanking God for what he has allowed us to do so far, and\nseeking his empowering to do even more in the near future.</p>\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Xenos Christian Fellowship 1995 Annual Report","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/aboutxenos/reports/1995.htm"}

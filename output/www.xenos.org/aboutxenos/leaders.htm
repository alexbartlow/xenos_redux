For a period  of at least three months' nomination; the candidate, existing elders and deacons  provide feedback on the candidate's fit for office. At a scheduled meeting of the Xenos Servant  Team, all deacons in attendance vote on the inclusion of the new candidate as  an elder for an established term.        </p>\n        <h3><strong><a name=\"ElderCandidates\" id=\"ElectingNewElders2\"></a>Current Elder Candidate, <em>None</em></strong></h3>\n        \n        <div class=\"style1\">\n          <div><span class=\"style5\"><a name=\"Considerations\" id=\"Considerations\"></a><strong>Considerations  for Candidacy as Xenos Church Elders</strong></span></div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Not  all factors relating to readiness for each elder candidate are public  information. The following criteria should address most questions regarding the  suitability of key leaders in the church for eldership. <br>\n          <strong><br>\n          First</strong>, no current or emerging sphere leader fails to be  nominated because of questionable character issues or lack of maturity. They  are all fully qualified from that standpoint, since they already meet the biblical  character prerequisites for serving in that role. (See Titus 1:5-9 and 1  Timothy 3:1-7.) These character requirements also apply to our division coordinators  &#x2013; but they are precluded from serving as elders due to conflicts-of-interest, regarding  budget allocation and prioritization of resources performed by elders that  would directly affect their divisions.&#xA0; <strong> </strong><br>\n          <strong><br>\n        Second</strong>, to be nominated as an elder, several factors need  to converge at the same time. In addition to the essential biblical character  requirements:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li> The eldership of Xenos consists of individuals on staff, and also not on church staff. We will continue to seek the best candidates for the role of elder. When staff are considered for eldership, they will come from the pool of sphere leadership already serving in critical church roles. </li>\n          <li>The candidate must have been leading a Central  Teaching &#x201C;sphere&#x201D; for at least one year and their current sphere must be  flourishing. </li>\n          <li>The candidate must be comfortable in their  leadership role and have the intention of continuing as a sphere leader for the  foreseeable future. </li>\n          <li>The candidate must yield to open dialogue  between sphere leaders and the elders who will make the call about these  &#x201C;readiness&#x201D; issues. Candidates often need to wait because they are either:\n            <ol>\n              <li>too  new in the role;</li>\n              <li>not  leading fully developed spheres;</li>\n              <li>not  yet comfortable in the role;</li>\n              <li>lead  a sphere that might not be flourishing;</li>\n              <li>actively  considering a possible calling to different work. </li>\n            </ol>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n        <p><strong>Third, </strong>in all cases, we carefully deliberate about  candidates so the church can rest assured that everyone has been considered  carefully. Any current leaders could make good elders except for one or more of  these factors. Of course, it would be improper to disclose the details of these  deliberations publicly. We appreciate the trust the church extends to the  current elders in making these complicated judgment calls.<br>\n          <br>\n          <strong>Fourth, </strong>in addition to these objective factors, some sphere  leaders may (in the future) have schedule, geographical, health, or family issues  that might lead them (and the elders) to feel that this is not the time for  adding another duty to their lives. Since eldership is not a paid position and  requires additional hours of volunteer work, this may not be right or best for  everyone's situation. We do not pay elders for elder-related work because they  serve as trustees of our corporation. Under Ohio  law, an elder would be personally liable for any lawsuit against Xenos if they  were paid. (We do pay some elders for other duties they perform for the church,  but not for their work as elders.)<br>\n          <br>\n          The  motivation for having such extensive criteria is the well-being of the leaders  involved as well as the church. It is upsetting to be elected as an elder by  the church and then have to step down. Even when the reasons for stepping down  are perfectly legitimate, people don't like this experience and wonder what  people are thinking. It also takes time to become familiar with all of the  issues elders manage and eldership is not the kind of role that is performed  well on a short-term basis. We try to avoid asking anyone to become an elder  unless we are fairly certain they will be able to serve for some time.<br>\n        This  leads us to be conservative and as sure as possible before nominating someone  to eldership. We would rather wait if we are in any doubt about the timing of  the nomination. We will almost certainly nominate other elders in the near  future &#x2013; and for each nomination we engage in careful deliberation and prayer  trying to sense God's will for the leadership of our church. &#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n        \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      </div> \n     \n    </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/portraits/jeffgordon.jpg","title":"Our Leaders","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/aboutxenos/leaders.htm"}

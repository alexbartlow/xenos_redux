There is no official membership \n        at Xenos. However, we consider a number of biblical doctrines to be central \n        to our faith and vital to the integrity of all aspects of our ministry. \n        We affirm significant historic creeds of the church, such as the Apostles \n        Creed and the Nicene Creed. </p>\n      <h3>The Bible </h3>\n      <p>The Bible is the inspired word of God. The 66 books which constitute \n        the Bible are entirely reliable and truthful, and the Bible stands as \n        the central authority over our lives, our faith and the direction of our \n        church. </p>\n      <p>We are committed to standard formulations of biblical inspiration such\n         as the \"Chicago Statement on Biblical <a href=\"http://www.reformed.org/documents/index.html?mainframe=http://www.reformed.org/documents/icbi.html\" target=\"_blank\">Inerrancy</a>, and Hermeneutics.\" (2\n          Timothy 3:16; Matthew 5:18) </p>\n      <h3>The Trinity </h3>\n      <p>Three persons eternally share the Divine Nature. The Bible refers to \n        these persons as the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. God is both \n        self-existent and personal. (John 14:10, 26; 15:26) </p>\n      <h3>Jesus Christ</h3>\n      <p>Jesus Christ, the Son, is fully God and fully human. He lived a sinless \n        life, died for the sins of humankind, was resurrected bodily on the third \n        day, ascended into heaven and is coming again as King and Judge. </p>\n      <p>Jesus Christ is the only provision that God has given for people to be \n        reconciled to Him. Jesus' life on earth also serves as the model for the \n        Christian life. (John 14:6; Acts 4:12) </p>\n      <h3>Holy Spirit </h3>\n      <p>The Holy Spirit is God. He indwells us at the moment we place our faith \n        in Christ. He empowers us to live an effective Christian life by affirming \n        our salvation, encouraging us and giving us the strength to live a life \n        that is pleasing to God and personally fulfilling. The Holy Spirit also \n        endows each believer with a unique spiritual ability to serve the church \n        and the world. (John 14:16; Ephesians 1:19-20; 1 Corinthians 12) </p>\n      <h3>Salvation </h3>\n      <p>Salvation is reconciliation with God through the atoning work of Jesus \n        Christ. God offers us salvation by His grace alone and we receive it as \n        a gift through personal faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ. This \n        right standing before God must be received and cannot be earned. God freely \n        offers salvation to all people, and our salvation is secure. (Ephesians \n        2:8,9; Romans 8:38,39; Ephesians 1:13; 2:4)</p>\n      <h3>Humanity </h3>\n      <p>Human beings are created in the image of God. As such, we are unique \n        among all of God's creation. Through the abuse of our God-given free will, \n        we have turned against God and this has resulted in spiritual death for \n        all humankind. Humanity lives in a state of alienation and profound need \n        which can only be satisfied by reconciliation with God through Christ. \n        Without this reconciliation, all people stand under God's righteous judgment. \n      </p>\n      <p>Humanity, although fallen, maintains the image of God and is, therefore, \n        still dignified and unique. God continues to love us and reach out to \n        us, even though we are hostile to Him. Believers in Jesus Christ receive \n        a new nature that becomes the foundation for a process of transformation. \n        (John 3:16; 2 Corinthians 5:17) </p>\n      <h3>The Church </h3>\n      <p>The church is composed of all those throughout history who place saving \n        faith in Jesus Christ. The church is not an institution, but a people. \n        God wants all Christians to live out their spiritual lives in a corporate \n        context. This context of Christian love relationships is a crucial feature \n        of our witness for Christ as it reflects God's character to the world. \n      </p>\n      <p>The church is God's chosen instrument through which the message of salvation \n        is spread to all people. This mission is the central purpose for the church. \n        We are to carry the good news locally and worldwide and demonstrate the \n        gospel by relevant social action. (John 13:34, 35; 1 Corinthians 12:12-26; \n        Matthew 28:19) </p>\n      <h3>Satan </h3>\n      <p>Satan is the personal, spiritual adversary of God and God's followers. \n        Satan actively opposes the work of the church and the spiritual vitality \n        of Christians. We therefore take seriously, but in a balanced way, the \n        reality of personal, spiritual opposition. Satan is doomed to final defeat \n        and judgment when Christ returns. (Ephesians 6:12; Revelation 20) </p>\n      <h3>Second Coming </h3>\n      <p>This age will conclude with the personal, bodily return of Christ. At \n        that time, He will complete God's plan to reestablish His just and righteous \n        rule over all humanity. (Matthew 24:29-31; Revelation 20) </p>\n      <h3>The Afterlife </h3>\n      <p>At the final judgment, God will assign all people their eternal destinies-either \n        life or judgment. Those who have responded to Jesus Christ with saving \n        faith will receive the eternal life they have already been promised (John \n        5:24), while others will live under eternal judgment.</p>\n      <p>Therefore, because eternal issues are at stake, there is an urgency to \n        communicate the gospel. (Matthew 25:46; 2 Thessalonians 1:5-10)</p>\n      \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      </div> \n     \n    </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Xenos Statement of Faith","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/aboutxenos/ourfaith.htm"}

We think it&#x92;s the way people \n        get connected in a large church, similar to what we read about in the \n      early New Testament churches described in the book of Acts.</p>\n      <p>We&#x92;ll look at some of the roles of our home group leaders. This \n        article is abstracted from <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/aboutxenos/strange.htm\">information</a> \n        published by Lead Pastor Dennis McCallum.</p>\n      <h3>home group leaders handle all weddings, visitations and funerals</h3>\n      <p>In most churches, the staff handles functions such as these. In order \n        to marry members, home church leaders have to be ordained by the church. \n        This is something most churches are reluctant to do, since they don&#x92;t \n        want to proliferate ordained pastors who may not be well qualified. This, \n        of course, leads to the conclusion mentioned earlier: that we must hold \n        higher qualifications for our home church leaders.</p>\n      <table width=\"220\">\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"150\" height=\"2\"> \n            <h2>our approach to ministry assumes qualified leaders constantly \n              are rising up in our midst</h2>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n      <p>At Xenos, we not only allow home church leaders to carry out these functions \n        with their members, we require it. If a couple approached one of our lead \n        pastors and asked to be married, we would point out that they need to \n        ask their home church leaders to marry them. In a church where scores \n        of marriages may occur every year, our top leaders would be unable to \n        do much besides marry people every weekend if not for this policy. </p>\n      <p>Visiting the sick would require even more hours for the pastoral staff. \n        But at Xenos, sick people are visited and counseled by people in their \n        home groups. </p>\n      <p>When visiting pastors ask how we find time to disciple new leaders, write, \n        study, travel and teach classes, we point out that half the hours normal \n        \n        pastors would spend in basic pastoral functions are covered by our home \n        group leaders. This enables leaders to focus more time on discipling and \n        equipping. Our elders consider this oddity one really important feature \n        of Xenos, opening the door to lay ministry in a number of ways.</p>\n      <h3>home group leaders prepare their own Bible teachings</h3>\n      <p>Most churches we have studied provide a curriculum or lesson plan for \n        their home groups. These may be based on the sermon that week, or may \n        be nationally published small group curriculum like Serendipity or Touch. \n        We have looked at these options and experimented with some, but in the \n        end prefer not to use any.</p>\n      <p>Our leaders are equipped to develop their own lessons, mainly based on \n        expository study of the Bible. By far the majority of our groups are engaged \n        in expository Bible study of a New or Old Testament book at any one time. \n        In addition, groups occasionally do topical series on subjects of interest, \n        like marriage, finance, social ethics or theological topics. Our Study \n        Center provides all the materials leaders need to do personal research, \n        and groups also leave copies of series they have developed at the Center \n        for other groups to use. </p>\n      <table width=\"200\">\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"150\" height=\"2\"> \n            <h2>our leaders are equipped to develop their own lessons, mainly \n              based on expository Bible study </h2>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n      <p>In recent years, our leaders have also benefited greatly from our extensive \n        Web site. We find that leaders who base their groups on prepared curriculum \n        lose interest in teaching. The curriculum is often oversimplified and \n        seems to do too much for the teacher. Teaching people the ways of God \n        becomes something anyone can do and loses its challenge. People who are \n        doing sophisticated work in their careers may come to lead their Bible \n        study group and find themselves doing childishly simple work. No wonder \n        they lose interest!</p>\n      <h3>home group leaders get others involved in discipleship</h3>\n      <p>Xenos is an underground indigenous church planting movement. Our approach \n        to ministry assumes qualified leaders constantly are rising up in our \n        midst. We have to \"raise up\" more leaders every year just to keep up. When you consider how high our standards \n        are for leadership, you realize this isn&#x92;t an easy task. </p>\n      <p>But we continue to succeed because we don&#x92;t depend on the staff \n        to accomplish our leadership development. Instead, every mature Christian \n        in the church sees it as his or her job to help raise up new leaders. \n        Today, nearly 1,000 adults and students at Xenos have someone they are \n        discipling in private meetings (and many have several). This is in addition \n        to our home churches, cell groups and classes. </p>\n      <p>We find that these one-on-one times are good for building friendships, \n        and that many issues of application and personal character development \n        can only come out in these meetings. Also, nothing is better than a one-on-one \n        meeting for coaching in ministry development. </p>\n      <p>We are careful to avoid any definition of discipleship that implies the \n        discipler has control over the disciple, like in the so-called &#x93;Shepherding \n        Movement.&#x94; We teach our people that discipling is a facilitating \n        and helping role, not a controlling role. We are optimistic today that \n        leaders will be ready when needed tomorrow, because so many of \n        our people are actively engaged in personal discipleship.</p>\n      \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      </div> \n     \n    </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"What Are the Roles of Leaders in Xenos?","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/aboutxenos/faq/leadroles.htm"}

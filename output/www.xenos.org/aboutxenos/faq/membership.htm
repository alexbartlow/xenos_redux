The spiritual definition of &#x91;the church&#x92; \n          includes all true believers, and they are part of the body of Christ \n          whether they attend meetings or not. In that sense, we feel it would \n          be impossible for humans to accurately know who is a member and who \n          is not. </p>\n        <p>Furthermore, we believe efforts to establish membership can result \n          in an institutional definition of the church rather than an organic \n          or spiritual definition. Some that we define as members would be truly \n          non-members, while others who we deny are members would in fact be members. \n        </p>\n        <p>We see this distinctive as a good thing, but at the same time, a minor \n          thing. We don&#x92;t feel strongly critical of churches that have formal \n          memberships, and in fact, it would be difficult to say how much actual \n          impact this feature has had on Xenos&#x92; development. Our leadership \n          just feels that refusing to define membership contributes to a proper \n          view of the spiritual nature of the church&#x97;we let God keep our \n          membership rolls for us.&#x94;</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p>Instead, we do place a big emphasis in Xenos on joining a home group \n        because we believe it&#x92;s the solution for how people can get connected \n        in a large church. This is consistent with what we read about in the early \n        New Testament churches described in the book of Acts and the apostles&#x92; \n        letters. In our recurring 'All About Xenos' Reception, we highlight the \n        role home groups play in our church and why they&#x92;re such a terrific \n        first step for getting more involved. </p>\n      <table>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"150\"> <h2>Our home groups provide the heart of Christian \n              community.</h2></td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n      <p>Our home groups provide the heart of Christian community for learning \n        about God while developing close friendships. Baptisms, communion, weddings \n        and funerals are all carried out within this context. It&#x92;s only natural \n        that serving together with others in your home group is another great \n        way to grow spiritually while meeting the needs of others. It&#x92;s also \n        a great way to get a bigger picture of how God is working across the entire \n        church. Interestingly, the word &#x91;to minister&#x92; is translated \n        from the identical root word as &#x91;to serve.&#x92;</p>\n      <h3>why not volunteer?</h3>\n      <p>August is our annual sign-up month for the nearly 300 hundred volunteer \n        positions that support our Central Teachings for adults, and the related \n        ministries for children and students. Why not sign up to volunteer in \n        one of the roles listed below with someone in your home group? </p>\n      <h3>Children's Program (<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/oasis/index.htm\">Oasis</a>: \n        Infant-5th grade)</h3>\n      <p>Our staff strives to always  remember what it was like coming to Xenos for the \n        first time with our own small children. Many of us admit we initially shared a deep distrust for &#x91;church&#x92; including \n        many questions about the Bible. Then it became clear that God was at work mightily through the hearts \n        of the volunteers who nurtured our children. This in turn freed us up to soak in teaching \n        after teaching about God&#x92;s grace. What a great gift the progam is for the whole family. We see many other benefits to volunteering in this \n        ministry:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>It&#x92;s a practical way for people of all ages (especially new and \n          prospective parents) to get valuable experience interacting with children. \n          What better way for a parent to lead your child&#x92;s spiritual growth \n          than to participate as his or her teacher?</li>\n        <li>Through preparing studies for class, many of the newer Christians \n          in our group have accelerated their understanding of the Bible.</li>\n        <li>Others have developed teaching abilities that now serve our home church. \n        </li>\n        <li>Home churches grow (qualitatively and quantitatively) through the natural friendships made by \n          Oasis volunteers with parents who are newcomers to Xenos.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/jrhigh\">Junior High</a> (Blowout, \n        JAM, cell groups)</h3>\n      <p> Parents have a lead role in their children's spiritual \n        development. Xenos provides wonderful opportunities to stay connected \n        with our kids during the incredibly turbulent teen transition years. </p>\n      <p>Always an important ethic throughout biblical history and in Xenos, leading \n        the next generation by getting involved with your student&#x92;s spiritual \n        growth is deeply rewarding on many levels:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>It fosters trust, communication and understanding. </li>\n        <li>We develop better perspective, observe first-hand \n          a variety of social settings, and gain wisdom that helps make us more \n          patient and more effective. </li>\n        <li>Involevement also can help make us far better teachers and discussion leaders \n          in all settings, including in our adulthome groups.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>Besides helping to lead a cell group, there are other volunteer roles \n        at the weekend junior high meetings  Sunday mornings and evenings at our Main Campus venue, and Sunday morning student meetings at our 4th Street campus.</p>\n      <h3><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/ct/ct.htm\">Central Teaching</a> (CT)</h3>\n      <p>One of the biggest reasons we have such a consistent, welcoming atmosphere \n        at our Central Teachings is the friendly faces and warm smiles of the \n        volunteers who make our weekend meetings possible. Why not consider serving \n        on one of the task teams listed below? Positions renew annually every \n        June. Some positions require additional qualifications, but most juist need someone to step up and serve. </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Book Store</li>\n        <li>Financial Stewards</li>\n        <li>Greeter/Microphone</li>\n        <li>Grill</li>\n        <li>Missions Counter</li>\n        <li>Parking</li>\n        <li>Snack Bar</li>\n        <li>Audio/Visual Services</li>\n        <li>Welcome Centers</li>\n        <li>Hospitality</li>\n        <li>Facilities Hospitality <br>\n          (bathrooms/sprucing up).</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>Get specific <a href=\"mailto:eagled@xenos.org?subject=CT%20Task%20Teams\">CT \n        task team</a> information. </p>\n      \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      </div> \n     \n    </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/aboutxenos/graphics/about-header.jpg","title":"how can I get more involved?","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/aboutxenos/faq/membership.htm"}

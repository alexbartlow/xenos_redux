But we also believe that \n        a large meeting can uniquely accomplish certain elements of the Christian \n        life that we see pictured in the New Testament.</p>\n      <p>For instance, the early churches met in houses but also came together \n        in large meetings to hear the teachings of the apostles. Strong, culturally \n        relevant Bible teachings are the focal point of these larger meetings \n        we call Central Teachings (CTs). CTs provide a setting in which a couple \n        thousand adults hear God&#x92;s word taught through \n        highly gifted and trained teachers.  Dozens of home groups come together, \n        often bringing friends and family who want to have their questions answered \n        about Christianity.</p>\n      <h3>What do we do at Central Teachings?</h3>\n      <p>Our facility helps to set an informal, non-traditional atmosphere in \n        which Christians and non-Christians alike can relax. People are welcome \n        to take coffee, pop and snacks into the auditorium, while they hear what \n        God might want to say to them through his word. <br>\n        CTs start with prayer and music, followed by an expository Bible teaching \n        that lasts about 40 to 50 minutes. (Check out our extensive <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/teachings/index.htm\">teaching \n        outlines</a>.)</p>\n      <p>After the teaching, people can ask questions using microphones, or wait \n        until the meeting concludes to privately talk with the teacher or one \n        of the teaching team members. We close the meeting with prayer.<br>\n        We also provide digital recordings and RealMedia presentations from these meetings \n        at our Study Center, in our Bookstore and on the <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/teachings/index.htm\">web</a>. \n      </p>\n      <p>Our meetings are not &#x93;worship services,&#x94; as you might typically \n        think of. Xenos takes a somewhat unusual but biblical view of what worship \n        is in the New Testament. Our Web site explains more about our <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/aboutxenos/strange.htm\">view \n        of biblical worship</a>. Our music ranges from Christian music to secular \n        rock, blues or jazz. Each meeting is sensational for helping non-Christians \n        come to a relationship with Jesus Christ, grounding new believers and \n        challenging more mature believers. </p>\n      <p>Several  of our elders, as Senior Sphere Leaders, are the regular Central Teaching teachers at different venues. They have a primary responsibility to teach and lead their own Spheres, but we strive to have them rotate periodically to other Sphere CTs whenever possible.      </p>\n      <p>In parallel with our Central Teaching meeting times for adults, we also \n        offer excellent programs on-site for infants, toddlers, and school-aged \n      children, called &#x93;Oasis&#x94;. For junior-high students, we hold parallel meetings at our Building X  youth facility. This frees up parents and \n        children alike to enjoy a teaching and meeting designed just for them. \n      </p>\n      <h3>Which home groups attend which Central Teaching?</h3>\n      <p>We strongly encourage home groups to join together to &#x93;host&#x94; \n        a meeting by designating one of the CT times as their primary meeting. \n        This is good for the home group, since they can meet each other&#x92;s \n        guests and have additional time together. It&#x92;s also good for the \n        meeting, since the different home groups provide the volunteers and the \n        ideas needed to make all aspects of the meeting enjoyable, \n        including the time afterward.</p>\n      <p>To get connected: Join the e-mail group for your CT to share ideas and \n        receive pertinent announcements.

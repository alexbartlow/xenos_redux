But theirs was no ordinary \n          underground newspaper. <i>The Fish</i> derived its name from the Greek \n          word for \"fish,\" <i>Icthus</i>, which was also an acronym \n          used by early Christians meaning \"Jesus Christ, God's Son, the \n          Savior.\" <i>The Fish</i> was dedicated to helping other students \n          discover that Jesus Christ holds the key for humanity's problems.</p>\n        <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/aboutxenos/graphics/fish.png\" alt=\"Early editions of The Fish\" width=\"200\">Their \n          rooming house on East 16th Avenue was no ordinary student house either. \n          Known as \"The Fish House\" because of its association with \n          the paper, it became a center for regular Bible studies. These meetings, \n          referred to as \"The Fish House Fellowship\" attracted students \n          searching for answers during turbulent times. Future co-lead pastor, \n          <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/personal/gary.htm\">Gary DeLashmutt</a> moved into the house \n          in 1971.</p>\n        <p><i>The Fish</i> newspaper has long since vanished, but today the Bible\n           studies it spawned are flourishing. The old Fish House Fellowship,\n          which \n          adopted the name \"Xenos Christian Fellowship\" in 1982, has\n           grown into an interdenominational, evangelical church that, as of\n          2004, \n          includes more than 4,500 people from all walks of life.</p>\n        <h3>Foundations </h3><table width=\"180\">\n          <tr><td><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/aboutxenos/graphics/denatlake.jpg\" width=\"180\"><h4>Dennis McCallum, 1970</h4></td></tr></table>\n\t\t    <p>For years, Xenos was a disorganized association of house-based groups \n          scattered around the campus of The Ohio State University and the north \n          side of Columbus. The leading figures who began the group continued \n          to set direction through counsel and personal influence rather than \n          through leadership offices. From the beginning Xenos leaders encouraged \n          individual Bible teachers and evangelists to start home study groups \n          as they were able, sharing knowledge informally. By 1974, the fellowship \n          consisted of a dozen different groups comprising more than 200 people. \n        </p>\n\t\t    <table width=\"150\">\n          <tr> \n            <td><h4>By 1974, the fellowship consisted of a dozen different groups \n                comprising more than 200 people.</h4></td>\n          </tr>\n        </table>\n        <p>During this period, the group's theology was influenced most by four \n          strangely contradictory sources: Francis Schaeffer and the L'Abri group, \n          Plymouth Brethren teaching as typified by authors like T. Austin Sparks \n          and Miles Stanford, grace-oriented Bible commentary like that of William \n          R. Newell and Watchman Nee. Yet, such eclectic approaches were common \n          in the milieu of the Jesus revolution, which was in full swing in those \n          years. The theological emphases they gleaned from these authors were: \n          (1) The centrality of the grace of God 2) The importance of learning \n          Christian truth content--including the Bible, theology, church history \n          and contemporary social criticism. (3) The importance of staying in \n          touch with contemporary culture.

These men were instrumental \n          in the early equipping of Xenos leaders and Xenos enjoyed an alliance \n          with groups in town these men had founded. But when Walker and Nethery \n          joined a larger group and moved in a different direction theologically \n          in 1974, Xenos leaders broke with them and the associated groups in \n          our area. Nethery later also broke with the group, which eventually \n          became convinced that the Eastern Orthodox tradition is the truest expression \n          of the Body of Christ. Today they have become Eastern Orthodox priests, \n          while Xenos has continued to develop the ideals they taught earlier, \n          including a return to primitive Christianity as seen in the New Testament. \n        </p>\n        <p>After struggling with whether the interpretive community of the post-apostolic \n          fathers should be considered authoritative today, Xenos leaders finally \n          and definitely settled on a view that church tradition should have no \n          authority whatsoever in the life of the church. They concluded that \n          all authority accorded tradition is at the direct expense of biblical \n          authority. Although these same leaders later got graduate degrees in \n          historical theology, they have come to see the history of interpretation \n          as important for comparison, but in no way determinative in understanding \n          the Bible. The incident had the effect of confirming Xenos' radically \n          non-traditional path. Xenos teachers continue to see human tradition \n          as more often the enemy of good exegesis than a help. While recognizing \n          that no group is without traditions, we see all human tradition, including \n          our own, as carrying the dangerous potential of becoming an idol&#x97;a \n          familiar pattern of thought and practice to which people often will \n          cling, even if it means defying God's will and causing lost people to \n          stay lost. </p>\n        <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/aboutxenos/graphics/compass.gif\" width=\"220\">At that time, several leaders, including the two main teachers for \n          the group, McCallum and DeLashmutt, decided to seek formal graduate \n          study. They went to Los Angeles where they studied for two years at \n          Christian Associates Seminary, an unaccredited seminary specializing \n          in training leaders of \"street-oriented\" ministries. Most \n          of the seminary's faculty had been Campus Crusade staffers earlier in \n          their careers.</p>\n        <h3>A Different Kind of Church</h3>\n        <table width=\"120\">\n          <tr>\n            <td><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/Dennis_portrait.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis\" width=\"131\">\n            <h4><span class=\"style2\">Dennis McCallum today. </span>Watch his <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/teachings/\">multimedia teachings.</a> </h4></td></tr>\n        </table>\n        <p>Upon returning to Columbus in 1976, the group from California joined \n          those leaders who had remained behind to take up leadership of the now \n          smaller group of about 60 students. An eldership was elected and they \n          set about starting new home Bible study groups, some for students and \n          some for adults. McCallum's mother, Martha, had been active in teaching \n          home Bible studies for several years and was instrumental in starting \n          several groups. </p>\n        <table width=\"120\">\n          <tr>\n            <td><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/gary.jpg\" width=\"110\">\n                <h4>Gary DeLashmutt today.

The group shared a dread of shallowness, \n          of outward \"churchy\" piety, and of formalism. McCallum and\n          DeLashmutt envisioned a radically involved church where everyone took\n          part in ministry, virtually erasing the usual clergy-laity distinction\n          in western Christianity. They saw the importance of keeping the church\n          outward focused, and sought to avoid what they perceived as a tendency\n          in the American church to be inward-focused and out of touch with contemporary\n          culture. Evangelism and personal discipleship were the means for building\n          the church. In Xenos, all leaders sought to disciple\n        younger believers, and that was supposed to lead to duplication. Duplication\n        of mature Christians would hopefully lead to duplication of house churches.\n        And as house churches multiplied, a church planting movement would erupt.\n        To the present day, Xenos strives to be a church planting movement.</p>\n        <table width=\"150\">\n          <tr> \n            <td height=\"81\"><h4>By 1980, the group had grown to more than 400 \n                adults.</h4></td>\n          </tr>\n        </table>\n        <p>Very quickly, people were attracted to the Bible studies they started.\n           By 1980, the group had grown to more than 500 adults. During this\n          entire \n          period, all leadership participated on a volunteer basis. McCallum,\n           DeLashmutt and many other teachers made their livings as house painters.\n          \n          That year, the group decided to open a bank account so they could lease\n           space for their meetings. They leased 9,000 square feet in an office-warehouse&#x97;a\n            venue unimaginatively dubbed \"Building 4,\" from its name\n            in  the complex. Others called it \"The Warehouse.\" Not\n            until 1981  did Xenos hire its first paid staff, as McCallum and\n            DeLashmutt were \n          placed on part-time salary. By now the church had grown to nearly 800\n             members. During the decade in which there were no paid leaders in\n            the \n          church, Xenos members developed deep convictions about lay ministry.\n             To this day, Xenos members shoulder the bulk of ministry including\n            extensive \n          training. Xenos leaders are convinced that without the many years of\n             serving as soldiers at their own expense, they never would have\n            been \n          able to develop the same level of certainty about the equality of all\n             members' responsibility for ministry. </p>\n        <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/aboutxenos/graphics/xenmag.png\" alt=\"Xenos Magazine\" width=\"250\">When \n          it became evident that \"The Fish House Fellowship\" was becoming \n          a large church, the leadership decided to incorporate the church under \n          Ohio law. The group had been publishing a magazine called <em>Xenos \n          Magazine</em>, and they decided to call the new corporation Xenos Christian \n          Fellowship. The name <em>Xenos</em> is derived from a Greek word whose \n          primary use in the New Testament denotes sojourners in a foreign land, \n          a biblical description of Christians whose ultimate home is in heaven. \n          A secondary usage of the word <em>xenos</em> denotes \"one who provides \n          hospitality.\" \n        </p><p>From the beginning, Xenos has strived to reach not only unchurched \n          people, but anti-church people&#x97;those who are determined to stay \n          away from more traditional churches. This is why Xenos reaches out with \n          the message of Christ in an unconventional, contemporary, informal setting. \n          Visitors from other churches are often confused and even startled by \n          how different Xenos meetings are from other churches. We don't feel \n          we are trying to be strange as an end in itself, but for <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/aboutxenos/strange.htm\">reasons \n          that arise out of our unique calling</a>.</p>\n        <h3>Rapid Growth </h3>\n        <p>As the home Bible studies, or \"home churches\" multiplied \n          and spread throughout the city, they became increasingly successful \n          at reaching not only students, but also people in their 30s, 40s, and \n          50s. Xenos leaders increasingly sensed the potential of a self-replicating \n          house-church movement for reaching the lost. The leadership team in \n          each house church sets as its goal from the beginning to raise up new \n          leadership and plant a new home church. </p>\n        <p>In addition to home groups, McCallum and DeLashmutt each led a so-called \"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/ct/ct.htm\">Central Teaching</a>.\" \n          The Central Teachings were labeled \"central\" because clusters\n          of home groups would share space at these lectures. One Central Teaching\n          was comprised mainly of students, the other mainly adults. </p>\n        <p>During the 1980s, the church also developed a fairly elaborate system \n          of <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/index.htm\">coursework </a>intended to support \n          home church leaders in their efforts to raise up qualified new leaders. \n          Every quarter, hundreds of people would take courses, most of which \n          met for two- to three-hour sessions every Wednesday evening. The courses \n          generally charged tuition of $30 to $50, assigned homework, and gave \n          graded quizzes and tests. Students had to pass a minimum list of courses \n          in order to qualify as a home church leader. </p>\n        <p>Between 1980 and 1984, the number of participants in home churches \n          doubled every 18 months. By then, the total number of participants had \n          reached 2,050. Concurrently, the number of lay leaders rose from 50 \n          in 1980 to more than 200 in 1984. The two Central Teachings grew accordingly. \n          We added a third Central Teaching in 1986, a fourth in 1988.</p>\n        <h3>A Different Decade </h3>\n        <p>By 1991, Xenos had grown to more than 3,500 people. Because of the\n           hundreds of children now involved, the \"Warehouse\" no longer\n            could meet the group's needs. The elders made the decision that the\n           \n          church needed to build a facility to house the increasingly complicated\n            ministry of the church.</p>\n        <p>As the church searched for a suitable site that would not limit future\n           growth, the membership had to face several grave issues, including\n          our \n          longtime tradition of weak giving to the local church. Although Xenos\n           members had a strong ethic of self-sacrifice, giving had never been\n          strong. \n          Xenos meetings never passed the plate, but merely referred to a box\n           in the rear where people could leave donations. Our annual budget\n          was \n          barely over $1 million with attendance of 3500! To the displeasure\n           of some, the leaders began taking formal collections, and organized\n          \n          a pledge system and a <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/fst.htm\">fiscal support\n           team</a> to take the lead in fiscal matters. Today, the church gives\n           nearly five times per capita what they did then.</p>\n        <p>During the early 90's Xenos underwent internal\n          upheaval, eventually resulting in our first large-scale church division.\n          The\n          causes for\n          the \n          division were complicated, involving some interpersonal, affective\n          conflict. But the differences also included important issues of substance.\n          Many\n          \n          members came to distrust some elders, who were taking the church\n          in  new directions but were unable to reach their goals, such as erecting\n          \n          the new facility. Some members interpreted this failure as a sign that\n           God's power had departed from the leadership of the church. The introduction\n          \n          of new features like formal pledges and collections were also seen\n          by  some as a sellout of the original Xenos vision. </p>\n        <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/aboutxenos/graphics/buildmix.gif\" width=\"300\">In addition to these problems, the leadership of the church was divided \n          over issues of doctrine and practice. A group of leaders and counselors \n          in the church were increasingly involved in victim advocacy, including \n          recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse, occult ritual sexual abuse, \n          and an emphasis on the emotional lives of Christians, as over against \n          what was pejoratively called a \"functional approach\" to Christian \n          living. Some leaders were calling for an approach to Christian leadership \n          that the elders felt would exclude leaders' ability to call for a high \n          level of commitment even when some members felt marginalized by such \n          calls. During a colloquium scheduled by the elders to voice views on \n          these issues, the different sides in the dispute wrote papers and debated \n          their views. A large meeting of the whole church followed where leaders \n          and elders presented their areas of agreement and disagreement. But \n          none of these measures resulted in a resolution to the growing conflict \n          over the future vision for the church. </p>\n        <p>This dispute also correlated with the rise of the so-called Toronto\n           blessing. Some Xenos members were caught up in related area conferences\n          and urged other members to join in. Xenos elders decided this revival\n          reflected extremist views and practices that had no place in Xenos\n          Fellowship,\n          and went\n          on record\n        publicly with their criticisms to the dismay of many members.</p>\n        <p>To add to the confusion, Xenos elders picked this time to completely \n          reorganize the church! Home fellowship groups were diversified and the \n          ministry was divided into five divisions. Full-time administrators were \n          hired to take over the bulk of administrative burden. Such sudden change \n          added to the impression that the leaders of the church were lurching \n          away from the church's historic approach, where everything was handled \n          in an informal and rather disorganized way. </p>\n        <p>As dissent in the church reached a crescendo in 1993, there were calls\n          for founder, Dennis McCallum, to resign. He and the other elders met\n          to discuss whether they were somehow in the wrong for their direction,\n          or whether the problem was more the result of a negative attitude toward\n          human leadership in general. </p>\n        <p>Finally, the elders decided to \"have\n          it out\" with the dissident group in the church. At a meeting of\n          all church leaders and their spouses (about 500 people) they announced\n          there would be a debate on the suitability of our current elders to\n          lead the church. They urged everyone to bring their suspicions and\n          complaints out in public, and after three hours of debate, the group\n          would vote on whether to keep or remove each existing elder. Instead,\n          the debate began at 9:00 A.M. and lasted until 5:00 P.M. without a\n          break! After heated exchanges, complete with accusations and counter-accusations,\n          the leaders\n          voted. All existing elders were retained by margins of not less than\n          85%. Two-thirds majority had been required to pass.</p>\n        <p>After the referendum, Xenos elders decided to authorize McCallum\n          to set in writing his <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/vision.htm\">vision for the\n          church</a>.\n            After revisions by the rest of the elders, they presented the paper\n            to a meeting of the combined leadership and called for a vote of\n            affirmation\n            from the majority. The paper established a <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/steam.htm\">Servant\n             Team</a> with new restrictions and requirements for leaders in the\n            church. The paper was affirmed by 85 percent of the 350 leaders and\n            staff, much\n            to the dismay of a vocal minority. </p>\n        <p>People began to leave. During 1993 and 1994, more than 1,400 people\n           left the church. The church, now down to 2,100 in attendance, went\n          through \n          a period of recovery as members sought to recover our earlier focus\n           as a cell-based church. Within two years, the church again began to\n          \n          grow, and today about 5000 people attend our meetings.\n          The changes in the Servant Team have proven to be a great success,\n          and\n          today, the team numbers more than 800 members. </p>\n        <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/aboutxenos/graphics/Xenoscampus.png\" alt=\"The Xenos campus today\" width=\"250\" hspace=\"10\" class=\"block\">Notwithstanding \n          the chaos of those years, we find ourselves today happy with the organization \n          and tone of the church, and we feel we are headed for a great future. \n          We succeeded in erecting our facility in 1997, and have seen excellent \n          growth and morale in the church as a result. </p>\n        <h3>Our Ministry Today</h3>\n        <p>Aside from our numerous home fellowship groups, Xenos conducts ministry \n          through <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/minteam.htm\">ministry teams</a>. These teams \n          go through an accreditation process after developing a defined ministry \n          plan. Some of the key ministry teams in the church include: </p>\n        <h4><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/homegroups/index.htm\">Home Groups</a></h4>\n        <p>\"Home churches,\" are the backbone of Xenos home group ministry. \n          These groups usually range from 15-60 people who meet for fellowship \n          and Bible teaching. Home churches are also open to non-Christian neighbors \n          and friends, and are a major entry point for new people into the church. \n          Each home church also has a discipleship program involving men's and \n          women's groups and supervised ministry experience, usually combined \n          with some one-on-one mentoring. By the end of a typical three-year cycle, \n          the leadership team of a given home church tries to have a new leadership \n          team in place, along with new members and discipleship groups. When \n          everything is ready, the group has a harvest meeting where testimonies \n          are shared, and the group divides to plant a new home church.</p>\n        <h4> <strong><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/equip.htm\">Training</a></strong></h4>\n        <p>In the mid-1970s, Xenos began offering courses for those wanting to \n          expand their knowledge of the Bible and ministry skills. Today, we offer \n          one series of courses that revolve around leadership training and another \n          that focuses on introductory information aimed at young Christians and \n          those investigating Christianity. </p>\n        <p>Our <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/index.htm\">courses</a> address theology, biblical \n          studies, counseling, family life, and other subjects of interest to \n          members. Xenos has developed much of its own curricula, which is regularly \n          taught by the church's pastors and other trained teachers and professionals. \n        </p>\n        <p>The <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/studycenter/index.htm\">Study Center</a>, \n          is Xenos' lending library and place to prepare for leading home group. \n          The center offers a unique place to study, set in a wooded ravine with \n          a deck and stream. We maintain an extensive audio and video tape library, \n          in addition to thousands of books that address Christianity and related \n          disciplines from a variety of perspectives. Our index of Study Center \n          resources are computerized for quick access, and most books are available \n          for loan.</p>\n        <h4><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/evang.htm\">Adult Outreach </a></h4>\n        <p>Most of our adult outreach occurs at the ever-popular public lectures \n          we call Central Teachings. We also see big results from innovative outreach \n          projects such as <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/playgroups.htm\">Play \n          Groups</a> and <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc1.htm\">Conversation \n          and Cuisine</a> groups. </p>\n        <p>Xenos began as a student movement, but during the 1980s, the student \n          component in the church gradually decreased. During the '90s, the church \n          launched a determined effort to recover our voice with secondary and \n          college students in our area. The campaign has been successful, as students \n          in this age range increased from under 200 to around 1,000 by 2004. \n        </p>\n        <h4><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/studnt.htm\"><strong>Student Ministries</strong></a></h4>\n        <p>For younger kids, <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/aboutxenos/www.xenosschools.org\">Xenos Christian Schools</a> \n          has three locations in Columbus, Ohio, offering quality academic and \n          biblical education. <br>\n          Calumet Christian School, founded in 1983 by Xenos Christian Fellowship, \n          includes preschool through grade 8; Xenos Christian School, started \n          in 1997, offers preschool through grade 5; Harambee Christian School, \n          our urban program, opened in 1998 with full-day kindergarten, and now \n          has classes through grade 5. </p>\n        <p>Our popular children's ministry operating during Central Teachings \n          is called <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/oasis/index.htm\">Oasis</a>. Leaders \n          of this ministry have written their own curriculum, available on this \n          site. </p>\n        <h4><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/extrel.htm\">External Relations</a></h4>\n        <p>Xenos' External Relations division forges relationships with other \n          churches to explore cooperative ministries and ways to share resources. \n          This division also enhances the community's understanding of Xenos and \n          demonstrates unity among Christians. We offer conferences for the larger \n          church in our area and maintain this web site. Xenos also maintains \n          membership in interdenominational missions networks, such as the Association \n          of Church Missions Committees. </p>\n        <h4><a href=\"http://urbanconcern.org\">Urban Concern</a></h4>\n        <p>Xenos is strong in the conviction that God has given us blessing only \n          so we can share his love with others in need. In 1991 we launched Urban \n          Concern with the mission of transforming one of the most disadvantaged \n          neighborhoods in Columbus. </p>\n        <p>Urban Concern seeks to empower individuals and families to be agents of positive change in South Linden and the world. Our strategy is to raise up indigenous leadership in a targeted area of Columbus. We accomplish this \n          mission through various activities, including a private inner city school, \n          an after school program, spiritual mentoring, \n          job training, community development activities, and more.</p>\n        <h4> <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/missions/worldmin.htm\"><strong>World Ministries \n          </strong></a> </h4>\n        <p>World Ministries provide opportunities for every Christian to be involved \n          in evangelism and the establishment of churches among non-Christian \n          peoples around the world. Today, Xenos has planted teams in Southeast \n          Asia, Eastern Europe, Taiwan and Cambodia.</p>\n        <p>The <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/missions/mobilization\">Missions Mobilization</a> \n          department educates and mobilizes Xenos members for worldwide evangelism.</p>\n        <p>Volunteers also coordinate <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/missions/hsupport.htm\">Home \n          Support Teams</a>, who are dedicated to supporting the needs of our \n          mission fields.</p>\n        \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      </div> \n     \n    </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/Dennis_portrait.jpg","title":"History of Xenos Christian Fellowship","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/aboutxenos/history.htm"}

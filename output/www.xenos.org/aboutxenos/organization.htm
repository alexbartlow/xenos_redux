Our six divisions each have their own \n        coordinator on staff, and usually several staff department heads. The \n        coordinators meet with the lead elders to form the management team. They \n        are in turn responsible, through the lead elders, to the board of elders.</p>\n      <h3>Adult Ministries</h3>\n      <p>Xenos is a national leader in forming and operating <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/homegroups/index.htm\">home \n        groups</a>. We provide scores of home groups under several different models. \n        This division oversees both home groups and our <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/ct/ct.htm\">Central \n        Teachings</a> (CT). Sphere leaders are responsible for each sphere of \n        home groups organized by the CT they attend, providing better support \n        and a sense of community at CTs.</p>\n      <h3><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/equip.htm\">Equipping Ministries</a></h3>\n      <p>At Xenos, we are convinced that equipping lay people for ministry is \n        the key to healthy growth.

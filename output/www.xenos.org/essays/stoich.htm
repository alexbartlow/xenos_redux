First, I will conduct a brief examination of the non-biblical\r\nand biblical usage of <i>stoicheion</i> (\"elementary principles\"). Next, I will\r\nanalyze the three traditional interpretations of the phrase. Finally, I will adopt and\r\napply one of those interpretations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Extra-Biblical Usage of <i>stoicheian</i></h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>By the fourth century B. C., the verbal form of the root (<i>stoicheo</i>) was used to\r\nmean \"to be in a line,\" \"to march in rank and file.\"<a href=\"#Footnote1B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote1A\"> Footnote1</a> The New Testament usage of the\r\nverb <i>stoicheo</i> retains an element of this usage in the five times that it is used.<a href=\"#Footnote2B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote2A\"> Footnote2</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The general meaning of the noun form (<i>stoicheion</i>) was \"what belongs to a\r\nseries.\"<a href=\"#Footnote3B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote3A\"> Footnote3</a> It developed\r\nfive different but related meanings from this same period (fourth century B.C.) and later\r\npre-Christian literature. <i>Stoicheion</i> was used to mean variously \"the length of\r\na shadow on the sundial,\" \"part of a syllable or a word,\" \"the\r\nessential elements of the cosmos,\" \"smallest parts (of anything) which stand in\r\nrelation to one another,\" and \"the stars or astral bodies as elements of\r\nfire.\"<a href=\"#Footnote4B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote4A\"> Footnote4</a> According to\r\nDelling, <i>stoicheion</i> came to be identified with \"stellar spirits associated\r\nwith those heavenly bodies\" only after the New Testament was written.<a href=\"#Footnote5B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote5A\"> Footnote5</a> This fact becomes important in\r\nthe interpretation of the Pauline passages.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Non-Pauline New Testament Usage</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The noun form <i>stoicheion</i> is used only seven times in the New Testament. Apart\r\nfrom Paul's use of it in Gal. 4:3,9 and Col. 2:8,20, Peter uses it in 2&#160;Pet. 3:10,12\r\nand the author of Hebrews uses it in Heb. 5:12. In each of these non-Pauline usages, <i>stoicheion</i>\r\nis used in one of its classical meanings. In 2 Pet. 3, it clearly refers to the physical\r\nelements of the universe which will be destroyed by the Lord at the end of the age. The\r\nauthor of Hebrews uses it to refer to basic or elementary teachings, either about Jesus or\r\nOld Testament religion.<a href=\"#Footnote6B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote6A\"> Footnote6</a> </p>\r\n<i>\r\n\r\n<h3>Ta Stoicheia Tou Kosmou</h3>\r\n</i>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p>See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow philosophy and empty deception,\r\n  according to the tradition of men, according to the <i>elementary principles of the world</i>,\r\n  rather than according to Christ. . .If you have died with Christ to <i>the elementary\r\n  principles of the world</i>, why, as if you were living in the world, do you submit\r\n  yourself to decrees such as, \"Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!\". . .\r\n  (Col. 2:8,20,21)</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p>So we, while we were children, were held in bondage under <i>the elementary principles\r\n  of the world</i>&#160;. . .&#160;But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be\r\n  known by God, how is it that you turn back again to <i>the weak and worthless elementary\r\n  things</i>, to which you desire to be enslaved all over again? You observe days and months\r\n  and seasons and years. (Gal.&#160;3:3,9,10)<a href=\"#Footnote7B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote7A\">\r\n  Footnote7</a></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul uses the phrase \"of the world\" (<i>tou kosmou</i>) to describe<i> </i>\"the\r\nelementary principles\" in three of his four usage's of <i>ta stoicheia</i>. It is\r\nobvious that Paul is using the phrase \"of the world\" in a negative sense. In the\r\nremaining usage of \"the elementary principles\" (Gal. 4:9), Paul clearly intends\r\nthe same negative meaning as the other three because he describes them with the phrase\r\n\"weak and worthless.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In both letters, Paul is refuting false teachings which have infiltrated the churches.\r\nIt seems evident that the Colossian heresy was some sort of Greek-Jewish synthesis,\r\nperhaps a form of proto-gnosticism. The Galatian heresy appears to be a form of\r\ntraditional Palestinian Judaism which insists that the Galatian Christians also take on\r\nthe Old Testament law as a requisite for salvation. It is the view of this author that its\r\nadvocates were the \"Judaizer\" party of the Jerusalem church which was later\r\ndenounced by the Jerusalem Council recorded in Acts 15.<a href=\"#Footnote8B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote8A\"> Footnote8</a> In both cases, Old Testament practices are being\r\nprescribed in a way which undercuts the full sufficiency of Jesus' work on the cross, thus\r\ncalling forth some of Paul's clearest written teaching on the subject of the finished work\r\nof Christ (Col. 2:10-15; Gal. 2:16-21). </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Three Classical Interpretations</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Three classical interpretations of \"the elementary principles of the world\"\r\nhave been formulated, though each interpretation has a number of variations. The following\r\nis a summary of those interpretations, their leading advocates, and the main support and\r\nproblems for each view.<a href=\"#Footnote9B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote9A\"> Footnote9</a></p>\r\n<b>\r\n\r\n</b><p>The Law of Israel</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The first view holds that Paul is referring to the Law of Israel. This view, which is\r\nadvocated by Lightfoot, Stott and Tenney among others, stresses the way in which Paul\r\nconnects being \"under the Law\" in Gal. 3:23; 4:5 with being \"under the\r\nelementary principles of the world\" in Gal. 4:3. It also cites the fact that in each\r\ncase, the heretics are prescribing Old Testament laws (see Col. 2:16,21; Gal. 4:10). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certainly there <i>is</i> a connection between these two concepts, but it is\r\noverstating the case to call them synonymous for at least two reasons. First, it seems\r\nunlikely for Paul to call \"the world\" the origin of the Law of Israel. In Gal.\r\n3:19-23, Paul teaches that God gave the Law to keep Israel under custody until the coming\r\nof Messiah. Whatever this may mean, it certainly affirms the divine origin of the Law and\r\nits essential righteousness. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest problem with this interpretation is that it does not account for the fact\r\nthat in both passages, Paul also uses this phrase to refer to Gentile and/or heretical\r\nteachings. In Col. 2:8, Paul refers to \"philosophy and empty deception, according to\r\nthe tradition of men, according to `the elementary principles of the world,' rather than\r\naccording to Christ.\" This passage makes it clear that the phrase refers to something\r\noriginating from the sphere of man rather than from Christ. In Gal. 4:9, Paul says that\r\nthe Galatians are in danger of returning again to the <i>stoicheia</i>, when their first\r\ninvolvement with them was pagan idolatry (vs. 8). Therefore, this interpretation is\r\ninadequate as a full explanation of the phrase.</p>\r\n<b>\r\n\r\n</b><p>The Demonic Spirits</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Most scholars argue that Paul is referring to the satanic demons which have originated\r\nthe false teachings which Paul is refuting. Paul calls them \"the elementary\r\nprinciples of the world\" because the heretics were referring to them as the\r\nspirit-beings which rule over the heavens. Far from being a superior revelation from God\r\nwhich will bring them spiritual liberation, Paul ironically implies that this teaching\r\noriginates from demons and will therefore only bring them into bondage. Among the scholars\r\nwho hold this view are Boice, <a href=\"#Footnote10B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote10A\">Footnote10</a>\r\nF. F. Bruce, Vaughn, Guthrie and Carson.<a href=\"#Footnote11B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote11A\">\r\nFootnote11</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Support for this interpretation is found from a number of sources. The fact most cited\r\nby the above authors is that \"the elementary principles\" is used in\r\nextra-biblical literature to refer to the stellar spirits which were identified with the\r\nheavenly bodies. <a href=\"#Footnote12B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote12A\">Footnote12</a> Both\r\npassages also make reference to angels in some relationship to the phrase. In\r\nGal.&#160;3:19, Paul refers to angels as the mediators through which God gave the Law. In\r\nGal.&#160;4:8, he speaks of \"those which are by nature no gods\" which the\r\nGalatians formerly worshipped, and then seemingly applies \"the elementary\r\nprinciples\" to them in vs. 9. In Col. 2:18, Paul speaks of \"the worship of\r\nangels\" as part of the heresy associated with the \"the elementary\r\nprinciples.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are, however, several problems with this view. The most formidable problem is\r\nthat Paul's usage of \"the elementary principles\"<i> </i>definitely includes the\r\nLaw of Israel (see above). It is very difficult to see how the worship of stellar spirits\r\ncould be construed by Paul to be a part of Old Testament Law when it specifically\r\nprohibits such worship (see Ex. 20:3-5). The references to dietary laws (Col. 2:16) and\r\ncalendar observances (Gal. 4:10) are obviously Old Testament, but many of those who hold\r\nthis view try unsuccessfully to prove that they are actually Greek practices.<a href=\"#Footnote13B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote13A\"> Footnote13</a> This is a serious weakness\r\nof the view, especially for the Galatians passage, because it is impossible that the\r\nJudaizers were prescribing astrological observances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Delling deals what seems to be a lethal blow to this view. He claims that <i>stoicheion</i>\r\nwas not used to refer to spiritual beings prior to the fourth century A.D.<a href=\"#Footnote14B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote14A\"> Footnote14</a> Ladd states that the word\r\nwas not applied to the astral deities until the third century A.D.<a href=\"#Footnote15B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote15A\"> Footnote15</a> If this is the case, this interpretation must be\r\nseriously questioned because it depends upon a meaning for \"the elementary\r\nprinciples\" which did not come into use until much later.</p>\r\n<b>\r\n\r\n</b><p>Religious Principles</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Ridderbos, Ladd, Brown, Longenecker, Rendall and Delling<a href=\"#Footnote16B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote16A\"> Footnote16</a> interpret \"the elementary principles of the\r\nworld\" to refer to religion before and apart from Christ. Understanding \"the\r\nelementary principles\" in the sense of \"rudimentary principles,\" it sees\r\nPaul contrasting all religions in a negative light compared to the way to God opened by\r\nJesus Christ. Even Old Testament Judaism, which once had a limited validity, has now been\r\nreplaced by Christ. To return to it is to return to a state of inferior spiritual status\r\nsimilar in some way to that of pagan idolatry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This interpretation has the advantage of being able to apply to both Old Testament\r\nJudaism and the Gentile religions and philosophies, a major problem with the two previous\r\ninterpretations. It also explains why even the Law is cast in a negative light. Apart from\r\nthe work of Christ which it foreshadowed, it too can lead only to slavery (see Gal.\r\n3:22,23). Now that Christ has come, it is only a \"weak and worthless\" system\r\n(Gal. 4:9), a mere shadow (Col. 2:17) that should be discarded. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This view, however, is not without problems. The biggest problem is that it \r\n  makes Paul designate even the Old Testament Law as \"of the world\" \r\n  (Gal. 4:3). He likewise seems to say in Col. 2:8 that the \"the elementary \r\n  principles of the world\" are synonymous with \"the traditions of men.\" \r\n  This runs counter to the divine origin of the Law. There are two different ways \r\n  in which scholars deal with this problem.</p>\r\n<b>\r\n\r\n</b><p>The Perversion of the Law</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Ridderbos and Ladd contend that Paul is speaking of the perversion of the Old Testament\r\nLaw into a legalistic, humanistic system of justification and sanctification. These\r\nscholars point out that both the Colossian heresy and the Judaizers in Galatia were in\r\nfact perverting the Law into such a system. This would account for Paul's designation of\r\nit as \"according to the traditions of men\" and \"of the world.\" Though\r\nthe Law was originated by God, its misuse originates from the world of fallen man. This\r\nview would also make sense of Paul's description of all these systems as \"weak and\r\nworthless\" (Gal.&#160;4:9).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major problem with this view is that it does not deal adequately with the language\r\nand context of Gal. 4:3-5. Here Paul teaches that he, other Jews and Jesus Himself were\r\nall \"under the Law\" and \"under the elementary principles of the world\"\r\n(he uses the terms interchangeably). While it may be argued that Paul and other Jews were\r\nunder a legalistic perversion of the Law, the same cannot be claimed for Jesus. He\r\ndefinitely rejected the rabbinic interpretation of the Law as a means of righteousness and\r\nrefused to live under it in that way. Furthermore, the context of Gal. 3:19-23 uses the\r\nphrase \"under the Law\" in the sense that it was accomplishing God's intended\r\npurpose in shutting up all men under sin and thus preparing them for their Savior-Messiah\r\nJesus. In this author's opinion, these two problems render this view improbable.</p>\r\n<b>\r\n\r\n</b><p>The Outdated Law</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Brown, Delling, Longenecker and Rendall insist that in addition to human philosophies\r\nand religions, Paul is referring to the Old Testament Law in its proper sense. The Law was\r\nvalid because it foreshadowed the work of Christ and made people aware of their need for\r\nforgiveness, but it is now no longer valid because the New Covenant for which it made\r\npreparation has now come. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This view has several advantages. It clearly allows for the Jewish meaning of the\r\nprescriptions of Col. 2:16,21 and Gal. 4:10. It allows for the obvious sense of the phrase\r\n\"under the Law\" in Gal. 3:19-4:5. It explains why Paul can refer even to the Law\r\nas \"weak and worthless\" because, as Heb. 7:18,19 says,\r\n\"&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;there is the setting aside of the former commandment\r\nbecause of its weakness and uselessness (for the Law made nothing\r\nperfect)&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This view also explains why Paul can link the Law with human religions. What validity\r\nthe Old Testament Law once had is now gone since its fulfillment has come. To go back to a\r\nimpersonal religious system after a personal relationship with God is now possible through\r\nthe indwelling Holy Spirit is to go back to a state no better (in that sense) than\r\npaganism (Gal. 4:6-11). While Paul stops short of calling the Law \"false\" in the\r\nsame sense as pagan religions, he insists that going under it as a Christian is a\r\nreversion as serious as relapse into idolatry (Gal. 4:8-10).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major problem with this view is the origin which Paul ascribes to these\r\n\"elementary principles.\" In Col. 2:8, he appears to use the phrase \"the\r\ntraditions of men\" synonymously with \"the elementary principles of the\r\nworld.\" The same problem exists with the phrase \"of the world.\" While a\r\nfitting description for pagan religions, both phrases imply a human origin for the Law,\r\neven though Paul says elsewhere that it originates from God. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, these problems can be resolved if one realizes that in both passages, Paul has\r\nespecially the ritual laws of Old Testament Judaism in view. Since these laws do not\r\nrelate directly to spiritual realities and had only a temporary, foreshadowing function,\r\nthey could be called \"of the world\" in the sense they pertain only to this\r\nworld.<a href=\"#Footnote17B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote17A\"> Footnote17</a> \"World\"\r\nis being used, as Ladd suggests, as \"&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;the whole complex of\r\nhuman earthly relationships&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;(which,\r\nthough)&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;not evil in itself&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;can stand\r\nbetween man and God.\"<a href=\"#Footnote18B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote18A\"> Footnote18</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon closer observation, Col. 2:8 does not necessarily insist that the \"traditions\r\nof men\" are synonymous with \"the elementary principles of the world.\" Paul\r\ncould be referring to two different sources of the Colossian heresy: the human\r\nreligio-philosophic source and the Old Testament ritual laws. At any rate, the grammar\r\ndoes not demand that the two phrases are synonymous.<a href=\"#Footnote19B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote19A\"> Footnote19</a> In vs. 16-23, Paul would be referring primarily to the\r\n(Old Testament) \"the elementary principles of the world,\" as indeed vs. 20\r\nindicates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In conclusion, the view that explains \"the elementary principles of the\r\nworld\"<i> </i>as pertaining to all religion (including the Old Testament Law and\r\nespecially its ritual system) before and outside of Christ is the most tenable position.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Application</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul's usage of \"the elementary principles of the world\"<i> </i>obviously\r\nwarns against syncretism of the gospel with any other human philosophic or religious\r\nsystem. This is the application most commonly pursued by preachers and expositors today.\r\nBut another important application of this phrase lies in the way Paul views Old Testament\r\nritual and the role of ritual in general.</p>\r\n<b>\r\n\r\n</b><p>Imposition of Old Testament Ritual</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly, these two passages warn against the imposition of Old Testament rituals on\r\nChristians. It is not just looking to those rituals as a means of justification before God\r\nthat is condemned; the observance of them as a sign of \"spirituality\" is\r\ninappropriate for the Christian because those rituals merely foreshadowed the\r\n\"substance,\" or reality, which Christians now enjoy in the person and work of\r\nJesus. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is true that Paul calls for patience with and even temporary deference to Christians\r\nwho do not yet understand the anachronism of Old Testament ritual law (Rom. 14; 1 Cor. 8).<a href=\"#Footnote20B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote20A\"> Footnote20</a> But note that he calls them\r\n\"weak in faith;\" they need to grow in their understanding of their freedom in\r\nChrist. On the other hand, those who already have that understanding<a href=\"#Footnote21B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote21A\"> Footnote21</a> are severely warned and censured for looking to Old\r\nTestament ritual observance as a means of salvation or spiritual growth. The result of\r\nthis, Paul insists, will be <i>not</i> spiritual growth, but rather spiritual regression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In view of these passages, it is difficult to understand how much of the church today\r\ncan defend its reliance on Old Testament ritual. Both direct and indirect implementation\r\nof this ritual law pervades much of the church.<a href=\"#Footnote22B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote22A\"> Footnote22</a> Church members are told that such observances are\r\nmandatory and that they constitute an essential (and in some cases, the primary)\r\nexpression of Christian spirituality. Paul completely denies the legitimacy of such\r\ncommands (Col. 2:16) and rejects the description of it as \"spirituality\" because\r\nit has no power over the flesh (Col. 2:23). I believe that a proper application of these\r\npassages would insist on an eradication of such practices from the church.</p>\r\n<b>\r\n\r\n</b><p>New Testament Ritualism</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>These two passages also warn in principle against the danger of ritualism even when the\r\nrituals involved are prescribed by the New Testament. \"Ritualism\" is being used\r\nhere in the sense of making ritual observance a primary focus of the Christian life and\r\nmeans of its expression. Water baptism and communion are the two rituals most often\r\nemployed in such \"New Testament\" ritualism, although foot-washing and other\r\npractices are sometimes also included. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Galatian passage in particular pits the religion of ritual observance against the\r\ngreat privilege of personally relating to God through the agency of the Holy Spirit.\r\nRitualism was legitimate (even necessary) during the Old Testament economy because this\r\nkind of personal relationship with God was not possible. But now God has made it possible\r\nto relate to him as <i>Abba</i>. The work of Christ and the gift of the Holy Spirit have\r\nmade it possible for us to be adopted into God's family. To go back to relating to God\r\nprimarily through ritual observance is to reject God's assessment of this gift. This is\r\nspiritual regression which is reprehensible enough to make Paul fear that he had labored\r\nin vain (vs 11)!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While New Testament rituals remain a legitimate aspect of Christianity, ritualism as\r\nthe means of relating to God has been \"outgrown\" and rejected. This is also the\r\nargument of the book of Hebrews (especially chapters 7-10). No church which focuses on\r\nritualism can claim to be a valid representation of Pauline Christianity. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to note that the number of rituals prescribed by Jesus are very few\r\ncompared to the Old Testament economy. It is also noteworthy that the way in which these\r\nrituals are to be observed is not explained in detail, again a sharp contrast to the Old\r\nTestament period. Since we live in the period of fulfillment of salvation rather than in\r\nthe period of promise, ritual takes on a lesser role. This fact, together with Paul's\r\nwarning in Gal. 4:1-11, should teach Christians that ritual plays a relatively minor role\r\nin their spiritual lives compared to their personal relationships with Christ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Return to the Essays page</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Return to the Xenos home page</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"mailto:DeLashmuttG@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=apostle%20paul\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ask\r\nGary a question or share a comment.</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"#Footnote1A\"></a><a name=\"Footnote1B\">Footnote1</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colin Brown, ed. <i>The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology</i>\r\n(Grand Rapids: Zondervan Publishing House, 1976), Vol. 2, p. 452.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"#Footnote2A\"></a><a name=\"Footnote2B\">Footnote2</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Acts 21:24 - James wants Paul to take a Nazarite vow, thus showing the Jews that he\r\n\"walks orderly (<i>stoicheis</i>), keeping the Law&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;\"\r\nPhil. 3:16 - Paul urges the Philippian Christians to \"keep living to that standard (<i>stoicheion</i>)\r\nto which we have attained.\" Gal. 6:16 - Referring to the new creation, Paul says,\r\n\"To those who walk by (<i>stoichesousin</i>) this rule, peace and mercy be upon\r\nthem&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;\" Gal. 5:25 - \"If we live by the Spirit, let us\r\nalso walk by (<i>stoichomen</i>) the Spirit.\" Rom. 4:12 - Specifying to whom the\r\npromise was given, Paul says, \"&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;those who follow in the\r\nsteps (<i>stoichousin</i>) of the faith of Abraham&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;\"\r\nDelling is careful to point out that <i>stoicheo</i> is not used synonymously with the\r\nother verbs meaning \"to walk\", but rather retains the stricter meaning of\r\n\"to be closely regulated by. \" See Gerhard Friedrich, ed<i>.

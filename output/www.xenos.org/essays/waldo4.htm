Europe was aflame with new religious\nmovements reacting to such things as the struggle of the Papacy for supremacy, the corrupt\npractices of local clergy, and the currents of thought that were flowing into the area as\na result of the Crusades.22 The Albigensians or the Cathari were the leading schismatic\ngroup,23 but there were many other attacks as well. In 1140 the bishops of France wrote to\nthe Pope that, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Everywhere in our cities and villages, not only in our schools but at the street\n  corners, learned and ignorant, great and small, are discussing the gravest mysteries.24 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the history of this period we find reference to numerous heretical groups, \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li>In 1259 the <i><b>Flagellants </b></i>appeared. By a kind of mass contagion men, women,\n    and children bewailed their sins and many of them marched through the streets, naked\n    except for loin cloths, crying to God for mercy, and scourging themselves until the blood\n    ran.25 \"They proclaimed complete certainty of salvation to all who should persevere\n    in flagellation for thirty-three days. Scourging was the one necessary sacrament. They\n    were condemned in 1349.\"26 </li>\n  <li>The <i><b>Beguines </b></i>comprised a variety of lay groups which seem not to have been\n    confined to any specific set of forms and to have displayed wide variety. Deansly says\n    they were, \"the followers of Lambert le Begue, (the Stammerer). . . devout but\n    unlettered lay people, who set great store on the use of vernacular scriptures. Lambert's\n    followers were called from his surname, in Dutch, Beghards, (whence the English word\n    \"beggar\") in Latin Beguini or Beguinae.\" She claims that the early\n    Waldensians joined forces with groups of Beguinae.27 </li>\n  <li><i><b>Tanchelm </b></i>began to preach in the diocese of Utrecht and early in the\n    twelfth century his views had fairly wide currency in the Low Countries and the Rhine\n    Valley. He attacked the entire structure of the Catholic Church, denied the authority of\n    the Church and of the Pope, and held that at least some of the sacraments were valueless. </li>\n  <li>Early in the twelfth century, <i><b>Peter of Bruys</b></i>, himself following a strictly\n    ascetic way of life, rejected the baptism of infants, the Eucharist, church buildings,\n    ecclesiastical ceremonies, prayers for the dead, and the veneration of the cross. The <i><b>Petrobrusians</b></i>\n    re-baptized those who joined them, profaned churches, burned crosses, and overthrew\n    altars. </li>\n  <li>Sometimes classed with Peter of Bruys, but perhaps mistakenly, was <i><b>Henry of\n    Lausanne</b></i>. Like the former he preached in what is now France and in the first half\n    of the twelfth century. Before his death in 1145 he is said to have attracted a wide\n    following, called <i><b>Henricians</b></i>. He taught that the sacraments were valid only\n    when administered by priests who led a life of asceticism and poverty. He condemned the\n    clergy of the day for their love of wealth and power.28 </li>\n  <li>The <i><b>Adamists </b></i>conducted their worship in the nude.29 </li>\n  <li><i><b>Arnold of Brescia</b></i>. . .was earnestly eager to see the Church conform fully\n    to the Christian ideal. Believing that this could not be so long as its leaders\n    compromised with the world, he attacked the bishops for their cupidity, dishonest gains,\n    and frequent irregularity of life and urged that the clergy renounce all property and\n    political and physical power. . .in 1155 he was hanged, his body was burned, and his ashes\n    were thrown into the Tiber. . . .30 </li>\n  <li>In Northern Italy, \". . .the \"<i><b>Pataria</b></i>\" had some years\n    earlier grown up spontaneously in reaction to an increasing corrupt and politically\n    oriented clergy.\" They were apparently the descendants of the <i><b>Bogomils</b></i>,\n    who in turn grew out of the dualistic \"<i><b>Paulicians</b></i>\".31 </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In addition to these were numerous lesser movements, of which Latourette admits,\n\"We shall probably never learn even the names of all of them.\"32 </p>\n\n<p>Even this short list demonstrates that there were questions being asked at this time,\nmany of which are strikingly similar to those issues raised by the Poor of Lyons: \n\n</p><ul>\n  <li>the question of poverty and asceticism as a means of growth and/or salvation, </li>\n  <li>questions about the role of ritual, </li>\n  <li>activism of various sorts among the laity, </li>\n  <li>questions about the integrity of the clergy. </li>\n  <li>questions about interpretation and application of the Bible.33 </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It is likely that Waldo and his followers were influenced by some of these movements,\nalthough it is not clear how much. It would be too coincidental to see such common themes\narising apart from any influence whatever. The fact is that there was a cultural and\nreligious milieu shaping the thinking of this movement. </p>\n\n<p>For example, we can place Lyonese poor nuclei in the same area of France as the <i>Cathari</i>,\nat a time when the Catharite revolution was at its height.34 Also, both southern France\nand northern Italy were hot-beds of dissident zeal during the very period of the rise of\nthe Waldensians. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the Neo-Platonic and dualistic aspects of so many of these groups is\nnot as evident in the teachings of the Waldensians during the earliest period. There is\nundoubtedly some platonic asceticism involved in Waldo' renunciation of wealth. Many of\nthe new groups, including the mendicant orders of monks were renouncing all wealth at this\ntime, and traveling around as beggars and preachers.35 </p>\n\n<p>It is important to realize that the reason they did so was not in order to relieve\npoverty through a more equitable distribution of goods, but because the suffering incurred\nfrom being poor was good for the soul. The material world was viewed with suspicion, and\nanything that served to separate one from it would bring him/her closer to the Spiritual\nworld, that is, closer to God.36 </p>\n\n<p>Significantly, shortly after the time of Waldo, Boanaventure would argue that poverty\nhad been Christ's pattern, carried on for some time by monks such as the Egyptian\nanchorites, \"but poverty declined after the Donation of Constantine and was not\nrevived until the thirteenth century with the foundation of religious mendicancy by\nFrancis and Dominic.\" This view of history was identical to that held by the\nWaldensians.37 </p>\n\n<p>Tourn and others argue that this ascetic ideological base was not the case with the\nWaldensians. Their basis for renunciation of wealth was a literalistic application of Lk.\n9:3-6, and Mk. 10:23-27, which are not ascetic. In other words, \". . .one might say\nthat Waldensian piety was eschatological rather than dualist or ascetic.\"38 </p>\n\n<p>This may be partially true for another reason. We find no reference to the monastic\nliterature anywhere in the early Waldensian literature. The Cistercian order, which had\nbeen organized around 1119 believed that, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>. . .the rule (of St. Benedict) was not merely a guideline or a set of positive laws\n  which can be dispensed, but rather a species of Divine Law, which like the Commandments of\n  the Gospel, has to be interpreted, but cannot be changed or dispensed.39 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This point of view, so typical of all of the orders at this time, is absent from early\nWaldensian thinking. They based their movement of the authority of the scriptures.40 </p>\n\n<p>Another distinction between the Waldensians and the monastic idealists at this time was\nthe outward focus of the Poor of Lyons. They were not seeking primarily inner piety, but\naggressive outreach to others. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\". . .Waldo's case was different [than most poverty enthusiasts]. His vow did not\n  lead him to a monastery and to a life of contemplation and obedience. He was an ordinary\n  citizen among the poor and was determined to remain so. . .41 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"For the Poor the bond of unity lay not in the sacraments but in their apostolic\n  mission. Christian virtue, then, was in demonstrating love, and care for the brethren. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Everyone of them, old and young, men and women, by day and by night, do not stop\n  their learning and teaching of others.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>An inquisitor quotes, in the same vein, one of the Poor who had been brought before\nhim: \"In our home, women teach as well as men, and one who has been a student for a\nweek teaches another.\" 42 </p>\n\n<p>Thus the Waldensians were more activistic and outreaching than sacramental or\nreflective.43</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Waldensians Compared to Fransciscans</h3>\n\n<p>Perhaps if there had been more dependence on monastic ideology the later history of the\nWaldensians would have been very different. Not long after the time of Waldo, another new\norder arose not far from the region of Lombardy under the leadership of Francis of Assisi.\nThe similarities between these groups is quite striking. </p>\n\n<p>Both were operating in the same area at about the same time. Francis was also untrained\nin theology. His followers, like the Waldensians, were unlearned. They lived in voluntary\npoverty, dressing in course cloth and sandals--exactly like the Waldensians. They traveled\naround sometimes and preached, as the Waldensians did, although the emphasis with the\nFranciscans was more on service while that of the Waldensians was more on preaching. Both\nwere critical of the Roman Church's failure to fully live up to the ideals of Scripture.\nBoth went to Rome to obtain papal approval for their orders. And this is where the\nsimilarity stops. </p>\n\n<p>Francis did obtain approval from the Pope, while Waldo did not.44 Thus the Franciscans\nwere taken into the embrace of the Church. This exempted them from persecution for the\ntime being, and in fact, Franciscans were often leaders of the persecution of the\nWaldensians. </p>\n\n<p>The question of the relationship of the Waldensians to the other doctrinal currents of\nthat time is hard to determine exactly. There is no evidence of any influence from other\ngroups on Waldo himself, until after his condemnation. Earlier, for instance, he directly\ndenounced the Albigensians' doctrine.45 </p>\n\n<p>The most important point in this is that there was no ideological or theological\nbreakthrough that occasioned the Waldensian movement.46 Their existence was not the result\nof any change in theology, but rather a change in theopraxy--the Poor of Lyons translated\nthe Bible, and preached it in their own words.47 Thus, the Waldensians are an early test\ncase in the area of lay ministry. Their main sin was to take too literally the Biblical\ncommand to, \". . .teach them to observe all that I commanded you.\" </p>\n\n<p>Not only did they refuse to deny the right of the laity to preach and teach, they also\nallowed and encouraged women to teach. This had tremendous shock effect on their culture,\nat the same time that it probably tapped an hitherto unknown source of power.48 It would\nbe easy to underestimate the impact that this feature had on the Europe of 1170. </p>\n\n<p>It was after their excommunication that the Poor of Lyons' doctrine became\nobjectionable to the Roman Catholic Church. More than a hundred years later, it was said, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Among all the sects, there is none more pernicious to the Church than that of the\n  leonists, and for three reasons: </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>In the first place, because it is one of the most ancient; for some say that it dates\n    back to the time of Sylvester; others to the time of the Apostles. </li>\n  <li>In the second place, because it is the most widespread. There is hardly a country where\n    it does not exist. </li>\n  <li>In the third place, because, if other sects strike with horror those who listen to them,\n    the Leonists, on the contrary, possess a great outward appearance of piety. As a matter of\n    fact they lead irreproachable lives before men, and as regards their faith and the\n    articles of their creed, they are orthodox. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Their one conspicuous fault is, that they blaspheme against the Church and the clergy,\n  points on which laymen in general are known to be too easily led away.49 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/waldo1.htm\">Go back to the Waldensian table of contents</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/chhist.htm\">Go back to the Church History page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/waldo5.htm\">Read on to the next section in \"Waldensians\"</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Go back to the Xenos home page</a> \n\n</p><dl>\n  <dt><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=waldensian\">Ask\n    Dennis a question or share a comment.</a> </dt>\n</dl>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Waldensian Movement From Waldo to the Reformation III","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/waldo4.htm"}

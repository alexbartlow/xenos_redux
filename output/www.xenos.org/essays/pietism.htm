Specifically, the teaching of Johann Arndt, Philip Jacob\nSpener and August Hermann Francke will be studied. Three specific areas of their view of\njustification will be examined: the basis of justification, the relationship between\njustification and sanctification, and the role of baptism in justification. </p>\n\n<p>An effort has been made to identify and study the primary sources of each of the above\nPietists in these doctrinal areas. Direct quotation of their works accompany and\nsubstantiate any assertion concerning their teaching. Secondary sources have also been\nevaluated for additional interaction in the interpretation of the primary sources.</p>\n\n<p>Consideration has also been given to the theological and political climate of\nProtestantism during the seventeenth century. This has been done in order to assure\nfairness in evaluating the doctrinal emphases of the Pietists. </p>\n\n\n<p>The Background of German Pietism</p>\n\n\n<p>Like all religious movements, German Pietism was, at least in part, a reaction to the\nspiritual and political climate of its day. Any attempt to understand the theological\nemphases of Arndt, Spener and Francke must therefore be preceded by an overview of the\nreligious and political climate in which they lived.</p>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>The Religious Situation</p>\n\n\n<p>The most important factor in German Lutheranism just prior to the emergence of Pietism\nwas its rigid confessionalism, or <i>Verkonfessionalisierung</i>.</p>\n\n<p>After Luther died in 1546, Lutheran scholars tried to precisely formulate the doctrines\nof the Christian faith as they understood them. This was felt to be necessary since the\nLutherans were experiencing acute doctrinal pressure from both aggressive Calvinists and\nJesuit Catholics.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote1B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote1A\">Footnote1</a> Two camps\ndeveloped within Lutheranism: the \"Philippists\", who, following the example of\nLuther's mentor Philip Melanchthon, emphasized the common doctrinal ground that they\nshared with the Calvinists, and the \"Gnesio-Lutherans\", who held rigidly to\nLuther's main tenets and regarded all other groups with suspicion. It was the\nGnesio-Lutherans who won out in this struggle for ascendancy.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote2B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote2A\">Footnote2</a> The Formula of Concord of 1580 formally resolved the\ndoctrinal disputes within Lutheranism.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote3B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote3A\">Footnote3</a></p>\n\n<p>With its center at the University of Wittenberg<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote4B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote4A\">Footnote4</a>, the same school from which Luther launched the\nReformation, Lutheranism lapsed into a rigid orthodoxy and sterile scholasticism.\nIronically, though Luther had unseated Thomist scholasticism from its throne of power over\ntheology, the Lutheran scholars of this period consciously reintroduced it in order to\nformulate their doctrinal statements.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote5B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote5A\">Footnote5</a>\nThe University of Wittenberg declared that the resulting creedal formulations of\nLutheranism \"possessed the force of divinely revealed and binding truth, not only in\nmatters of doctrine, but in all affairs.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote6B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote6A\">Footnote6</a></p>\n\n<p>This defensive, heavily dogmatic emphasis produced Lutheran Confessionalism--a dead\northodoxy that Luther would hardly have desired. Stoeffler describes this confessionalism\nand its effects on how people came to view Christianity.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It (<i>Verkonfessionalisierung</i>) refers to the rigid confessionalizing of\n  Lutheranism which was undertaken by its seventeenth century theologians. The process was\n  aided by the reappearance of Aristotelianism in German universities and gymnasia early\n  during that century. The result was an unprecedented hardening of Lutheran doctrine. Not\n  only did the guardians of orthodoxy endeavor to keep pure the teachings of the communion\n  but the truth had to be stated in accepted phrases. Any deviation in phraseology was\n  immediately viewed with great suspicion. After John Gerhard the various minutiae of the\n  seventeenth century systems of Lutheran theology had to be treated in proper order and\n  sequence so as not to raise apprehensions of heresy. In this heavily dogmatic atmosphere\n  the essence of Christianity came to be regarded as consisting in a series of rationally\n  ordered propositions. Faith had been largely re-defined so as to consist in personal\n  assent to those propositions. Confessional theology and Christianity were regarded as\n  almost synonymous.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote7B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote7A\">Footnote7</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Brown is similarly critical in his evaluation of Lutheran Confessionalism, viewing it\nas a virtual reversal of the Reformation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Negatively, some have felt that in Protestant Scholasticism we have an\n  \"intellectual Pelegianism\" in which the good works of the medieval church were\n  exchanged for the works of understanding. Aristotle, who had been thrown out the front\n  door, quickly came in the back. Justification by faith became one of the dogmas instead of\n  the source of dogma. Luther's God, who was a Thou, became an It. The testimony of the Holy\n  Spirit became a mere intellectual process of increasing acquaintance with the truth.\n  Though there was an apotheosis of the Bible, the Scriptures were used primarily as proof\n  texts to verify the creedal dogmas.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote8B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote8A\">Footnote8</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Spener, writing in <i>Pia Desideria</i>, similarly complained about the scholasticism\nof Lutheran Confessionalism:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Although by God's grace we still have pure doctrine derived from the Word of God, we\n  cannot deny that much that is alien, useless, and reminiscent of the world's wisdom has\n  here and there been gradually introduced into theology.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote9B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote9A\">Footnote9</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since the pastors were being educated in this spiritual climate, it is not surprising\nthat their preaching consisted mainly of dogmatic expositions of Lutheran doctrine and\npolemical denunciations of Catholicism and Calvinism, rather than applied scripture which\nwould build up the spiritual life of their congregations.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote10B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote10A\">Footnote10</a></p>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>The Political Situation</p>\n\n\n<p>The spiritual unhealthy of late sixteenth century Germany was further aggravated by the\npolitical situation. Two factors in the political situation helped stir the spiritual\nhunger of the people who responded to the Pietists' message.</p>\n\n\n<p>The Thirty Years War</p>\n\n\n<p>The Thirty Years War lasted from 1609 until 1637, although the Peace of Westphalia\nwhich formally ended the war was not signed until 1648.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote11B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote11A\">Footnote11</a> This war, fought largely because of the religious\nintolerance between Catholic and Protestant rulers, devastated Europe worse than any other\nwar before the twentieth century. </p>\n\n<p>The war ended without any genuine resolution. The rulers simply wearied of the\nbloodshed and economic loss caused by it. The Peace of Westphalia granted to both rulers\nand subjects \"freedom of religion\"--as long as they were Catholic, Lutheran or\nReformed. Although this increased religious tolerance was an improvement, it was not\npromulgated by the political rulers \"out of a deeper understanding of Christian love,\nbut rather out of a growing indifference to religious matters.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote12B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote12A\">Footnote12</a></p>\n\n<p>This same indifference spread to the common people, whose lives were devastated by the\nwar. The war had the effect of weakening the people's moral fiber. Cruelty and drunkenness\nbecame commonplace among the peasants. Their spiritual malaise was further aggravated by\nthe ruthless and uninhibited behavior of both rulers and soldiers.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote13B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote13A\">Footnote13</a> \"The seemingly interminable war raised religious\ndoubts among the laity and generated indifference to moral and spiritual matters.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote14B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote14A\">Footnote14</a></p>\n\n\n<p>The German State-Church Relationship</p>\n\n\n<p>For a variety of reasons which lie outside the scope of this project, Luther did not\nsever the state's control over the church at the time of the Reformation. This wedding of\nchurch and state had a damaging effect on the spiritual health of German Lutherans for two\nreasons.</p>\n\n<p>First, with the church and state under common jurisdiction, the church's power to\nexercise discipline with its members was limited by the agreement of the state rulers. As\nStoeffler says,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Under the circumstances no presbyterial element had an opportunity to develop within\n  Lutheranism. In most instances the churches and clergy were at the mercy of territorial\n  rulers, the latter being often dissolute and seldom devout. Even if Lutheranism had\n  developed a concept of church discipline, which it did not, effective discipline would\n  have been difficult under these conditions.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote15B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote15A\">Footnote15</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since church discipline is one of the means Christ provided to maintain the church's\nspiritual vitality<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote16B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote16A\">Footnote16</a>, its\nabsence from German Lutheranism left the church much more vulnerable to spiritual decay.</p>\n\n<p>A state-run church tends to lower the collective spirituality of the church in another\nway. Since everyone is supposedly a Christian in a state which is \"Christian,\"\nthe society does not tend to rise to the ethical or spiritual quality of the church.\nRather, the church tends to conform to the society. This was certainly the case in\nseventeenth century Germany.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote17B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote17A\">Footnote17</a></p>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>The Resultant Nominalism</p>\n\n\n<p>The factors described above combined in German Lutheranism in the seventeenth century\nto produce a form of Christianity which was nominal both in practice and in doctrine. </p>\n\n<p>Confessional Lutheranism was doctrinally nominal because it defined being a Christian\nalmost exclusively in terms of mental affirmation of Lutheran dogma.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote18B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote18A\">Footnote18</a> Nicolaus Amsdorf, a theologian of this period, even went\nso far as to teach that good works were hurtful to the Christian life since they could\nfoster a doctrine of justification by works!<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote19B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote19A\">Footnote19</a> Stoeffler describes this doctrinal nominalism:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When their rigidly objective interpretation of justification was joined to an equally\n  objective interpretation of baptismal regeneration the centrality of the saving\n  relationship was rather effectively eliminated from seventeenth century Lutheran\n  orthodoxy. The Christian was now thought to be a person who interprets the Bible in terms\n  of the Lutheran symbols as the truth of these symbols is expressed in an orthodox system\n  of theology. <cite>Fiducia</cite> had become <cite>assensus</cite>, the liberty of the\n  Christian man had given way to the tyranny of scholastic theology, and the Bible had once\n  again become an arsenal of proof texts.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote20B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote20A\">Footnote20</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This gross distortion of the theology of Paul and (to a lesser extent) Luther had the\npredictable effect of producing a behavioral nominalism that was worse than that of other\npost-Reformation Protestant churches. The laity had little appreciation of Christianity as\na way of life as well as a series of doctrinal beliefs.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote21B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote21A\">Footnote21</a> Though the churches were well attended, there was little\nevidence of ethical transformation which was encouraged and manifested in the New\nTestament church. Personal spiritual devotion was replaced by superficial and mechanical\nreligious observance<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote22B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote22A\">Footnote22</a> which\nGod, speaking through the Old Testament prophets, says He hates.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote23B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote23A\">Footnote23</a> In Arndt, Spener and Francke, a similar prophetic voice\nwas sounded.</p>\n\n\n<p>Early Lutheran Pietis<cite>ts</cite></p>\n\n\n<p>Johann Arndt (1555-1621) has been widely acknowledged as the theological father of\nGerman Lutheran Pietism.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote24B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote24A\">Footnote24</a> As\na Lutheran pastor and a scholar of Luther's writings, his <i>True Christianity</i> (1605)\nwas the first German Pietist work to challenge the spiritual maladies of Lutheran\northodoxy.</p>\n\n<p>Philip Jacob Spener (1635-1705) is credited with forging the ideas of Arndt into a\nreform movement within Lutheranism.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote25B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote25A\">Footnote25</a>\nLike Arndt, he was a Lutheran pastor and scholar. He was deeply influenced by <i>True\nChristianity</i>, and in 1675, he wrote a foreword to a new edition of <i>True\nChristianity</i>. This foreword, reissued separately a year later, was entitled <i>Pia\nDesideria, or Heartfelt Desire for a God-pleasing Reform of the True Evangelical Church,\nTogether with Several Simple Christian Proposals Looking Toward this End</i>. As the title\nsuggests, this work not only critiqued the spiritual state of German Lutheranism; it also\noutlined a plan of reform. It was greeted with an enthusiastic response by many German\npeople, but with sharp criticism by much of the the clergy. In his subsequent works,\nSpener continued to outline the needed reform of the Lutheran church.</p>\n\n<p>August Hermann Francke (1663-1727) was Spener's disciple and friend. As a Lutheran\npastor, he found himself in conflict with other Lutheran clergymen after undergoing a\nprofound conversion experience. As a result of Spener's influence, Francke was invited to\nbecome professor of Greek and Oriental languages at the newly formed University of Halle.\nUnder his leadership, Halle became a key means of Pietist reform as it trained men for the\nLutheran pastorate who were taught the theology and practice of Arndt, Spener and Francke.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote26B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote26A\">Footnote26</a></p>\n\n\n<p>The Basis of Justification</p>\n\n\n<p>The critical rediscovery of Luther and the Reformers was the doctrine of justification\nby grace through faith alone. God legally cancels the debt of our sins and imputes\nChrist's righteousness to us when we place our faith in Christ and His work on the cross\nto make us acceptable to God. Arndt, Spener and Francke completely agreed with this\ndoctrine. Their impact was the result not of a different view of justification, but of a\ndifferent definition of the faith that effects justification.</p>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Justification by Faith Alone</p>\n\n\n<p>Many Lutheran Confessionalists accused Arndt, Spener and Francke of teaching\njustification by works, or of confusing justification with sanctification.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote27B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote27A\">Footnote27</a> However, an examination of\ntheir writings proves that all three men believed that justification is by grace through\nfaith alone, and that justification must precede sanctification.</p>\n\n<p>Because Arndt was aware of the accusations leveled at him, he went out of his way to\nstate his Lutheran orthodoxy in this area of theology. The following quotes clearly reveal\nArndt's view of justification.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You must take care that you do not connect your works and the virtues that you have\n  begun, or the gifts of the new life, with your justification before God, for none of man's\n  works, merit, gifts, or virtue, however lovely these may be, count for anything. Our\n  justification depends on the exalted, perfect merit of Jesus Christ, received by faith, as\n  it is sufficiently discussed in chapters 5, 19, 34, and 41 of this book, and in the first\n  three chapters of Book II. Take great care, therefore, not to confound the righteousness\n  of faith with the righteousness of the Christian life, but make a clear distinction\n  between them&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote28B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote28A\">Footnote28</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Through this faith (in Christ) we receive forgiveness of sins, in no other way than\n  through pure grace without any of our own merits (Eph. 2:8) but only by the merits of\n  Christ&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;Even if it (our faith) is weak and we are still hemmed\n  around with many sins, these are covered over out of grace for Christ's\n  sake&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;From this you can see that works cannot make you righteous.\n  First, you must be established in Christ through faith and be righteous in him before you\n  can do any good work. See to it indeed that your righteousness is the grace and gift of\n  God that comes before all your merit.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote29B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote29A\">Footnote29</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In like manner, Spener clarified to his accusers the orthodoxy of his view of\njustification. Three passages will suffice to demonstrate this.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We gladly acknowledge that we must be saved only and alone through faith and that our\n  works or godly life contribute neither much nor little to our salvation, for as a fruit of\n  our faith our works are connected with the gratitude which we owe to God, who has already\n  given us who believe the gift of righteousness and salvation. Far be it from us to depart\n  even a finger's breadth from this teaching, for we would rather give up our life and the\n  whole world than yield the smallest part of it.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote30B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote30A\">Footnote30</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I know, believe and teach that as far as our justification is concerned, it takes place\n  out of pure grace for the sake of Christ and is not in the least reflected directly or\n  indirectly by our holiness or righteousness. If anyone should endeavor to mix anything of\n  human worthiness, I would oppose that person from the bottom of my\n  soul&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;none of our works or merits avail anything but only the\n  merits of Christ, not what He has done in us but for us by Him. When we say that faith\n  saves, I understand that such saving is not a work of faith as if it were a virtue that we\n  possessed and therefore belong among works but that one receives justification only by\n  God's grace and Christ's merit alone.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote31B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote31A\">Footnote31</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Ought we not also bring such sacrifices (ourselves and our good works) to God the\n  Lord in order to make atonement for our sins?</p></blockquote></i>\" No, for Christ alone has made\n  satisfaction for us by his sacrifice, and he who wishes to add to it his own sacrifice for\n  atonement blasphemes the sacrifice of Christ (Heb. 10:14).<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote32B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote32A\">Footnote32</a>\n\n\n<p>Francke also clearly stated his theology of justification in terms designed to disprove\nall charges of heresy.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1. We are justified only by faith in the Lord Jesus without merit or the addition of\n  work in that the Heavenly Father because of the perfect satisfaction and the precious\n  merit of his Son judges us free and liberated from all our sins.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2. Through this justification, which occurs through faith, the justified person becomes\n  completely and totally perfect; indeed, it is seen as the justification of God himself, as\n  St. Paul writes: God made him who knew no sin to be sin for us that we might become the\n  justification of God (2 Cor. 5:21). Just as God looks on the Lord Christ as sin (because\n  our sins were reckoned to him), so he sees the sinner as just and completely perfect\n  because he gives to the sinner as the sinner's own the innocence and righteousness of\n  Christ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>3. He who does not have this perfection cannot become holy. Perfection is nothing other\n  than faith in the Lord Jesus and is not in us or ours but in Christ or of Christ for whose\n  sake we are considered perfect before God and thus his perfection is ours by\n  ascription&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>10. From this it follows that both the following statements are true in a certain\n  sense: We are perfect, and we are not perfect. Namely, we are perfect through Christ and\n  in Christ through our justification and according to the righteousness of Christ ascribed\n  to us. However, we are not and will not be completely perfect in the sense that we will\n  nevermore be able to grow, to set aside evil and to take on good toward sanctification.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>11. The one who does not wish to err in this matter must distinguish well the article\n  concerning justification and that concerning renovation or sanctification. Otherwise he\n  will increasingly become entangled in controversy.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote33B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote33A\">Footnote33</a>&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;God\n  having thus received me into his grace by faith in his son Jesus, I am not at one time\n  justified and at another time not: but I am always and constantly in God's\n  favor&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote34B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote34A\">Footnote34</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>Faith as <i>Fiducia</i></p>\n\n\n<p>One of the the key contributions of the Pietists to Protestantism's view of\njustification was its insistence that justifying faith is<cite> </cite><i>fiducia</i>\nrather than <i>assensus</i>. </p>\n\n<p>The Pietists insisted that biblical faith is more than merely mentally assenting to\ndoctrinal truths (<i>assensus</i>); it is a personal faith (<i>fiducia</i>) which lays\nhold of the life of Christ and therefore results in regeneration and sanctification. To\nprove that this definition of faith was no doctrinal innovation, Spener was fond of\nquoting Luther's \"Preface to Romans, \" where he says,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But it (unbiblical faith) is a human imagination an idea that never reaches the depths\n  of the heart, and so nothing comes of it and no betterment follows it. Faith, however, is\n  a divine work in us. It changes us and makes us to be born anew of God (John 1:13). It\n  kills the old Adam and makes altogether different men of us in heart and spirit and mind\n  and powers, and it brings with it the Holy Spirit. O, it is a living, busy, active, mighty\n  thing, this faith, and it is impossible for it not to do good works incessantly. It does\n  not ask whether there are good works to do, but before the question rises it has already\n  done them and is always at the doing of them&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote35B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote35A\">Footnote35</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Luther did not develop or emphasize this dimension of faith because his primary battle\nwas against the works soteriology of Roman Catholicism. But the Pietists <i>did</i>\ndevelop and emphasize it because their battle was against the dead orthodoxy of\nConfessional Lutheranism.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote36B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote36A\">Footnote36</a>\nThis passage from Luther thus became a key part of their defense that they were not\noverturning the Reformation, but merely continuing it.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote37B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote37A\">Footnote37</a></p>\n\n<p>Arndt develops this view of faith as one of his main themes in <i>True Christianity</i>.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote38B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote38A\">Footnote38</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>True Christianity consists, not in words or in external show, but in living faith, from\n  which arise righteous fruits, and all manner of Christian virtues, as from Christ himself.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote39B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote39A\">Footnote39</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note that faith consists in living, consoling trust and not in empty sounds and\n  words&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;This is true knowledge of God, which arises out of\n  experience and consists in living faith. Therefore, the Epistle to the Hebrews calls faith\n  a substance, a being, an undeniable witness (Heb. 11:1). This is a piece of the inner,\n  spiritual worship, the knowledge of God, which consists in living faith, and faith is a\n  spiritual, living, heavenly gift, light and power of God.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote40B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote40A\">Footnote40</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the living and working faith and in the following of the holy life of Christ, the\n  true living knowledge of Christ consists.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote41B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote41A\">Footnote41</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Spener stresses the personal and experiential dimension of biblical faith in\n\"Christian Joy.\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The basis of joy (is) the assurance of divine grace.

As has already been shown,\nthey held that mental assent to the creedal statements was sufficient. With such a\nperspective typically comes a corresponding belief in ritual as efficacious in itself.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote79B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote79A\">Footnote79</a> Thus, it was commonly assumed\nthat unless someone expressly denied Christ, they had \"faith\" in Christ and thus\nremained in the state of baptismal grace conferred upon them as an infant. For all intents\nand purposes then, many Germans believed that they permanently entered a state of grace at\ninfant baptism.</p>\n\n<p>While the German Pietists did not reject the Lutheran doctrine of baptism, they\nreaffirmed that it could not<cite> </cite><i>keep</i> a person in a state of grace unless\nthat individual came to <i>personal</i> faith in Christ. By emphasizing the personal\nnature of saving faith and the moral change by which it was evidenced, they rejected the\nvalidity of mental assent faith. This in turn led them to warn against depending upon the\nabiding efficacy of infant baptism. They saw this negative emphasis as necessary in order\nto call people to genuine faith; one's false security in baptism must often first be\ndestroyed before one will come to true saving faith.</p>\n\n<p>In <i>True Christianity</i>, Arndt does not expressly state that infant baptism must be\ncoupled with personal faith in order to stay in a state of grace. Rather, one reaches this\nconclusion as a logical inference by his emphasis on the nature of saving faith and its\nnecessity. As Stoeffler says, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;Arndt held the historic Lutheran view of baptism. In\n  point of fact, however, he said little about it and put the emphasis on conversion,\n  oneness with Christ, and a holy life.\" <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote80B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote80A\">Footnote80</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What was a logical inference from Arndt became an open declaration with Spener. Two\nstatements from <i>Pia Desideria</i> make this clear.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Just as the above illusion of faith as the only means of salvation from our side does\n  great harm, so from the side of the divine means of Word and sacraments the shameful\n  illusion of an <i>opus operatum</i> is added. This is not less harmful to the church,\n  leads many people to damnation, and strengthens the aforementioned false notion of what\n  true faith is. We cannot deny--on the contrary, daily experience convinces us--that there\n  are not a few who think that all that Christianity requires of them (and that having done\n  this, they have done quite enough in their service of God) is that they be baptized, hear\n  the preaching of God's Word, confess and receive absolution, and go to the Lord's Supper,\n  no matter how their hearts are disposed at the time, whether or not there are fruits which\n  follow, provided they at least live in such a way that the civil authorities do not find\n  them liable to punishment&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;It (baptism) will be in vain that you\n  comfort yourself in your Baptism and in its promise of grace and salvation if for your\n  part you do not also remain in the covenant of faith and a good conscience or, having\n  departed therefrom, return to it with sincere repentance. Accordingly if your Baptism is\n  to benefit you, it must remain in constant use throughout your life.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote81B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote81A\">Footnote81</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Nor is it enough to be baptized, but the inner man, where we have put on Christ in\n  Baptism, must also keep Christ on and bear witness to him in our outward life.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote82B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote82A\">Footnote82</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Francke continued Spener's emphasis on the uselessness of baptism unless it was\naccompanied by personal faith.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thus you ought not to say, \"I am baptized, I go to church, I am a Christian.\"\n  The hypocrites do the same. There is many a person baptized who yet went back on his oath\n  and was faithless and fell out of his baptismal covenant&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;You\n  must make no decisions (about whether you are justified) because you follow externals\n  (i.e. baptism, church attendance, communion). The Scripture is directed to your heart and\n  indicates how you must find proper certainty and be sealed by the Spirit of God. You must\n  receive the Spirit of God from God and from it you must know how richly you are graced by\n  God. See, there you are commanded, there you might know what happens in the heart of God\n  for your sake, whether God loves you, whether you are his child.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote83B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote83A\">Footnote83</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Evaluation</p>\n\n<p>Arndt, Spener and Francke held an orthodox Lutheran view of baptism. They saw baptism\nas a means of prevenient grace which must be confirmed in adult life by personal faith in\nChrist in order to have permanent validity. They disagreed, however, with both the\nConfessionalists' and the common people's view of baptism who essentially viewed it as a\npermanent entrance into grace. They struggled to maintain the Lutheran view of baptism\nwhile stressing the supreme importance of personal faith in Christ as the sole assurance\nof salvation.</p>\n\n<p>It is the opinion of this writer that Arndt, Spener and Francke were struggling with a\nLutheran doctrine which was logically contradictory and biblically unnecessary. </p>\n\n<p>There is an inherent logical tension in the Lutheran doctrine on baptism which Arndt,\nSpener and Francke inherited. On the one hand, Lutheran doctrine affirms that baptism\neffects an objective change in the infant's standing with God, placing the infant in the\nsphere of God's grace. On the other hand, it affirms the necessity of exercising faith in\nChrist in order to be justified. Many have noted the difficulty of understanding why faith\nis necessary if baptism places one under grace, or why baptism is effective if faith is\nwhat justifies.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote84B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote84A\">Footnote84</a></p>\n\n<p>It is evident from the writings of both Luther and the Lutheran Pietists that the\nsource of this \"tension\" is their interpretation of several New Testament\npassages which teach that \"baptism\" objectively changes our relationship with\nGod.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote85B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote85A\">Footnote85</a> It appears that\nneither Luther nor the Lutheran Pietists ever seriously questioned the Roman Catholic\ninterpretation of these passages as referring to Christian water baptism. If it is granted\nthat these passages refer instead to the baptism by the Holy Spirit into Christ (I Cor.\n12:13), an invisible event which occurs at the moment of faith (Eph. 1:13,14), the\napparent biblical and logical \"contradiction\" disappears. Water baptism is then\nunderstood as an outward affirmation of what has already taken place at the moment of\npersonal faith in Christ (see Acts 10:44-47).</p>\n\n<p>Rather than challenge the Lutheran doctrine of baptism, the Lutheran Pietists simply\nemphasized the necessity of coupling baptism with personal faith. But the tension inherent\nin Lutheran baptismal doctrine was such that many later Pietists wrestled with their views\nof baptism.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote86B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote86A\">Footnote86</a> The adoption of\nbelievers-only baptism became one of the distinctives of the Radical Pietists.</p>\n\n\n<p>Conclusion</p>\n\n\n<p>Arndt, Spener and Francke were in agreement with Luther and Lutheran orthodoxy that\njustification is a gift of legal righteousness received by faith alone. </p>\n\n<p>They were insistent that the faith that justifies is a living, personal faith (<i>fiducia</i>)\nrather than a barren mental assent to orthodox creeds (<i>assensus</i>). In this area,\nthey were more in keeping with the teaching of Luther than their Confessionalist\ncontemporaries, though admittedly Luther did not develop this theme to a great degree. </p>\n\n<p>Arndt, Spener and Francke were also in agreement with Luther and Lutheran orthodoxy\nabout the meaning of baptism as a means of prevenient grace which must be later confirmed\nby personal faith. But their emphasis on <i>fiducia</i> as necessary for justification led\nthem to decry the false confidence that many Germans had placed in their baptism as an <i>ex\noper operato</i> rite.</p>\n\n<p>From their insistence on living faith, they concluded logically, biblically and\nexperientially that sanctification will follow and give evidence of justification. It was\nthis position that called forth from their Confessionalist contemporaries the charge that\nthey were overturning the Reformation by reintroducing works as a condition for\njustification. </p>\n\n<p>Throughout their lives, Arndt, Spener and Francke consistently denied that they were\noverturning the doctrine of the Reformation. They did not even claim to be\n\"completing\" the Reformation that Luther began, though some have charged that\nthey did. Rather, they saw themselves as a reform movement within Lutheranism, calling for\na return to the spiritual dynamic between justification and sanctification that they read\nin scripture and in Luther, and that they had experienced in their own lives.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pietism.htm#Footnote87B\"></a><a name=\"Footnote87A\">Footnote87</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\">Return to the Essays page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to the Xenos home page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:DeLashmuttG@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Ask Gary a question or\nshare a comment.</a> </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Arndt, Johann. <i>The Garden of Paradise</i>.

Sources of Morality Knowledge</h3>\n\n<p>The source for Christian ethics is God. To the extent that we are able to understand\nHim and His nature, we will have a clear basis for all types of morality. However, before\nending the paper, there are other considerations to cover. </p>\n\n<p>The main sticking point here has to do with how we may know God. To this I answer that\nwe may know God through two means-- natural or general revelation, and special revelation.\nSubsequently, we will have to ask also how that knowledge should be translated into moral\nunderstanding. This latter question becomes a discussion of hermeneutics. </p>\n\n<h3>A. Natural Revelation</h3>\n\n<p>According to Paul, there are things that can be known about God from, \"that which\nhas been made\". Such insight includes knowledge of God's, \"invisible attributes\nand divine nature.\" Furthermore, these things are \"clearly seen\". (Rom.\n1:20) This testimony is echoed elsewhere in the Bible as well.1 </p>\n\n<p>Finally, Paul says that God has made these same things \"evident within\" all\nmen. Thus, even one who was physically blind would still have recognizable features of his\nown make up that would suggest not only the existence of God, but key aspects of His\nnature as well.2 Therefore, man is \"without excuse\", and will be judged\naccording to that law which is \"written on their hearts,\" (Rom. 1:20;2:15). </p>\n\n<p>These passages along with several parallels lay the basis for the idea of \"natural\nlaw\". Natural law is that portion of true morality that can be deduced from the basic\nfeatures of the created order, and our own personalities.3 </p>\n\n<p>It is the position of most pre-millennial thinkers that natural law is an adequate\nbasis for societal law making.4 I would agree. Limiting legislation to instituting laws\nthat are in harmony with natural law has distinct advantages. It leaves the maximum amount\nof personal freedom, while safeguarding the basic rights of the weak and the minorities.\nIt also permits the existence of a pluralistic society, unlike a society which attempts to\npattern itself on the Old Testament civil law. Finally, it does not need to confuse the\nclear distinctions between the old and new covenants. As Kaye (who speaks from a reformed\nperspective) admits, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...one is forced to say that the New Testament contains no consideration of the\n  ordering of society as a question in its own right. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And in his conclusion says, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...the New Testament gives us no direct answer to the question of how society should be\n  ordered.5 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This being the case, those who would find a biblical basis for ordering society\ninvariably end up in the Old Testament, adducing principles that are not applicable to the\ncurrent situation.6 It is better to base societal laws on natural law, which in turn is\nbased on general revelation. </p>\n\n<h3>B. Special Revelation</h3>\n\n<p>When turning to the Bible itself, we are able to go further in the area of ethics.\nInstead of only devising laws for society, we can begin to speak of a fuller morality that\nis suitable for the lives of those who admit that they follow Christ. </p>\n\n<p>Within the Bible, this author is convinced that there are fundamental differences\nbetween the Old Testament and the New Testament which must be born carefully in mind. On\nthe other hand, it is the nature of God Himself that ultimately forms the basis for all\nmorality, and He has not changed at all. This means that it is necessary for the\ninterpreter to determine whether a given passage embodying rules for behavior is\nreflecting the nature of God, or a special situation or covenant which may or may not\ndirectly apply today. This question will be examined further in the next section. </p>\n\n<p>At this point it is necessary to respond to claims made by some that other sources can\nbe avenues of knowing God and morality. Particularly, other religious authorities past and\npresent, or perhaps, the flow of history. </p>\n\n<p>It is the view of this author that there can only be one final source of special\nrevelation. In the end, all other truth claims will be judged by that source, or, there\nwill be an inability to judge at all, leading either to some form of relativism, or\narbitrary moral authority. On this point, I would find that Longenecker's belief in the\nprogressive understanding of truth in the theology of the church is very problematic.7 It\nis very difficult for me to see the progression in understanding during the course of\nchurch history that Longenecker refers to. </p>\n\n<p>Of all areas of theology, ethics is the one area which seems to offer the most promise\nin finding a progression of some sort. The church was, after all, involved in the\nabolitionist movement, and more recently in agitating for the rights of the poor and\nwomen. However, on closer examination, we find that there are two counterbalancing facts\nthat must be weighed before accepting this tempting conclusion. </p>\n\n<p>First, in all of the areas mentioned above, only a small portion of the church was\ninvolved on the right side of the issues. In each area, there were (and are) many\ntheologians who have argued the opposite side. Often the wrong ones were in the majority.\nIf this is so, how can such a standard as the church be of <i>any </i>use in determining\nethics? If we answer that the theologians must be measured by the Bible to see if they are\nright, then we have returned to the single source of moral authority. What then was gained\nby ever suggesting a second source in the first place? </p>\n\n<p>Secondly, once a second source of knowledge is put forward, it will either tend to\nreplace the Bible in the sense that the second authority becomes a grid through which we\ninterpret Scripture, or it will dwindle in importance as we realize that every assertion\nof the second source must be measured by the Bible. We see examples of both of these\npossibilities in the history of the church as well as the modern scene. </p>\n\n<p>From history, it is possible to argue that most of the great religious movements have\nstumbled when they began to view the findings of their founder(s) as a second source of\nspiritual knowledge. Thus, the Roman Catholics view canon law as a second authority, but\nin fact it has become the final authority, since the Bible must be interpreted by it. The\nreformed frequently refer to various catechisms and confessions, and tend to understand\nthe Bible in light of those sources. Many Lutheran laymen study Luther and know his views\nbetter than they do the Bible. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, no one can say they come to the Bible with no system of some sort already in\nmind. However, it is my view that this is an unfortunate element of subjectivity based on\nthe fall of mankind which good hermeneutics are designed to minimize. </p>\n\n<p>The best use of the discipline in history of interpretation should be strictly for\ncomparison and stimulation of further thought. It would be hazardous in the extreme in my\nview, to suggest that the history of interpretation represents a progression analogous to\nthe progressive revelation found in the Bible.8 Rather I think the history of\ninterpretation represents a cycle, with periodic returns to a biblical position, followed\nby regression into confusion. The only way to tell which eras were more or less faithful\nto the truth is to compare their doctrine to the Bible. That being the case, there seems\nto be no point in viewing their teaching both as that which is measured, and that which it\nis measured by.9 </p>\n\n<p>In conclusion then, I find it impossible to admit that there is any source of special\nrevelation other than the Bible itself. Other sources may help us check our reasoning to\nsee if we have properly interpreted the Word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=christian%20ethics\">Contact\nDennis with a comment or question</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/ethic_a.htm\">Return to the Ethics table of contents</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\">Return to the Essays page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/ethic2.htm\">Read on to the next section in Ethics</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to the Xenos home page</a> \n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n</p>\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Toward An Approach to Christian Ethics","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/ethic1.htm"}

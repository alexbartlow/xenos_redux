There were\ncells of activity right across southern Europe by the year 1208 when the crusade against\nthe Albigensians was proclaimed by Innocent III. </p>\n\n<p>In this year there began a crusade against the Cathari60 akin to the one that had been\ngoing on against the Muslims for some time. This was the first time the crusade concept\nhad been used against dissidents who called themselves Christian. \"For twenty long\nyears Languedoc and Provence in France were subjected to a blood bath which not only wiped\nout the most advanced culture of the time but introduced into the Church, and from there\nthroughout the West, the rule that any ideological deviation must be crushed by\nforce.\"61 </p>\n\n<p>It is important to remember that this period (1150-1300) were the years of the zenith\nof papal temporal power. Innocent III described himself as \"set between God and man,\nlower than God but higher than man, who judges all and is judged by no one. . .\"62 He\ndeclared that, \"the priesthood was as superior to the kingship as the soul to the\nbody,\" and he informed the nobles of Tuscany that, \"just as the moon derives its\nlight from the sun . . .so too the royal power derives the splendor of its dignity from\nthe pontifical authority.\"63 As has been the case so often in history, greater\npolitical power for the institutional church has been bad news for Christian minorities. </p>\n\n<p>This was also the pattern that would characterize Roman Catholic reaction to the\nWaldensians for the next 450 years. The history of the Waldensians during this period is\nan incredible litany of genocidal disaster. This was the period of the inquisition in\nEurope, and it is through the well kept records of the inquisition that we follow the\nspread of the Waldensians movement throughout Europe. Tourn lists some of the major\npersecutions after the crusade of 1208: \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li>We know that at the beginning of the 14th century there were enough Poor remaining in\n    France that the inquisitor Jacques Fournier, who later became Pope Benedict XII, undertook\n    court trials against them. </li>\n  <li>The transference of the papacy to Avignon in the middle of the 14th century was\n    apparently the signal for a brutal repression against Waldensians in the Dauphine, for the\n    beleaguered Pope was evidently not disposed to tolerate any expression of dissidence so\n    near to his exiled see. </li>\n  <li>In the year 1380. . . [a severe] round-up was begun under the inquisitors Martin of\n    Prague and Peter Zwicker. These two were commissioned to bring to trial or to force the\n    conversion of Waldensians through much of Europe. <br>\n    Their systematic effort began in Bavaria, continuing in the following year in the region\n    of Erfurt, and in 1392 in the province of Brandenberg. The inquisitors then proceeded to\n    Stettin, where they held a trial of 400 Waldensians. <br>\n    <br>\n    Their reports speak of activities in various cities of what are now Germany,\n    Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and of their success in the city of Bern, Switzerland, in\n    getting 130 suspects to abjure heresy and return to the Church's fold. They reported a\n    similar success in Fribourg with some 50 Waldensians. </li>\n  <li>. . .in the latter part of the century the inquisition was resumed in full intensity\n    under the direction of a Franciscan, Francesco Borelli. So obsessed was this monk with his\n    pursuit of heretics that it was said that every prison from Embrun to Avignon was full to\n    overflowing. As a result, Pope Gregory IX himself had to appeal for alms for the hapless\n    prisoners. </li>\n  <li>. . . in 1450, the inquisitors were sent in to deal with Alpine dissidents. In that year\n    the whole valley of Luserna was placed under interdiction on the charge of having resisted\n    the authorities. </li>\n  <li>Another inquisitorial sweep took place in 1475, including interminable court trials\n    against anyone who failed to cooperate fully in the drive. . . .the counts of Luserna\n    themselves were. . . charged with being too lenient toward the Waldensians--for which they\n    were duly warned and subjected to heavy fines. </li>\n  <li>. . .Charles I at last called for full scale military action against the dissidents, and\n    was joined, from the French side, by the declaration of a crusade against the Waldensians\n    which lasted from 1487-89. The latter was directed by the infamous papal legate, Alberta\n    Cattane<br>\n    . . . There the governor of Savoy, with the full consent of Charles VIII of France,\n    undertook a veritable and thorough going crusade against the hapless population. As in\n    other places and times in the Middle Ages, it was under the patronage of the Pope and\n    organized by his legate<br>\n    . . .[the village of] Pragelato found itself squarely in the path of the crusaders, so\n    that it was invaded and sacked in the winter of 1487. A fate similar to that of Pragelato\n    was in store for the Waldensians in the valleys of Argentieres and Vallouise. These folk\n    had been consistently pacifist by tradition, so that they did not resist when the invaders\n    came. The crusaders then proceeded to level their villages, destroying every trace of the\n    Waldensians heritage. </li>\n  <li>Francis I. . .in 1545 named the president of Aix's parliament personally to lead a papal\n    army from Avignon to clear the area entirely of Waldensian presence. The Luberon folk were\n    suddenly caught in a vise. <br>\n    . . .The mercenary soldiers engaged for the sweep did not stop until they had devastated\n    the whole region and obliterated every trace of the Waldensian villages. A few survivors\n    did manage to escape to Switzerland, but the lot of all the rest was either death by the\n    sword or life sentences as galley-slaves on French ships. </li>\n  <li>. . .On June 5, 1561, the town of San Sisto, with its 6,000 inhabitants, was burned to\n    the ground. <br>\n    . . .Guardia Piemontese, its neighbor, was likewise destroyed. Prisoners were burned like\n    torches, sold as slaves to the Moors or condemned to die of starvation in the dungeons of\n    Cosenza. The massacre reached its height at Montalto Uffugo on June 11th. On the steps in\n    front of the parish church, 88 Waldensians were slaughtered one by one, like animals\n    brought to market. </li>\n  <li>If the military operation lasted only a few weeks, the work of Catholic indoctrination,\n    Jesuit style, continued for years. The Jesuits were determined to obliterate every\n    evidence that Waldensians had been present in Calabria. They almost succeeded, except in\n    one small respect: there is still a hint of the Provencal language in the daily speech of\n    the inhabitants.64 </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The list of atrocities goes on and on, in fact far too long for detailed consideration\nhere.65 The point that becomes clear is that every effort was made on numerous occasions\nto eliminate the Poor of Lyons in the customary way. At various points this policy was\nclose to final success. Yet, the Waldensian movement was never eliminated. </p>\n\n<p>Another tactic that was employed briefly with success by Pope Innocent III was to take\nadvantage of the differences between Waldo and the Lombards in 1208 to win the Poor Men\nback to the Church. Beginning in 1208 he encouraged the formation and spread of Pauperes\nCatholici (\"Poor Catholics\") who under ecclesiastical direction would follow\nsuch of the practices of the Waldenses as the Church could approve. By this means many who\nhad been attracted by the Poor Men were held or won back.66 </p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the Waldensians continued to grow at a surprising rate. The pattern of\ngrowth appears to have been the result of systematic underground discipleship and\nwitnessing. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>. . .men and women, great and lesser, day and night do not cease to learn and teach;\n  the workman who labors all day teaches or learns at night . . .When someone has been a\n  student seven days, he seeks someone else to teach, as one curtain pulls another. Whoever\n  excuses himself, saying that he is not able to learn, they say to him, \"Learn but one\n  word each day, and after a year you will know three hundred, and you will\n  progress.\"67 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tourn has a remarkable map showing areas where Waldensians presence can be documented,\nreproduced here.68 </p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Map of Europe \" src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/waldo.gif\" width=\"204\"> Map of Europe shows shaded\npatches all over western and some of eastern Europe </p>\n\n<p>In 1517 - the very year of Luther's protest--the Archbishop of Turin made record of a\npastoral visit to the Alpine valleys in which he singled out for concern the ongoing\npresence of Waldensian groups practicing their faith.69</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/waldo1.htm\">Go back to the Waldensian table of contents</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/chhist.htm\">Go back to the Church History page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/waldo7.htm\">Read on into the next section of \"Waldensians\"</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Go to the Xenos home page</a> \n\n</p><dl>\n  <dt><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=waldensian\">Ask\n    Dennis a question or share a comment.</a> </dt>\n</dl>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Waldensian Movement From Waldo to the Reformation V","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/waldo6.htm"}

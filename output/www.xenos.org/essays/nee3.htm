Instead, we will summarize the major trends and characteristics of his ministry and\ndoctrine before considering the legacy of his ministry in China today.24 </p>\n\n<p>Nee was said to be, \". . . a very active and mischievous youngster who always\nruined furniture and dropped vases. When playing among either brothers and sisters of\nneighboring children, Nee always took a leading part and initiated all kinds of new\ntricks. From his very early days Nee displayed his gift of leadership.\"25 </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Conversion and Growth</h4>\n\n<p>Nee's conversion came at the age of 16 in 1919. His Mother, Huo-ping, had reaffirmed\nher commitment to the Lord at a series of evangelistic meetings led by Dora Yu, the female\nevangelist who had impressed Huo-ping during her college days. When Huo-ping went to\nWatchman and confessed to unjustly beating him, Watchman decided to attend the meetings as\nwell, and was powerfully converted. He offered his entire life to God for His service that\nday, and never changed his mind thereafter.26 </p>\n\n<p>During the early 1920's, Nee was involved in itinerant evangelistic preaching, based\nout of Foochow. He would usually go out with a small ministry team to preach in a village\nthat had not previously heard the gospel. Kinnear says that Nee was usually successful in\nreaching good numbers of people on these trips.27 Some trips were undertaken with his\nmother (who also preached), including trips outside of China, to Indonesia. Nee's method\nof church planting was to begin with a small group of people meeting in a house. Later, a\nbuilding would be sought if the group became large. From then on, they would hold both\nhome meetings and meetings in the building. They would invariably train indigenous\nleadership for these groups.28 Nee also received a bachelor's degree during this period\nfrom Trinity college in Foochow. During the later 1920's he lost at least two years of\nwork because of his tuberculosis. It was during this period that he married Chaing\nPin-Hwai, a family friend who had graduated in literature from the famous Yin King\nUniversity. Her knowledge of literature would assist Nee in his writing and translation\nwork. He remained with her until he was imprisoned.29 </p>\n\n<p>During the 1930's, Nee traveled widely in China focusing more on church planting than\nhe had previously. The base for his operations moved to Shanghai in 1932. During this\nperiod, he also made a trip to England, attending the Keswick convention, and eventually\nhaving a falling-out with his hosts, the Exclusive Brethren of the \"London\nGroup\", because he refused to separate himself from other Christians.30</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>World War II</h4>\n\n<p>When The Japanese attacked China in 1936, freedom of movement gradually became more\ndifficult. The economy also suffered. Nee seems to have been able to travel into Japanese\noccupied territory with some frequency, although he spent most of his time in nationalist\nareas. It was during this period (in 1942) that he went into business with his brother who\nwas a research chemist. He became chairman of the board of China Biological and Chemical\nLaboratories, a pharmaceutical company. His declared reason for doing so was the fact that\nmany of the leaders of the Little Flock were short of money, and this was a way that he\ncould make tents and support \"those with him\" like Paul did.31 </p>\n\n<p>His fellow workers were against this move on his part, and eventually demanded that he\ncease preaching in the church in Shanghai. Therefore Nee was under church discipline, and\nnot involved in preaching for several years in the mid 1940's. </p>\n\n<p>In 1947, Nee was restored to leadership in the Little Flock church in Shanghai, and\nagain was active in church-planting and training of Christian workers. During the last few\nyears of ministry before the revolution, the Little Flock became involved in migration\nevangelism, based on the scattering of the church in Jerusalem in Acts 8. This tactic,\ninvolved moving an entire house church into an area that was unreached.32 The results of\nthis work were apparently striking.33 </p>\n\n<p>Although some of Nee's time was spent preaching to a large (5000-7000 attendance)\nchurch in Shanghai, the main result of his work was the founding of hundreds of house\nchurches throughout China. These were lay-led groups that centered on Bible study,\nwitnessing to the neighbors, and fellowship. Singing, prayer and communion were also\npracticed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Communist Takeover and Persecution</h4>\n\n<p>Mao too power in 1949. During the next several years he consolidated and extend his\ncontrol of the country. In January of 1956, Nee was brought up on charges by the local\nauthorities in Shanghai, and they held a public \"accusation meeting.\" In front\nof over 2500 people he was accused of espionage, licentiousness and stealing church funds.\nHis doctrine was also denounced because his preaching on the \"last days\" tended\nto demoralize the workers. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Days after his release\nin 1972, Watchman Nee died in his home province. He was 69 years old.34 </p>\n\n<p>It is interesting to compare Nee to John Wesley. Wesley's work won, and incorporated\ninto his fellowships about 120,000 people over the course of his 52 year ministry. Because\nof his work, and its aftermath, he is known to most people in the western world. The books\non Wesley in an average library usually take up whole shelves, analyzing every aspect of\nhis life and teaching. </p>\n\n<p>Watchman Nee, probably exceeded Wesley in terms of the actual size of his ministry,\neven though the duration of his ministry was only a little over one-half as long, and was\ncarried out under circumstances including an 11 year-long world war. As will be seen\nlater, the Little Flock movement probably reached a size of 150,000-300,000 active\nparticipants by the time of the revolution. He also appears to have spawned a striking\naftermath. Yet he is virtually unknown to westerners, and most libraries have nothing on\nhis biography at all!35</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee4.htm\" target=\"_self\">Read on to the next section of Nee and the House\nChurch Movement</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=watchman\">Ask Dennis a\nquestion or share a comment.</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Go back to the Essays page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/chhist.htm\" target=\"_top\">Go back to the Church History page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Go back to the Xenos home page</a> </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Watchman Nee Section III","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/nee3.htm"}

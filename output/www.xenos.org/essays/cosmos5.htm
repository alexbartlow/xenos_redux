It was thought that the lack of a scientific\nexplanation validated supernatural explanations. Although some supernatural explanations\nwere no more than superstition this false validation had the consequence of permitting\nsuperstition considerable authority for a time. As science began to explain heretofore\nmysterious processes the elimination of superstition was viewed as invalidation of belief\nin the supernatural. This lead to another false tenet - mechanical reductionism.\nMechanical reductionism asserts that physical explanations are complete in their\ndescription of reality and that the properties of the whole are determined entirely by the\nproperties of its parts. Since the evidence for the existence of the supernatural was\nbelieved to reside in the \"mystery\" of nature, as science endeavored to\neliminate that \"mystery\" it was viewed as defeat by some Christians and as a\nvictory by some atheists. Some Christians viewed growing scientific knowledge as a threat.\nTo the contrary, the real threat to any true belief, be it scientific or religious, is\nignorance, not knowledge acquired through scientific methods. While science has its\ndeficiencies it has had incomparable success in explaining and developing an understanding\nof our natural surroundings. This point is brought home by John Houghton<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos5.htm#Footnote1B\" name=\"Footnote1A\">Footnote1</a> who quotes a friend as commenting,\n\"Penicillin is worth an awful lot of prayer!\".</p>\n\n<p>The threat from ignorance is particularly manifested when certain philosophical\npresuppositions are confused with the conclusions drawn from scientific data or biblical\ntext (i.e., ignorance of presuppositions). This produces the false appearance of sound\nconclusions when these philosophical presuppositions become unconsciously embedded or\nconcealed in the interpretative methods applied to the data or text. Thus scientific\nexplanations and conclusions become confused with the philosophical interpretations that\nfrequently accompany them. This problem is evident in the following excerpt from David L.\nBender and Bruno Leone<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos5.htm#Footnote2B\" name=\"Footnote2A\">Footnote2</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Religion requires mystery. In other words, where there is mystery there is\nignorance: where there is mystery, there you can find god offered as an explanation to\nfill the void of ignorance. Prehistorical humans invented gods to answer the mysteries of\nnature, and invented religions as a means to influence divine will. What is mystery's\nmortal enemy? Science! Every time science clears up a mystery, explains the heretofore\nunexplainable, a little of religion's realm is taken from it. Each time science pushes the\nboundaries of our ignorance back a little, god has less territory in the human mind to\nroam in.</p>\n\n<p>Religion is not science's sibling, Atheism is! Atheism is the only philosophy that has\nnothing to fear from science because Atheism grows stronger with each new advance of\nscience.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately certain Christians have subscribed to this view of science and perhaps\nunwittingly adopted this view of their religion as well. Thus modern cosmology's attempt\nto demystify the physical details of creation have been viewed as a threat to the biblical\naccount. While science has dispossessed superstition of its authority and hopefully some\nof its influence it has not invalidated the existence of the supernatural. Although there\nhave been many claims that science frequently casts a menacing shadow on the supernatural\ncomponents of Christianity this is more a matter of perception than fact. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos5.htm#Footnote1A\" name=\"Footnote1B\">Footnote1</a></p>\n\n<p>12.

Richard Niebuhr (not the well-known neo-orthodox theologian) contrasts what he calls\n\"the positive and warm ethics of love which characterizes the First Letter of\nJohn,\" with the \"largely negative morality: avoidance of sin and fearsome\npreparation for the coming day of judgment,\" taught by Tertullian.29 </p>\n\n<p>This seems to be a very important distinction. It is tragically possible to apply\nethics that are directly and explicitly Biblical in a way that belies the very spirit in\nwhich those ethics were given. It is also possible to cloak one's fear of loss of control\n(either of one's self or of others) under the cover-all of biblical ethics. The result can\nbe \"fortress theology\"; the view of the church that sees herself besieged and on\nthe defense against the dangerous \"gates of Hades\". Interestingly though, it is\nvery difficult to understand the metaphor given by Christ in Mt.16 this way, since city\ngates are not usually involved in offensive operations, and in fact should pose no threat\nto the church at all. Rather, it would appear to be the Church which poses a direct mortal\nthreat to the gates of Hades-- a danger so real that those gates will not prevail against\nher. </p>\n\n<p>This point is important because it will profoundly affect the posture taken with regard\nto the world-system and society by the church. The fortress outlook can be seen in action\nin the monastic ideal, particularly in the earlier days of its formulation.30 Monasticism\nrepresents a flight from secular culture that can not be justified in view of the central\nrole that love of others is to play in the ethical life of the church. </p>\n\n<p>Such a flight can only be explained as a statement of ethical prioritization. The\ndangers of sin contamination are seen to be greater on balance than any benefit that might\nresult from admixture of the faithful with the world system. </p>\n\n<p>Although the monastic movement is an extreme example, (and easy to understand for that\nreason) it is hardly unique. There are lesser forms of fortress theology applications\nevident in mainline fundamentalism today as well. The main point is that sins of omission\ntend to be viewed by this type of theology as less evil than sins of commission. Yet if\nthe prioritizing of ethics taught by Christ is accepted, omitting to practice love would\nbe a very serious sin, while an act of passion such as cursing would be comparatively\nunimportant.31 </p>\n\n<p>We conclude then by finding that a truly biblical ethic should issue in, \"faith\nworking through love,\" (Gal. 5:6). Any system which ostensibly follows the letter of\nthe law in the Old or New Testaments, while making it possible to hide one's true failings\nbehind a mask of perfunctory nomism is decidedly sub-biblical in tone. The failure of\nnegative \"sin avoidance\" ethical systems is that the real issues in biblical\nethics are lost amidst a forest of unintelligible detail, until it is possible for a camel\nto slide unnoticed down our throat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=christian%20ethics\">Contact\nDennis with a comment or question</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/ethic_a.htm\">Return to the Ethics table of contents</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\">Return to the Essays page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/ethic5.htm\">Browse the Endnotes for \"Ethics\"</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to the Xenos home page</a>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Toward An Approach to Christian Ethics IV","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/ethic4.htm"}

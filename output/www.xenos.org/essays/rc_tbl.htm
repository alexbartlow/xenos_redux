Several prominent evangelicals \n  have called on the church to sign an accord expressing unity in the Body of \nChrist, which, they argue includes the Catholic Church. </h2>\n\n<p>At Xenos, we <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/um1-1a.htm\">define the \n  church </a>in a way that is incompatible with this declaration, regardless of \n  whether or not we view Catholic doctrine as sufficiently close to ours to warrant \n  some level of cooperation. At Xenos, we would not sign a declaration that <b>any</b> \n  church institution (including our own) lies entirely within the circle of the \n  Body of Christ. At the same time, we would not deny the true Christianity of \n  particular individuals within churches which may not teach evangelical doctrine. \n  Therefore, in our view, the command to cultivate unity would apply only to that \n  part of any church composed of people truly spiritually reborn. This is why \n  we have not agreed to sign onto this accord. </p>\n<p>During our discussions with leaders outside Xenos on this \n  issue, we have been challenged to consider the changes in Catholic doctrine \n  embodied in the new Catechism. Therefore, senior pastor, Dennis McCallum took \n  a training paper by Jose Flores on Catholicism and updated it with teaching \n  from the new Catechism. This paper is helpful in assessing the new Catechism, \n  which in our view (and in the view of its authors), changes nothing in historic \n  Catholic teachings. </p>\n<p>This paper is a good resource for those needing direct \n  citations from authoritative Catholic literature (see the important discussion \n  about sources in section 1). All citations are verbatim, and in context, and \n  all emphases are original unless otherwise noted.

Scrutinize the Sources. </h3>\n<ol>\n  <li>Volumes on the history and the doctrine of the Roman \n    Catholic church are legion. Authorship includes Catholics and Protestants \n    alike and they vary a great deal in accuracy and level of authority. Some \n    of the material written by non-Catholic authors is overly biased against the \n    Catholic church, just as Catholic sources may distort in their favor. Some \n    material is poorly documented, if at all. </li>\n  <li>Thus, the student of Catholic doctrine must evaluate \n    the sources in order to legitimately represent the object under analysis. \n    This is especially true when attempting to study a complicated subject such \n    as the doctrine of the Roman Catholic church. To be authoritative, study must \n    include material which the Catholic church has \"officially\" approved \n    as representing its teaching. </li>\n</ol>\n<h3>B. How to identify \"Official\" Catholic Church \n  Literature</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li>There are two types of \"approval\" given by \n    the Catholic church to literature written about any aspect of the Catholic \n    church. </li>\n  <li>The first type is the Nihil Obstat and <i>Imprimatur</i> \n    designation. <i>Nihil Obstat</i>, means, \"nothing stands in the way.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote1\">[footnote \n    1]</a> That is, it doesn't contradict Catholic doctrine. <i>Imprimatur</i> \n    literally means, \"let it be printed\".<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote2\">[footnote \n    2]</a> A Catholic official, usually a Bishop, approves the publishing of the \n    material. This designation is found on the front copyright page of an approved \n    document. </li>\n  <li>However, it is important to note that this type of \n    approval is nothing but a permission to publish something non-heretical about \n    the Catholic church. But the source may include personal opinions which, while \n    not heretical, are not the official position of the church. The Nihil Obstat--Imprimatur \n    is not a formal declaration on the part of the Catholic church indicating \n    that the approved document officially represents Catholic doctrine. \n    </li>\n  <li>An official document published by the Catholic church \n    proper will identify itself as such. It will do so very clearly and at the \n    beginning of the document. Such documents include Papal \"encyclicals\" \n    (pamphlets), conciliar decrees (decrees of church councils), special post-conciliar \n    documents and a few \"catechisms\" (i.e., The Baltimore Catechism). \n    As of 1994, the church has released the Catechism of the Catholic Church.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote3\">[footnote \n    3]</a> This text is now considered the most modern, clear and authoritative \n    source of Catholic doctrine. While earlier authorized texts are still considered \n    true, most modern Catholics prefer to follow references in this new and improved \n    text. Therefore, it has become the definitive text for Catholic doctrine. \n    Other text are still useful for comparison. </li>\n  <li>Those doctrines, modern or ancient, which the Catholic \n    church designates as infallible are given the status \"De-Fide.\" \n    De-Fide is a Latin term which literally means \"of faith\".<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote4\">[footnote \n    4]</a> </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2><a name=\"histevents\">History and Events</a> </h2>\n<h3>A. The Primacy of Rome</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li>At the beginning of Christianity the city of Rome already \n    was regarded as the center of civilization. Rome was also the capital of the \n    Roman empire through some of the fourth century AD. Thus, there were very \n    few early local churches whose leading members did not have to visit Rome \n    on occasion. So the church in Rome tended to have contact with more Christians \n    from all over the empire than did any of the other local churches. </li>\n  <li>67 AD. is the generally accepted date of Peter's death. \n    At that time the Catholic church claims the second \"Pontiff,\" Linus, \n    succeeded Peter as the first Pope in Rome.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote5\">[footnote \n    5]</a> They claim this succession gave Rome its primacy over the other centers \n    of Christianity. </li>\n  <li>The destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. served to remove \n    what would have been a major rival city. Had Jerusalem continued to exist, \n    historians reason that Rome would have had an even more difficult time asserting \n    its primacy. Ultimately, Jerusalem could have claimed to have given the gospel \n    to Rome. Most importantly, Peter would have been sent from Jerusalem to Rome; \n    thus Jerusalem would have been the \"alma mater\" and the prime city \n    of Christianity. (Tradition claims that Peter visited Rome, like Paul. And \n    tradition also claims that like Paul, Peter died in Rome).<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote6\">[footnote \n    6]</a> </li>\n  <li>In approximately 96 AD., Clement of Rome (the Catholic \n    church's fourth Pope) wrote a letter of rebuke and admonishment to the church \n    at Corinth. Catholics cite this letter as corroborative evidence to prove \n    both the primacy of the church of Rome and the primacy of the Bishop of Rome. \n    The position taken by Clement is one of \"teacher\".<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote7\">[footnote \n    7]</a> He takes it upon himself to admonish the bishops in Corinth on matters \n    of faith and practice. This, they claim, showed that the bishop of Rome was \n    known even at this early date to be supreme. </li>\n  <li>Eusebius preserved a fragment of a letter written about \n    170 AD. by Dionysius, bishop of Corinth, to the Church of Rome. This letter \n    indicates that the Church of Rome already had a reputation for being hospitable \n    to strangers and for being very generous to other churches with their money.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote8\">[footnote \n    8]</a> Thus by merely suspending her friendly relations with another church, \n    especially a poor one in need, the church in Rome could inflict a severe penalty \n    on such a church. </li>\n  <li>Finally, in 312 A.D. Constantine won the battle of the Milvian Bridge. He attributed this victory to the &#x201C;god&#x201D; of the Christians, resulting in the Edict of Milan in 313 A.D. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote9\">[footnote \n  9]</a>which declared the toleration of all religions, including Christianity, throughout the empire. (although the adoption of Christianity as the official religion of the state did not occur until A.D. 380 under the reign of Theodosius I). This paved the way for the emergence of the Catholic church as a political power.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"risepap\">B. The Rise of the Papacy</a> \n  </h3>\n<ol>\n  <li>Ultimately the rise of the papacy can be traced to \n    the rise of the primacy of Rome. </li>\n  <li>In 256 AD., according to Cyprian, Stephen, bishop of \n    Rome claimed to be \"bishop of bishops\" on the basis of being Peter's \n    successor<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote10\">[footnote 10]</a>. </li>\n  <li>In 343 AD., at the Council of Serdicia, precedence \n    was given to the bishop of Rome. The eastern half of the Roman empire was \n    experiencing a doctrinal controversy with the Arians. Therefore it was felt \n    that if an eastern church needed the input of a high ranking church leader, \n    they should seek out Justin the bishop of Rome (because he was from the western \n    church). This was done to safeguard the churches in need of advise against \n    any possible Arian influence.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote11\">[footnote 11]</a> \n    </li>\n  <li>By 605 AD. the papacy was fully established. Boniface \n    III assumed the title \"Universal Bishop\". </li>\n  <li>In 1303 Pope Bonafice VIII issued the Bull \"Unum \n    Sanctum\". This was the first papal address to the universal church and; \n    therefore, the first case of the Pope writing from his supposed infallible \n    position.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote13\">[footnote 13]</a> </li>\n  <li>In 1378 AD., the papacy experienced a schism; known \n    as the great Western Schism. After the death of Gregory XI, Urban VI was elected \n    but later rejected by the same electors. Clement VII was elected to replace \n    Urban VI. However, the Italian people were loyal to Urban VI, a fellow Italian, \n    while the French were loyal to Clement VII who was French. Ultimately, the \n    Catholic church deposed them both, and set up a new Pope, Boniface IX.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote14\">[footnote \n    14]</a> It should be noted that some Catholic historians don't even acknowledge \n    this schism because they don't acknowledge the election of Clement VII at \n    this time.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote15\">[footnote 15]</a> </li>\n  <li>By 1493 the papacy had grown into such a powerful political \n    and religious entity that it could grant ownership rights to entire sections \n    of the globe. \"In a series of bulls from 1493 to 1510, popes Alexander \n    VI and Julius II granted the Spanish kings the right of royal patronage over \n    the church in the newly discovered Americas<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote16\">[footnote \n    16]</a>. </li>\n</ol>\n<h3>C. Other Events of Interest</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li>The Council of Chalcedon, 451 AD., gave the same rights \n    and honors to the bishop of Constantinople as to the bishop of Rome.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote17\">[footnote \n    17]</a> </li>\n  <li>Charlemagne, 771-814, became the emperor of the first \n    \"Holy Roman Empire\". During his reign, he declared paganism illegal \n    in such territories as Saxony (part of modern Germany). This resulted in massacres \n    in which as many as 45,000 non-Christians were killed in a single day.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote18\">[footnote \n    18]</a> </li>\n  <li>In 1054 there was a major division within the church. \n    The church divided into east (Orthodox) and west (Roman Catholic). The eastern \n    wing excommunicated Pope Leo IX. This is known to church historians as \"The \n    Great East-West Schism\".<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote19\">[footnote 19]</a> \n    </li>\n  <li>In 1095 the first of the eight religiously motivated \n    \"Crusades\" began. Pope Urban II, at the Council of Clermont 1095, \n    proclaimed the great enterprise to recapture the Holy Lands and hopefully, \n    therefore, reunite east and west, with the cry \"God Wills It\".<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote20\">[footnote \n    20]</a> What ensued for the next two hundred years was the extermination of \n    hundreds of thousands of Jews and Moslems in the name of Christ. </li>\n  <li>The middle of the twelfth century saw the establishment \n    of the famed Roman Inquisition. The inquisition was a church run program designed \n    to confront and kill heretics. The scandalous Spanish Inquisition was instituted \n    by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella in 1478. This inquisition was empowered \n    by Pope Sixtus IV.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote21\">[footnote 21]</a> It resulted \n    in the death of hundreds of thousands of, mainly, Jews and ancient Indians \n    of the Americas.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote22\">[footnote 22]</a> </li>\n  <li>On October 31, 1517, Martin Luther nailed his ninety \n    five thesis to the door of the Castle Church (the official bulletin board \n    of the university) in Wittenburg, Saxony. His intent was to offer these as \n    subjects for theological discussion, not as a protest. His theses' can be \n    summarized by seven major points<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote23\">[footnote \n    23]</a> \n    <ul>\n      <li>He restricted the significance and value of indulgences \n        to symbolizing the Church's true and actual forgiveness of ecclesiastical \n        penalties. </li>\n      <li>This true and actual forgiveness of penalties could \n        apply only to the living. </li>\n      <li>There was no such thing as the treasury of merits.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote24\">[footnote \n        24]</a> In other words, he held that good works could not be applied to \n        the \"penitent\" Christian. The Church claimed the right to dispense \n        merits, usually after a donation was given. This was called an indulgence. \n        </li>\n      <li>Luther believed that the Pope should have granted \n        the indulgences free; that is, if in fact he really had the power to do \n        so. </li>\n      <li>Luther also drew a distinction between repentance \n        and the sacrament of penance (the confessing of sins to a priest for the \n        absolution of sins). He believed that a repentant sinner did not attempt \n        to escape punishment by indulgence but accepted it in humility and faith.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote25\">[footnote \n        25]</a> </li>\n      <li>True sorrow for sins (contrition) resulted in forgiveness \n        of sins without indulgence. </li>\n      <li>Therefore the sale of indulgences was leading people \n        into a false security with respect to salvation. </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Thus what Luther intended to be a mere theological \n    discussion exploded into the controversy known as the Protestant Reformation. \n    Thus began the development of Protestantism as we know it today. </li>\n  <li>The Council of Trent, 1545-1563, was the Catholic church's \n    response Protestant Reformation. This is the time that the word \"Protestant\" \n    became popular; because men like Luther were \"protesting\" against \n    the Catholic church. The purpose of the council was to refute the Protestant \n    \"heresies\" and clearly state the \"orthodox\" (Catholic) \n    position. The result was the vigorous condemnation of all the reformers. Some \n    of the major statements of the council are listed as follows:<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/rc_tbl.htm#Footnote26\">[footnote \n    26]</a> \n    <ul>\n      <li>Scripture and tradition are equal authorities as \n        standards of divine revelation. </li>\n      <li>The Vulgate translation of the Bible (including \n        the apocrypha) written by Jerome was declared the authentic text. \n        </li>\n      <li>Salvation must come through water baptism and by \n        the merits of the sufferings of Christ. In the \"merits of the sufferings \n        of Christ\" are also included the sufferings of the \"saints\". \n        </li>\n      <li>Faith alone is not enough for salvation. \"Canon \n        9.

The Pillars of Catholic Doctrine</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li>The whole of Catholic doctrine rests on its view of \n    the sources for divine revelation; namely, tradition, the Bible, and the teaching \n    office of the Catholic church. </li>\n  <li>But even among these three sources, which they deem \n    equal in authority, the most crucial \"pillar\" is that of tradition. \n    As is evident in the quotations presented in this study, the tradition source \n    includes the oral and written elements. It is this source, primarily, that \n    the Catholic Church holds forth to prove that their line of popes succeeds \n    Peter. And again it is the source of tradition to which the Catholic church \n    chiefly refers to support the primacy of the \"Roman\" Catholic church. \n    Thus, without proof for the papal succession from Peter and without proof \n    for the primacy of the Roman church, the Catholic church cannot support its \n    maternal view of the scriptures. Consequently, most of the unique Catholic \n    doctrines (temporal punishment, penance, the veneration of Mary and the saints, \n    the mass, etc.) would also not be able to stand. </li>\n  <li>It is important, therefore, that the serious student \n    of Catholic doctrine become very familiar with the patristic writings themselves. \n    Attempting to dialog with the Catholic pillars of doctrine from a standard \n    non-Catholic Bible is insufficient. To be sure, an understanding of the history \n    of the New Testament and of the scriptures cited by the Catholic church is \n    necessary. </li>\n</ol>\n<h3>B. Questions for Reflection</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li>What is the difference, if any, between the Catholic \n    church's Seven Sacraments and the so-called <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/mogcht.htm\">Means \n    of Growth</a>? </li>\n  <li>What is the difference between the Catholic view of \n    \"confession\" and your view of confessing sins to one another? \n    </li>\n  <li>If you think Catholic doctrine is \"unbiblical,\" \n    why are there over 60 million in the U.S. alone? </li>\n  <li>What, if anything, is wrong with the Catholic view \n    of Mt. 16:18-19? What was Christ granting to Peter? What bearing does that \n    have on today? </li>\n  <li>Are there areas in the non-essential theology or methodology \n    of your church that are vulnerable to unbiblical veneration? </li>\n</ol>\n<h3>C. Caution</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li>It would be wise to remember that the \"average\" \n    Catholic is hardly aware of any of the foundational development of their doctrine. \n    They are often even less aware of the more scandalous events found in the \n    history of the Catholic church. This is because the focus of their faith revolves \n    around the activity of their particular local church. </li>\n  <li>The material presented in this study is designed to \n    provide a better understanding of the Catholic church. The direction of any \n    particular dialog between Protestant and catholic must be decided individually. \n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to the Xenos home page</a></p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\">Return to the Essays page</a></p>\n\n\n<h2>Footnotes</h2>\n\n<p><a name=\"Footnote1\">1. </a>John A.

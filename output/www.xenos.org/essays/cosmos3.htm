On this there is general agreement. On the\nremaining details of the Genesis creation narrative there have been many views and their\nremains much controversy. These controversies have their origin in the following issues:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x95; Literary genre of text: literal, allegorical, mythical</p>\n\n<p>&#x95; Sequential order of events: chronological or topical</p>\n\n<p>&#x95; Category of observation: noumenological or phenomenological</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attempts to interpret the text providing the primary description of creation as given\nin Genesis 1:1-31 have produced several schools of thought. These schools of thought are\nrepresented by the following views (some of which are incoherent but nevertheless included\nhere for completeness).<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos3.htm#Footnote2B\" name=\"Footnote2A\">Footnote2</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x95; <b>The Purely Religious View </b>- divorces the biblical account from scientific\nrelevance or reconciliation.</p>\n\n<p>&#x95; <b>The Concordist View</b> - the biblical account of creation when properly\nunderstood will exhibit a one-to-one correspondence with the correct scientific cosmology.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos3.htm#Footnote3B\" name=\"Footnote3A\">Footnote3</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x95; <b>Pictorial Day and Moderate Concordism</b> - regards the creation days in\nGenesis as pictorial representations of the major creative events. These events are\ncoupled with progressive creationism but are not considered as a literal chronology of\ntheir occurrence.</p>\n\n<p>&#x95; <b>The Twenty-Four-Hour-Day View</b> - holds that creation was effected in six\nliteral twenty-four-hour days.</p>\n\n<p>&#x95; <b>The Age-Day View</b> - the Hebrew word y&#xF4;m translated as day is used both in\nthe particular sense as a natural day or the general sense of a set span of time and so\nthe latter usage is taken to mean a long span of time in the Genesis account of creation.</p>\n\n<p>&#x95; <b>The Gap Theory</b> - postulates the creation in Genesis 1:1, followed by\ncatastrophe in 1:2 succeeded by re-creation.</p>\n\n<p>&#x95; <b>Creation/Revelation</b> - espouses the view of revelation of creation in six\ntwenty-four-hour periods.</p>\n\n<p>&#x95; <b>Re-creation/Revelation</b> - holds that Genesis 1:1-2 does not describe\nprimeval creation but a much later refashioning of a judgement-ridden earth in preparation\nfor a new order of creation (man) and the re-creation is described to man in six literal\ndays.</p>\n\n<p>&#x95; <b>The Local Creation View</b> - limits Genesis 1 to the re-creation of the\ngeneral Middle Eastern World.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The motivation for development of certain of these views<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos3.htm#Footnote4B\" name=\"Footnote4A\">Footnote4</a> seems to have been merely attempts to answer problems\nproduced by features in the geological record which had been interpreted to be\ncontradictory to the earth history interpreted from descriptions given by the biblical\nrecord (e.g., conclusions regarding the relatively young age of the earth assumed from\nbiblical genealogies and the occurrence of a diluvian flood). It is important to\nunderstand that some of these views of biblical cosmology are speculative and have no\nsound basis for their support. </p>\n\n<p>For the purposes of this discussion we will adopt only the two principal tenets given\nat the beginning of this section as our basic statement of biblical cosmology. However\nthere are several essential elements of biblical cosmology that are more philosophical\nstatements than scientific representations of the origin of the universe. These elements\nof the traditional doctrine of creation fall in to three categories: temporal,\nontological, and theological. The three categories make doctrinal statements about\ncreation that are distinct from statements regarding the providential nature of God. The\nthree important distinctions as identified by Barbour<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos3.htm#Footnote5B\" name=\"Footnote5A\">Footnote5</a> are:</p>\n\n<p>(1)<i> temporally</i>, creation was God's initial act and providence referred to his\nsubsequent acts;</p>\n\n<p>(2)<i> ontologically</i>, creation ex nihilo was God's act alone, establishing the\ncreaturely status of the whole world, whereas in providence he acts along with or through\nother existing causes to guide particular events;</p>\n\n<p>(3)<i> theologically</i>, creation represented God's absolute sovereignty,\ntranscendence, and freedom, whereas in the context of providence these attributes were\nqualified (in varying degrees) by recognition of human freedom, the lawfulness of nature,\nand divine immanence. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos3.htm#Footnote1A\" name=\"Footnote1B\">Footnote1</a></p>\n\n<p><i>The New Bible Dictionary, </i>2nd Edition.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos3.htm#Footnote2A\" name=\"Footnote2B\">Footnote2</a></p>\n\n<p><i>Unger's New Bible Dictionary</i>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos3.htm#Footnote3A\" name=\"Footnote3B\">Footnote3</a></p>\n\n<p>For an in depth development of this view and its reconciliation with the standard\nmodern cosmology theory see Hugh Ross's, <i>The Creator and the Cosmos</i>, Navpress,\n1993, and <i>The Fingerprint of God</i>, Promise Publishing Co., 1991.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos3.htm#Footnote4A\" name=\"Footnote4B\">Footnote4</a></p>\n\n<p>For example the local creation view.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos3.htm#Footnote5A\" name=\"Footnote5B\">Footnote5</a></p>\n\n<p>Ian G.Barbour, <i>Issues in Science and Religion</i>, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers,\n1971.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos4.htm\">\n\n<p>Read on to the next section in \"Cosmology\"</p></a>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmosa.htm\">Return to the Table of Contents</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/xessays.htm\">Return to the Crossroads Essays page</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to the Xenos home page</a> \n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n</p>\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"COSMOLOGY III","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos3.htm"}

Winter, \"About\nYou,\" (Pasadena, CA: U.S. Center for World Mission, 1983) p. 2. One has to suspect\nthat this figure is exaggerated. However, the fact that scholars are making these\nstatements certainly point to breath-taking growth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">4Bohr says that there were 750,000 Protestant Chinese Christians. This figure is\napparently based on formal church membership, which may overlook some converts involved in\ninformal types of fellowship. He also says that there were over 3 million Catholics,\nalthough much of this is to be discounted because of the Catholic practice of counting as\nCatholics all those who have been baptized Catholic. Since no adult decision is implied,\nthe number claimed by the Catholic church is often unrelated to the number actually\nattending mass with some regularity. Richard Bohr, \"State Religion in China Today:\nChristianity's Future in a Marxist Setting,\" <i>Missiology: An International Review</i>,\nVol. XI, No. 3 (July 1983) p. 321,323 WCE allows 1,200,000 Protestants in the year 1900!\nThese figures are impossible to reconcile. World Christian Encyclopedia, David B. Barrett\nEditor, p. 231. Winter allows 1-2 million true believers in 1949. See note #3 above.\nWagner holds for \"fewer than 1 million\" authentic believers in 1949. C. Peter\nWagner, <i>On The Crest of the Wave</i>, p. 30. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">5This figure is even more difficult to ascertain with certainty. We will probably never\nknow how many Christians were killed in this modern holocaust. According to Judith\nBanister, Chief of the Chinese Branch of the U.S. Bureau of the Census, \"More people\ndied in China during the period of the Great Leap forward than in all the battles of First\nWorld War, or the holocaust of Europe's Jews, or the Soviet Collectivization and Stalin's\nterror.\" Ansley of The National Academy of Sciences and Princeton University says\nthat \"about 27 million\" died. Both quoted in Carl Lawrence, <i>The Church in\nChina: How It Survives and Prospers Under Communism</i>, (Minneapolis: Bethany House\nPublishers, 1985) pp. 31ff.

The definitive biography (and the only complete biography\nthat I have found) is Angus Kinnear's excellent work, Against the Tide. A much shorter\nsummary appears in Norman H. Cliff, \"Watchman Nee-- Church Planter and Preacher of\nHoliness,\" <i>Evangelical Review of Theology</i>, Vol.8 No. 2 (Oct. 1984).

Angus I. Kinnear, <i>Against the Tide: The Story\nof Watchman Nee</i>, pp. Cliff sees this period as a clear breech on Nee's part of his own\nteaching on church finance. However, he does not explain his reasoning, and I am more\ninclined to agree with Kinnear that it was in harmony with his teaching in <i>Concerning\nour Missions</i>. See Norman H. Cliff, \"Watchman Nee-- Church Planter and Preacher of\nHoliness,\" <i>Evangelical Review of Theology</i>, Vol.8 No. 2 (Oct. 1984):p. 294 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">32According to Chua Wee Hian, in one of the early episodes of migration evangelism,\nseventy families went into northwest China and thirty went into northeast China in 1930.\nHe says that these families had planted over 40 local churches by 1944.

Norman H. Cliff,\n\"Watchman Nee-- Church Planter and Preacher of Holiness,\" <i>Evangelical Review\nof Theology</i>, Vol. 8 No. 2 (Oct. 1984): p. 291. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">37Norman H.

He added that he dreaded \"those who agree and would use it as a\nmanual for service\" far more than \"those who oppose and would use it as a chart\nfor attack,\" p. 6. Ironically, just as he feared, this book has been used by Witness\nLee to substantiate his doctrine of \"Locality\". Although the book contains much\nthat is useful, the reader must remember that Nee was struggling with how to set up the\nchurch in China (which often had no existing churches in a given locality), not with how\nto reorganize American Christianity. See the critique of Nee's doctrine below. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">40Very early in Nee's career while still with a student group in Shanghai, he had shown\nhis unwillingness to compromise on these issues, \"Nee and Leland Wang clashed, the\nformer strongly opposing the need for ordination or for Christian workers to receive fixed\nsalaries. Nee was asked to discontinue fellowshipping with these Christians.\" Norman\nH. Cliff, \"Watchman Nee-- Church Planter and Preacher of Holiness,\" <i>Evangelical\nReview of Theology</i>, Vol.8 No. 2 (Oct. 1984): p. 290. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">41James Mo-Oi Cheung, <i>The Ecclesiology of the \"Little Flock\"</i> p. 6. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">42Norman H.

Nee actually advocates lying for\nthe sake of integrity! note p.104. In another incident, Nee refused to explain his own\nactions during the war (because he believed it was vainglorious to defend one's self when\nunder attack), and as a result, was thrown out of the church! Angus I. Kinnear, <i>Against\nthe Tide: The Story of Watchman Nee</i>, pp. 165-166. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">46For example Watchman Nee, <i>The Normal Christian Life</i>, (Wheaton, ILL: Tyndale\nHouse Publishers, Inc, 1957) p. 66 on \"reckon\" and numerous other vocabulary and\ntextual notes in the same work. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">47Angus I.

The statement was changed after 1931, and dropped the anti-rational portion.\nHowever, see his comment in 1948 that, \"We cannot dissect divine facts and outline\nand systematize them. It is only the immature Christian who demands always to have\nintellectually satisfying conclusions.\" Watchman Nee, <i>What Shall This Man Do? </i>(Fort\nWashington, Pennsylvania: Christian Literature Crusade, 1967), p. 8. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">52\"Spiritual inertia was never in fact a feature of the `little Flock' work. If\nsome groups. . . made Bible study their first exercise, most were very vigorous indeed in\ntheir evangelistic witness and outreach. They supported it too with imaginative follow-up\nof converts.\" Angus I. Kinnear, <i>Against the Tide: The Story of Watchman Nee</i>,\np. 156. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">53Cliff's attempt to divide Nee's teaching career up into three stages is not\nsuccessful in my mind. The influences that Cliff says were present later, such as Keswick,\nwere also present earlier. One wonders whether Cliff is not confusing different periods in\nNee's ministry with different translators and publishers of his sermons. These tend to\ncoincidentally follow a rough chronological correspondence-- the Little Flock group in New\nYork publishing the later sermons. Norman H. Cliff, \"Watchman Nee-- Church Planter\nand Preacher of Holiness,\" <i>Evangelical Review of Theology</i>, Vol.8 No. 2 (Oct.\n1984). </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">54Angus I. Kinnear, <i>Against the Tide: The Story of Watchman Nee</i>, p.81. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">55 See a ringing denunciation by Ranald McCauley and Jerram Barrs in <i>Being Human:\nThe Nature of Spiritual Experience</i>, (Downers Grove, ILL: Inter-Varsity Press, 1978)\npp. 44ff. with notes. What they call neo-platonism is actually neo-Chinese-ism. They also\nexaggerate and unfairly quote Nee, taking several of the statements cited out of context.\nThey fail to adequately explain why, if an inner man- outer man dichotomy is so bad, does\nPaul use the same language. It is clear that Nee's objectionable language is not coming\nfrom Plato at all, but from Romans 7, and IICorinthians 4. It is also quite clear that in\nseveral cases Nee's Chinese word for \"self-willed,\" or \"stubborn,\" is\ntranslated \"reason\". While I cannot speak to the translation issue involved, a\nstudy of the context in Release of the Spirit, and Normal Christian Worker, will confirm\nthat there is a translation difficulty, because the word \"reason\" is\nnon-sensical in context. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">56He said that Spiritual Man was too dogmatic and systematized, and that Concerning Our\nMissions was liable to distortion. See note # 27 above and Watchman Nee, <i>The Normal\nChristian Life</i>, (Wheaton, ILL: Tyndale House Publishers, Inc, 1957)p. . </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">57 Not a single audio tape or movie of Nee has surfaced. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">58Cliff and Kinnear both noticed this trend. Norman H. Cliff, \"Watchman Nee--\nChurch Planter and Preacher of Holiness,\" <i>Evangelical Review of Theology</i>,\nVol.8 No. 2 (Oct. 1984)pp.293,294 and Angus I. Kinnear, <i>Against the Tide: The Story of\nWatchman Nee</i>, pp. 180,181. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">59 Witness Lee has founded the `Local Church' movement, which according to Cliff, is\n\"exclusive and traveling a different doctrinal path to that of Nee.\" Norman H.\nCliff, \"Watchman Nee-- Church Planter and Preacher of Holiness,\" <i>Evangelical\nReview of Theology</i>, Vol.8 No. 2 (Oct. 1984), p. 295. However, Cheung fails to see this\ndistinction. He even thinks that Witness Lee can be studied in order to discover Nee's\nviews on ecclesiology. But this overlooks important differences, particularly in the area\nof ecclesiology. Lee took the mild tendency of Nee to allegorize Scripture to such radical\nextremes that little if anything of Nee can be learned from studying Lee. Even Cheung\nadmits that Lee's teaching on the kingdom is heretical. James Mo-Oi Cheung, <i>The\nEcclesiology of the \"Little Flock\"</i> p. 15. <br>\nOther off-shoots are not as radical. \"A group of assemblies formed by his colleague\nStephen Kaung on the east coast of the USA has been cooperative with all evangelical\ncauses, retaining the best elements in Nee's teaching.\" Norman H. Cliff,\n\"Watchman Nee-- Church Planter and Preacher of Holiness,\" <i>Evangelical Review\nof Theology</i>, Vol.8 No. 2 (Oct. 1984), p. 295. This author met Stephen Kaung in 1972.\nHe was a stirring speaker, deeply committed to the cause of Jesus Christ, but also seemed\nsomewhat legalistic and authoritarian. Again, these tendencies are not striking at all in\na Confucian society. <br>\nIn India, Bok Sing continues to lead a vigorous revival, but with some of the same\nshortcomings mentioned above. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">60Norman H.

Compare Liao, \"Nee led an\nindigenous Brethren Church movement which seemed at first an avowed rival to the\nestablished mission-related churches, but Nee's strong emphasis on evangelical doctrines\nand returning to biblical Christianity proved to be beneficial to all Chinese Christians.\nWorld Christianity: Eastern Asia Vol. 2 David C. E. Liao editor, (Monrovia, CA: Missions\nAdvanced Research and Communication Center, 1979) p. 42. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">65Cliff also points out that Nee's influence has been considerable outside of China,\nespecially in the Catholic Charismatic Movement, and the so-called \"shepherding\nmovement\" associated with Mumford and others. His books are also, according to Cliff,\nbeing studied regularly in mainline Churches in the USA, including Methodist, Lutheran,\nand Baptist churches. According to Enroth, Ericson, and Peters, the so-called \"Jesus\nMovement\", read Nee as on of their few extra-Biblical sources. Norman H.

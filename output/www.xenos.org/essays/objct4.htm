The tribes have a memory of a \"high god\", a benign creator-father-god,\n  who is no longer worshiped because he is not feared. Instead of offering sacrifice to him,\n  they concern themselves with the pressing problems of how to appease the vicious spirits\n  of the jungle. The threats of the medicine man are more strident than the still, small\n  voice of the father-god.\"35 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Following this original concept, these scholars see a gradual takeover of religious\nlife in this culture by a caste of self-serving priests. These professional religionists\nuse conceptions that were somewhat germane to human inclinations in general to gain\ninfluence and eventually complete control of the religious life (and sometimes the\npolitical life) of the society.36 </p>\n\n<p>Scholars writing from this perspective have not generally focused on the <i>method </i>of\npriestly takeover, but rather on the fact of it. Yet, one thing that is regularly cited in\ndemonstration of the fact of priestly takeover and corruption is the <i>objectification </i>of\nthe given religion. This in turn is seen as a link to magical motifs.37 </p>\n\n<p>We have already seen the deep affinity that mankind the world over has for systems that\nprovide for containment, regularization and control of the sacred. As Budge points out, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Men have always craved for amulets and the priests, both Pagans and Christians,\n  should have taken steps to satisfy this craving. In this way they could have more or less\n  controlled the use of amulets of every kind.\"38 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems that Budge has missed the point here. Priests have \"taken measures\"\nto satisfy the craving for amulets, to control their use, and even to better the\nprotection offered by conventional amulets. The struggle between priests and magicians has\nusually been one between the right or wrong amulets, not between amulets and no amulets.\nBudge himself admits that the formalized religions of the world retained the use of magic\nand amulets.39 He also demonstrates that Christianity has been no different than other\nreligions in this area.40 </p>\n\n<p>The final phase of development, according to the corruption theorists, is a revolt by a\nnew religious group against the control of the priests. Brow states,\"In the sixth\ncentury BC there was a tidal wave of revolt against the priestcraft of the ancient world.\nThis wave shattered the power of the old religions, though their cults continued to exist\nas backwaters for centuries. Seven world religions appeared within fifty years of each\nother and all continue to this day: Zoroastrianism, Judaism,(sic) Buddhism, Jainism,\nConfucianism, Vedanta Monism, Taoism.\"41 </p>\n\n<p>Yet, even these revolutionary religions, it is held, are eventually taken over by a\npriesthood using cultus and magical elements to secure power for themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Theory 5: The Cognitive Restructuring Theory</h3>\n\n<p>Another interesting approach to the task of understanding objectification, particularly\nin the area of the use of ritual and sacred space, is the cognitive restructuring theory\nadvanced by Dr. Anthony Wallis. </p>\n\n<p>Wallis holds that the role of sacred space is to be found in two distinct steps found\nin the ritualism of all religions.42 According to Wallis, the goal of ritualism is the\nrestructuring of the mind through the use of stimuli and suggestion, resulting in a new\n\"cognitive synthesis.\" There are five steps involved in the process of cognitive\nrestructuring: \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li>First comes the step called <b>\"Prelearning.\"</b> He says that the,\n    \"elements to be reorganized in the new cognitive synthesis must be already present as\n    a result of previous learning.\"43 </li>\n  <li>Next comes a very interesting stage called <b>\"Separation.\" </b>The ritualist\n    separates himself from normal \"profane\" living by one or more of several\n    possible means. These means include \"deprivation of sensory contact with previously\n    significant features of the environment through such devices as physical isolation,\n    darkness, distracting noise...the use of drugs...the imposition of extreme physical\n    stress...which restricts attention...by the presentation of monotonous and repetitive\n    stimuli,...which produce a trance.\" It is important to see that he is not suggesting\n    that the worshiper is necessarily unconscious, as he explains,\"...the degree of\n    separation of attention achieved by these methods can vary greatly- from the probably\n    minor effect of simple withdrawal to a quiet, \"sacred\" place to the profoundly\n    dissociative effect of drugs, complete sensory deprivation, extreme stress, or prolonged\n    drumming--all these procedures seem to have the effect of facilitating cognitive\n    restructuring.\"44 </li>\n  <li>The third stage is called, <b>\"Suggestion.\" </b>Having reached an altered\n    (dissociated) state, \"the cognitive materials relevant to resynthesis can be readily\n    recombined under the influence of direct suggestion...\" This suggestion can originate\n    either from prelearning (as in the case of plains Indian vision quests), or from a\n    religious functionary, or guide, who is present for the occasion. If neither of these are\n    present, there can be a \"spontaneous sorting out of dissociated elements...\"\n    There may be a temporary, or even a permanent change in mood, or other personality traits\n    (as in possession phenomena, or ritual ecstasies) during the process of resynthesis. </li>\n  <li>Next comes <b>\"Execution.\" </b>After achieving resynthesis, \"the ritual\n    subject will be expected, sooner or later, to act in accordance with the new cognitive\n    structure...\" </li>\n  <li>Finally there is the phase called <b>\"Maintenance.\" </b>In cases of ritual\n    possession,\"...the individual apparently retains a lower threshold for dissociation\n    and personality alteration.\" In some instances, the maintenance \"...depends on\n    post-hypnotic suggestion.\" In cases where lasting change is sought, it is necessary\n    \"...either to renew, periodically, the ritual itself, or to provide the subject with\n    tangible cues from the ritual experience which will serve to maintain the new\n    structure...such as amulets, talismans and medicine bundles...special ornaments and\n    uniforms, and by public symbols (like the cross).\"45Thus, it is suggested that sacred\n    space plays an important role in facilitating the process of separation (or dissociation).\n    It does so by virtue of the fact that the temple, shrine, church or whatever is set up in\n    such a way that it creates a sense of \"differentness\" which leads to a feeling\n    of altered consciousness. A dark atmosphere is preferred, and there must be clear\n    distinctions in architecture. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This sense is further enhanced by other elements common to objectification such as\nincense, unusual clerical robes, monotonous bodily gestures, and the almost universal use\nof highly repetitive sayings, or chanting. </p>\n\n<p>Not only this, but we find the role of sacred objects and magic play an important role,\naccording to Wallis, in the maintenance of the restructured mental outlook. This is an\ninteresting interpretation, suggesting that \"portable sacred space\" can be taken\nwith the worshipper to prolong the effects. </p>\n\n<p>This analysis, which is not flattering to the ritualistic mentality, has the advantage\nof being applicable to most, if not all ritual practice. It also accounts in a plausible\nway for many of the hard to explain features that are so common to religious practice the\nworld over.46</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Ask Dennis a question or share\na comment.</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/objct_a.htm\">Go back to the Objectification table of contents</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\">Go back to the Essays page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/objct5.htm\">Read on to the next section in \"Objectification\"</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Go back to the Xenos home page</a> </p>\n\n<p>Send Dennis a comment or question  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Objectification Of Religion:\nUniversal Themes IV","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/objct4.htm"}

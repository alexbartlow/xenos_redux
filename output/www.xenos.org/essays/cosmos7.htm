The concept of nature (with a\nsmall \"n\") represents the view of a world which is characterized by an\nempirically accessible set of ordered properties, behavior patterns, and cause-effect\nrelationships. Nature (with a capital \"N\") is an early Greek, quasireligious\nconcept which holds that nature is not merely ordered but it is also autonomous or\nself-ordered. This quasireligious concept was introduced by the Ionian\n\"physikoi\" in an attempt to depersonalize the Olympian myths of ancient Greece.\nThus Nature became invested with some attributes normally reserved for deity, such as\neternalness, autonomy, and necessity.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos7.htm#Footnote1B\" name=\"Footnote1A\">Footnote1</a>\nThe philosophical interpretation of nature with a capital \"N\" is often found\nembedded in scientific and naturalistic interpretations of events. Scientific cosmology\nusually speaks of nature with a capital \"N\". Biblical cosmology regards nature\nto be characterized by the view represented with a small \"n\".</p>\n\n<p>The problem of whether the universe is self-ordered or externally governed gives rise\nto the question; How does one define the boundary, if it exists, between natural and\nsupernatural processes? Furthermore, how do we determine whether the \"laws of\nnature\" are natural or supernatural in origin? A common view is; if the supernatural\nexists then it must cause natural events to behave in a way that is inconsistent with\nnaturalistic explanations. In the Christian view God is sustained in addition to designer\nand creator. This view may be expressed by defining natural laws as physical descriptions\nof God's normal activity. Thus one possible definition of the supernatural/natural\nboundary might be the fundamental natural laws. These laws represent axiomatic assertions\nthat can not be further reduced to other statements of the behavior of the physical world\nnor is there any physical explanation of either their necessity or origin. If the universe\nis self-ordered rather than externally ordered then the natural laws appear to have been\nboot strapped into existence or must be self-existent, eternal principles. If they were\nboot-strapped into existence through some interactive feedback with the formation of\nmatter then the principle of uniformity (the belief that the laws of nature are the same\nthroughout the universe) would seem to be a very peculiar state of affairs. </p>\n\n<p>Although science has the competence to study the physical behavior of matter, it does\nnot (by its choice of methodology) have the ability to determine whether that behavior is\nself-governed or supernaturally-governed. The belief that nature is God-governed with\nrespect to the behavior of physical phenomena is a belief that goes beyond the limited\ndomain of scientific inquiry.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos7.htm#Footnote2B\" name=\"Footnote2A\">Footnote2</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Temporal or Eternal<b> </b></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically the universe has been regarded by philosophers and scientists as eternally\nself-existent. Scientific cosmologies represented by the steady state and oscillating\nuniverse theories are modern attempts to salvage this view. However the general acceptance\nof the Big Bang theory, representing the universe as having a one time beginning, seems to\nhave provided a consensus view that the universe is temporal and not eternally\nself-existent.</p>\n\n<p>Stephan Hawking tries to side-step this conclusion by postulating that the universe is\nthe result of a vacuum fluctuation. Thus energy is seen as eternally self-existent. The\nappearance of a vacuum is just the condition that is satisfied when negative and positive\nenergy are perfectly balanced. What appears to be the creative event of the universe then\nbecomes a quantum mechanical instability that spontaneously occurred causing the energy\nbalance to be disrupted. The energy thereby released then transformed itself into the\nuniverse as we now know it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Creation or Formation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Naive fundamentalism tends to view God commanding by fiat, creating instantaneously,\nproducing miracles that stand in contradiction or opposition to 'natural' phenomena. These\nclaims are not so much false as they are terribly misleading when accompanied by claims\nimplying that they are exclusive or normative modes of Gods interaction with the world.\nSuch a view denies the importance God has attached to human agency and His actions through\nprocess (e.g., history). Human agency and process are both attested to by the biblical\nrecord of God's interactions with the world. </p>\n\n<p>In biblical cosmology there is a view of creation in which the object of creation\ninstantaneously pops into existence in its final mature form. Is there any biblical\nevidence to support such a concept? There is little indication that such a view can be\nsupported. If it can be supported what is our evidential reference? One evidential basis\nwould be the character of other divine actions.</p>\n\n<p>Let us consider the revelation of God's word and His incarnation as two examples of how\nGod acts. The bible itself did not immediately pop into existence but was the product of\nconsiderable history. The scriptures did not magically appear on golden tablets but were\nwritten in the context of an extended historical process. Likewise, Christ did not pop\ninto existence fully mature and available for immediate execution but entered the world,\nat least from all 'outward biological appearances', in much the same way as the rest of us\n(i.e., a child, born of a woman although admittedly his conception was unique).</p>\n\n<p>If something so important and urgent to God and man as Christianity, so to speak\n'evolved' from history over several thousand years, why is there any expectation that the\nuniverse or man were not created through temporally extended processes as well? Thus we\ncan find no sound basis for believing formation is antithetical to creation. Formation is\nsimply a temporally extended process that may well include creative activity but it in no\nway excludes it. Formation is not equivalent to physical determinism.</p>\n\n<p>In theological interpretations of the Old and New Testament biblical accounts of\ncreation of the universe the term creatio ex nihilo is frequently used. At this point in\nthe discussion it will be useful to discuss the meaning and origin of this term as well as\ncontrasting views. There are three contrasting views concerning creation:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x95; <i><b>Creatio Ex Nihilo</b></i>; creation out of nothing, a theological view\nderived from biblical statements concerning creation and sometimes associated with the Big\nBang theory;</p>\n\n<p>&#x95; <b><i>Creatio Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit</i></b>; nothing is made out of nothing, a\nmaterialists view of the cosmos and associated with the older static universe cosmologies;</p>\n\n<p>&#x95; <b><i>Creatio Continua</i></b>; continuous creation, a theological view also\nclaiming to have a biblical basis from the point of view that God has continued his\ncreative acts which were not confined to a particular point in time, and also borrowed by\nmaterialists (minus any theistic reference) in attempts to revitalize the steady state\ntheory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creatio ex nihilo is not explicitly stated in the scriptures although it is implied.\nThe doctrine of creatio ex nihilo was espoused as a refutation of other mythical\ncosmologies and as a counter argument to certain dualisms that regarded physical creation\nas inherently evil. The Greek claims regarding Nature as co-eternal with the divine\nencouraged the development of a doctrine of creation with a central focus on creatio ex\nnihilo.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos7.htm#Footnote3B\" name=\"Footnote3A\">Footnote3</a> According to Barbour<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos7.htm#Footnote4B\" name=\"Footnote4A\">Footnote4</a> the church historian Jaroslav Pelikan\nin \"Creation and Causality in the History of Christian Thought\" points out that\ncreatio ex nihilo may be implied in the Old Testament but its first explicit appearance is\nin the intertestamental period (2Macc. 7:28). In the New Testament it appears in just two\npassages (Rom. 4:17 and Heb. 11:3). </p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Rom 4:17</b> (as it is written, \"A FATHER OF MANY NATIONS HAVE I MADE\nYOU\") in the sight of Him whom he believed, even God, who gives life to the dead and\ncalls into being that which does not exist.</p>\n\n<p><b>Heb 11:3</b> By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of\nGod, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pelikan shows that the idea of ex nihilo was developed post-biblically as a defense of\nthe goodness of the world and the absolute sovereignty of God against Gnostic ideas\nregarding matter as evil or as the product of an inferior deity. Jacob (Theology of the\nOld Testament) says that some texts imply creation is a completed process but other texts,\ngenerally more ancient, draw much less distinction between creation and conservation of\nthe world. This leads to the idea of creatio continua. Thus continuing creation stood in\nopposition of ex nihilo creation. Pelikan traces the subordination of continuous to\ninstantaneous creation through the Middle Ages, Reformation, and Enlightenment and\nconcludes that neglect of continuing creation has made it difficult to interpret evolution\nas the means of creation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\"Something More\" or \"Nothing But\"<b> </b></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Scientific cosmologies describe formation mechanisms. The fallacy of reductive\nmaterialism occurs when the philosophical assertion is made that there is no underlying\npurpose to the mechanism or equating explanatory mechanisms of operation or formation with\nself-existent attributes. For example Barbour points out that at the lowest level,\nmechanical explanation of an automobile's operation does not rule out recognition of </p>\n\n\n\n<p>(a) its coordinated functioning (where function refers to the contribution of the parts\nto the integrated activity of the whole), or</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(b) the purposes of the human designer who planned such functioning. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand the Christian must guard against 'God of the Gaps' tendencies when\ncountering this fallacy. Here we must seriously consider that it is precisely the\noperation of fundamental natural laws in the formation processes, not their violation,\nwhich has brought about the intended result, and thereby displayed God's purpose in\ncreation. As with the operation of the automobile there would be no 'gaps' in the\nscientific account of operation.</p>\n\n<p>It must be kept in mind as pointed out by Henri Poincare,<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos7.htm#Footnote5B\" name=\"Footnote5A\">Footnote5</a> \"Every conclusion supposes premises: these premises\nthemselves either are self-evident and need no demonstration, or can be established only\nby relying upon other propositions, and since we can not go back thus to infinity, every\ndeductive science, ..., must rest on a certain number of undemonstratable axioms.\"\nWhen it is stated that science has refuted arguments for theistic supernaturalism this can\nusually be attributed to the fallacy of reductionism (the conclusion that a mechanical\ndescription of composition completely and totally defines the reality of the object\ndescribed).</p>\n\n<p>Frequently this fallacy is committed because of unintentionally or deceptively hidden\npresuppositions. Extreme presuppositionalism leads to Creation Science, Atheism,\nNaturalism and possibly any other 'ism one can presuppose. Extreme presuppositionalism\nassumes that the presuppositions do not merely influence but actually dominate the\ninterpretation of data. Unless one accepts that science or theology, while both are\nvulnerable to presuppositionalism, is self correcting with the collection of sufficient\ndata and continued attempts to reconcile the data with theory, data, observation, and\nexperience, then all beliefs, both scientific and religious, become essentially fideistic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos7.htm#Footnote1A\" name=\"Footnote1B\">Footnote1</a></p>\n\n<p>Howard J.

While religious systems differ not only in different countries, but in the same\n  country in different ages, the system of sympathetic magic remains everywhere and at all\n  times substantially alike in its principles and practice.\"21 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although most scholars would probably still agree with Frazer on this point, today many\nfeel that he was wrong in his attempt to differentiate between magic and objectified\nreligion. In a book that is still useful, though not recent, Haddon brought to light many\nof the key elements found in magic and fetishism the world over. In it we find the\nfollowing interesting observation: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"There arises in the region of human thought a powerful impulse to objectify, and\n  even personify, the mysterious or 'supernatural' something felt; and in the region of\n  will, a corresponding impulse to render it innocuous, or better still, propitious, by\n  force of constraint, communion, or conciliation.\"22 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yet, this statement, so similar to several made by Norbeck and Eliade, is not referring\nto formalized religion, but to fetishism! Indeed, in this case, the localization of the\ndeity is in terms of an object rather than a temple or shrine. Yet, we are still dealing\nwith sacred space. </p>\n\n<p>To those reluctant to understand a fetish or a spirit trap as sacred space, we pose the\nquestion, \"Why should we draw a dividing line between an object twenty inches across,\nand a shrine 200 inches across?\" Is not the difference here one of amount rather than\none of substance? </p>\n\n<p>In another passage, Haddon defines a fetish. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"A fetish is credited with mysterious powers owing to its being the habitation,\n  temporary or permanent, of a spiritual being.\"23 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is a great similarity between the way oral cultures view a fetish, and the way\nmany literate peoples view a temple or a shrine. What meaningful distinction can, or\nshould be made between the sacred space recognized in fetishism, and that recognized in\nobjectified religion? The \"house of god\" motif so well known in western religion\nseems almost identical to these notions of sacred space. Further still, Eliade points out\nthat, \"...the rocks, springs, caves and woods venerated from the earliest historic\ntimes are still, in different forms, held as sacred by Christian communities\ntoday.\"24 </p>\n\n<p>Some western thinkers are reluctant to admit the presence of an outlook for so long\nconsidered \"primitive\" in the heart of western culture. In a book containing\nmuch useful insight, although largely considered outdated in its basic interpretation\ntoday, Frazer says, \"...an Age of Religion has thus everywhere, as I venture to\nsurmise, been preceded by an Age of Magic...\" 25 </p>\n\n<p>However, Frazer seems to be speaking more from cultural bias than from objective\nevidence. Parrinder denounces Frazer's view: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Sir James Frazer called magic a primitive science and said that it came at the\n  early stages, before religion. There is no evidence for the latter assumption. Religious\n  and magical beliefs are intertwined at most stages of culture, and indeed a case be made\n  out for banning the word magic and including it all, however crude, under the heading of\n  religion; for these strange practices all depend upon spiritual conceptions and largely\n  work by faith.\"26 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It may be argued at this point that the theology of some religions have no explicit\nunderstanding that the deity(s) indwell a holy place. However, there is still ample\nsimilarity with so-called more primitive magical outlooks, because even fetishism\nsometimes views the object as \"merely the vehicle or means by which the spirit\ncommunicates with his worshipers.\"27 Thus even those theologies that have no concept\nof the deity(s) literally dwelling within the sacred space idea hole that the space is a\n\"vehicle of communication.\"28 </p>\n\n<p>We find then that notions which have been common to pre-literate cultures the world\nover are very similar, if not identical to some of the forces present in the process of\nobjectification of religion. Observations such as these lead scholars like Norbeck to\ncomment, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Sacred objects of the great civilizations differ not at all in their general\n  nature from those of primitive societies. Protective talismans, many uses of the cross,\n  holy water, and the sacrament may all be objectively viewed as implying power which,\n  although interpreted as bestowed or derived from a man-like deity, become the qualities of\n  the acts or objects themselves.\"29 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here Norbeck truly points out that objects and actions are invested with spiritual\nqualities in the major religions today in precisely the same way that the so-called\nprimitive fetishist or magician does. Perhaps this is a workable framework within which to\nunderstand objectification of religion; not a further development of the major religions,\nbut a return to a way of thinking and believing that is as old as man himself. 30 </p>\n\n<p>Haddon bluntly agrees that, \". . .it is difficult to point out where fetishism\nends and nature-worship, ancestor-worship, totemism, polytheism, and idolatry begin, or to\ndistinguish between a fetish, an idol, and a deity.31 Here are scholars reaching the same\nconclusion we have already suggested--that objectified religion and magic are very\ndifficult to differentiate. </p>\n\n<p>One might wonder why, if these notions are so similar, don't oral societies have\nformalized structures like those we are familiar with in the modern west? Where are the\ntemples of the non-literate peoples today? </p>\n\n<p>In answer to this question Parrinder says, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Building in stone is unknown to most illiterate peoples, either through lack of\n  soft stone in their territory or more commonly because the necessary techniques are\n  absent. Hence there are no great temples, monuments of the past, such as we find\n  everywhere among the literary religions.\"32 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although there are temples to be found in pre-literate societies, they often do not\nplay the prominent role that they do in literate societies. Yet this may only be a\nreflection of a difference in technology, not a difference in the basic way of thinking\nabout the divine. </p>\n\n<p>Having broached the subject of temples, it is interesting to note here yet another\nclear connection between magic and objectification of religion. Many, and perhaps most of\nthe great cathedrals, temples, mosques, pagodas, and other shrines the world over, are\nactually built around a part of a human body. Whether some hair, bones, breast milk, teeth\nor the whole body of a saint, the shrine receives its identity and, we must suppose, some\nof its sacredness, from the presence of part of a dead saint's body. After all, the temple\nor sanctuary is \"consecrated\" at the same time the body part is introduced to\nthe altar in Islam, Catholicism, some Hindu sects and Theravada Buddhism. </p>\n\n<p>Students of oral societies recognize this practice as a form of contagious magic called\nexuvial magic. Norbeck explains, \"...exuvial magic...involves the use of human\nexuvaie, hair combings, teeth, nail clippings, excreta, spittle, placentae, and the\numbilici of new-born infants.\"34 </p>\n\n<p>Exuvial magic is a form of contagious magic, where practitioners believe the exuvaie\nwill transmit some of the characteristics of the saint. Therefore we see again a striking\nparallel between objectification (especially connected with the area of sacred space) and\nsupposed early ideas of contagious magic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/objct_a.htm\">Go back to the Objectification table of contents</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Ask Dennis a question or\nshare a comment.</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\">Go back to the Essays page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/objct4.htm\">Read on to the next section in \"Objectification\"</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Go back to the Xenos home page</a> </p>\n\n<p>Send Dennis a comment or question  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Objectification Of Religion:\nUniversal Themes III","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/objct3.htm"}

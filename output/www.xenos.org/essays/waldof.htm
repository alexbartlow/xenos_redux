Biller shows that the rite of entry to the\nbrotherhood included the \"profession of the three monastic vows. . .greater\nstrictness [than other mendicant orders] . . .a requirement of virginity, not just\ncelibacy in a candidate, automatic expulsion for a sexual lapse, a longer period of\nprobation after profession of vows, twelve years in one case. . .\" Peter Biller,\n\"Multum Ieiunantes et se Castigantes: Medieval Waldensian Asceticism\" in <em>Monks,\nHermits and the Ascetic Tradition: Papers read at the 1984 Summer Meeting and the 1985\nWinter Meeting of the Ecclesiastical History Society</em>, (London: Basil Blackwell, 1985)\npp. 218,219.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>36See a concise analysis of Asceticism based on the writings of Augustine in Henry\nChadwick, \"The Ascetic Ideal in the History of the Church,\" in <em>Monks Hermits\nand the Ascetic Tradition</em>, pp. 1-23. This period was formative for the history of\nasceticism in the church, because the overwhelming influx of so-called\n\"converts\" after Constantine was threatening to erase the distinction between\nChristian and pagan. In the face of social pressure to become Christian, millions were\njoining the church without having been converted. Thus, in addition to the dualistic\nreasons for asceticism (suspicion of the material world) there was the effort to put\ndistance between one's self and the nominal Christians (see pp. 8-9).</big></p>\n\n<p><big>37James Doyne Dawson, \"Richard Fitzralph and the Fourteenth-Century Poverty\nControversy,\" <em>Journal of Ecclesiastical History</em>, Vol. 34, #3 (Jul. 1983) p.\n317.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>38Eschatological, because concerned with making it to heaven (see note 38 below).\nHowever, the other ascetic orders also were concerned with making it to heaven.

Pius Melia, D. D., <em>The Origin, Persecutions, and Doctrines of the\nWaldenses</em>, p. 93,98. However, this conclusion seems unwarranted. The Waldensians\ndefinitely rejected the existence of purgatory during the early period, and claimed that\nit was foreign to the scriptures. Yet this doctrine is clearly rooted in the Apocraphal\nliterature.&#xA0; They also argued that there was nothing anyone could do once a person\ndied, as can be seen from the following early record of the Inquisition.</big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>\". . .one who does good will go to paradise, and one who does evil will go to\n    hell and damnation; purgatory does not exist. Indeed, whoever believes in purgatory is\n    condemned already. Further, charities after one's death should not be done, for charities\n    after death have no value; that they do not profit the one who does them if they are not\n    done before death. . .\" \"Interrogation of Filippo Regis\" at his trial in\n    1451, published by G.

There is no statement in any Waldensian writing affirming the cannonicity of\nthe Apocrapha. These books, like the writings of the fathers (which are also found in\nWaldensian translation) were apparently used as supplemental material, as indeed they were\nso viewed by most of the Roman Catholic Church during this period. </big></p>\n\n<p><big><a name=\"41\">41</a>The established orders of monasteries were obtaining great\nwealth during this period. See Bainton's insight that when reaching new areas during a\ntime when currency was worthless, only a self-supporting monastery was in a position to\nsurvive. Later, as land was donated, the serfs were donated along with it. The monks would\naccept the serfs, and so became land major lords. \"Altogether they were the most\nenterprising businessmen of their day.\" Roland Bainton, \"The Ministry in the\nMiddle Ages,\" in <em>The Ministry In Historical Perspective</em>, H. Richard Niebuhr\nand Daniel D.

One only has to compare the church in 350\nAD to the church in Acts to realize how much things may have changed in such a long\nperiod. Peter Biller, \"Multum Ieiunantes et se Castigantes: Medieval Waldensian\nAsceticism\" in <em>Monks, Hermits and the Ascetic Tradition</em>, p. 223. When taking\nconfession, \"their penance was heavier than that imposed by the priests in the\nChurch.\" For instance, they demanded \"fasting one or two days a week for a year\nor several years\" for excessive love-making with one's wife or husband (p. 226). </big></p>\n\n<p><big>44The reason for the rejection of Waldo is given as his ignorance. Yet, Francis\nwas not rejected. Of course, there were different popes involved, and the church had the\nexperience of the Waldensians to reflect on at the time of Francis. I think the only\nvisible difference of importance was the fact that Waldo had the Bible translated.\nTherefore, when the Poor of Lyons preached, it was with a Bible in their hands in the\nvernacular. This was probably a level of authority too threatening to tolerate.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>45Edward Peters ed., <em>Heresy and Authority in Medieval Europe: Documents in\nTranslation</em>, (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1980) p. 140.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>46In the year 1180, Henri de Marcy, the Pontifical Delegate, was in southern\nFrance to organize a campaign against the Cathari, and there encountered Waldo. He called\non Waldo to sign a statement of adherence to the Roman Catholic faith, and without\nhesitation he did so.

Tourn adds that the Waldensians struck a chord with the tone of northern Italian\npiety. The Pateria were very receptive to the Waldensians in this region. They also met\nsome of the followers of Arnold of Brescia, the disciple of Abelard, who had travelled all\nover Europe making the acquaintance of various dissident groups and had even started a\npopular movement in Rome. It was Arnold who first advanced the notion of a complete\nseparation between religious and political powers.\" Giorgio Tourn, <em>The\nWaldensians</em>, pp. 15,16. It is in the addition of the North Italian dissidents that\nthe Waldensians could claim some pre-existence. There had been resistance to Papal claims\nin this area for some time, but it was not based on evangelical doctrine, as some\nprotestant writers assert.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>54This tenet led to added persecution in a day when fealty oaths were the basis of\nsociety. The Waldensians were outside the law, because they refused to swear allegiance to\nanyone. Some Inquisitors claimed that they were allowed to swear a limited number of oaths\nunder torture in order to save themselves and others. Bernard Gui, \"Manuel de\nl'Inquisiteur\", in Jeffrey Burton Russell, <em>Religious Dissent in the Middle Ages</em>,\npp. 51,52.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>55Pius Melia, D.D., <em>The Origin, Persecutions, and Doctrines of the Waldenses</em>,\npp. 101-129. This section of Melia's book has been copied for viewing at Xenos Fellowship\noffice. It not only cites several original Waldensian and inquisitorial documents for each\npoint in the original and in translation, but in addition, each doctrine mentioned is\nanswered from the Roman Catholic point of view. Melia cites the scriptural and \"de\nfide\" documents with references that set forth the Roman Catholic position on each\npoint. Such a defense is unusual and hard to find, especially in such condensed form.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>56According to Tourn, \". . .in Waldensian thinking one cardinal point had\nstood out from the beginning: an insistence on a clear separation between the civil power\nand the exercise of religion. . .\" Giorgio Tourn, <em>The Waldensians</em>, p. 70.\nThis idea seems to also underlie numerous claims by inquisitors that the Waldensians\nrejected the authority of all earthly princes. It is likely that they were actually\nrejecting the right of secular rulers to lead pogroms supposedly based on religion. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>57A typical witness to this view is Raymond de Costa's description of a Waldensian\neucharist, </big><br>\n<big>\". . .bless, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, this bread, this\nfish, [a distinctive Waldensians addition] and this wine, not as a sacrifice and offering,\nbut as a simple commemoration of the most holy supper which Jesus Christ our Lord\ninstituted. . .,\" From the \"Testimony of Raymond de Costa at his trial in\n1320,\" published by J.

Giorgio Tourn, <em>The Waldensians</em>, p. 50, 51. One of the\nstatements in a document called, \"Waldo's statement of Faith\", dated by Tourn\n1180 is, \"We believe also that anyone in this age who keeps to a proper life, giving\nalms and doing other good works from his own possessions and observing the precepts from\nthe Lord, can be saved.\" p. 14.

He also warns that not all\nreferences to Waldensians are to be believed, \"heretical tendencies of every sort\nwere called `Waldensian.' One remembers that Joan of Arc was condemned for her\n'Waldensianism.' In the Index of the Flemish Church, Waldensian meant a mysterious\ncharacter, close to the world of witches and sorcerers, worshipers of the devil and\npractitioners of black magic. Fascination with this view has rewarded us with verbal\naccounts by inquisitors and also some remarkable miniatures by Flemish artists, such as\nthose picturing Waldensians flying on brooms or participating in the nightly excursions\nand dances of witches.\" p. 40, 41 He also produces a plate of one of the broom flying\npictures on after p. 46. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>69Giorgio Tourn, <em>The Waldensians</em>, p. 66.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>70The practice of calling their leaders \"uncles\" stemmed from the desire\nto literally obey the command in the gospels to \"call no man father. . .[or]\nteacher\" (Mt. 23:8-10), and because the term was deceptive and helped keep secret who\ntheir leaders were. </big></p>\n\n<p><big><a name=\"71\">71</a>Giorgio Tourn, <em>The Waldensians</em>, p. 59,60.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>72Giorgio Tourn, <em>The Waldensians</em>, p. 64,65. There were also other\nincidents of violence, though few in number. \". . . the Waldensians assassinated the\ninquisitors Peter of Verona and Conrad of Marburg; we know also that not a few priests in\nBohemia who were caught up in the repression there came to the same end.\"(p. 48).</big></p>\n\n<p><big>73Giorgio Tourn, <em>The Waldensians</em>, p. 64 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>74Giorgio Tourn, <em>The Waldensians</em>, p. 69</big></p>\n\n<p><big>75Quoted in Jan Milic Lochman, \"Not Just One Reformation: The Waldensian and\nHussite Heritage.\" <em>Reformed World</em>, Vol. 33, No. 5 (Mar. 75) p. 221.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>76Cameron thinks that this Synod was not an orderly meeting as Tourn suggests, but\na series of discussions between various clusters of Waldensians and Reformed over a period\nof time, perhaps punctuated by one major meeting.

He admits that such a meeting did occur, and\nthat the outcome was as claims, but he refers to it as the \"The myth of\nChanforan.\" Euan Cameron, <em>The Reformation of the Heretics: The Waldenses of the\nAlps, 1480-1580</em>, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984) pp.138-144.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>77The Waldensians agreed.

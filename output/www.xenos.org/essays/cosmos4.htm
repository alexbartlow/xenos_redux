This view is\nexpressed by Carl Sagan<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos4.htm#Footnote1B\" name=\"Footnote1A\">Footnote1</a>, \"The\nCosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be.\" A cosmology that postulates an\neternal universe avoids the philosophical and theological question of \"Why does the\nuniverse exist?\" and \"How did the universe come into being?\". If an object\nis self-existent the questions hold no meaning. An eternal universe also provides the\nlarge time or large number of trials to yield the necessary order to produce life by\nprocesses governed by chance. The essential tenet of this view is that the world as we\nknow it is only one of many possibilities that occurred by accident (devoid of purpose or\ndesign). For the particular possibility that we know as reality to have occurred by random\nnatural processes requires either an exceptionally lucky occurrence, long time periods for\nthings to have evolved into their present state, or many previous events. The steady state\nmodel provides the long time period, and the oscillating universe provides the many\nprevious events. The steady state model is philosophically similar to Aristotle's view of\nthe universe as having always existed and always existing essentially in its present\ncondition with respect to the existence of matter. The oscillating universe model is\nphilosophically similar to Plato's idea of an eternal but changing universe.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos4.htm#Footnote2B\" name=\"Footnote2A\">Footnote2</a></p>\n\n<p>The Standard \"Big Bang\" Model is philosophically similar to the view of\ncreation ex nihilo, although, there is much controversy concerning the interpretation of\nthis model regarding statements about the actual origin of the universe. While the Big\nBang Model is compatible with the biblical account of the cosmos as having a beginning it\ndoes not provide a 'knock-down' proof of biblical creation nor can a natural theology be\nderived from the model. The religious significance of the model is that it lends\nscientific support to a universe with a beginning and the possibility of ex nihilo\ncreation. However there are also naturalistic interpretations of the theory and there is\nconsiderable uncertainty whether the big bang occurred in time or marked the beginning of\ntime. A time line of the major events in the formation of the universe according to the\nBig Bang cosmological model is given in Figure 1. Very shortly after the Big Bang event\nand before approximately 10-43 seconds has expired the laws of physics change. Prior to\nthis time gravity affected all processes. Before 10-12 seconds had elapsed there was grand\nunification. That is there were no distinctions between the four fundamental types of\nforces (gravity, weak nuclear, electromagnetic, and strong nuclear force). After one\nhundred thousand years nucleosynthesis had occurred in which elements were formed by the\nprocess of atomic combinations of neutrons and protons. After ten billion years galaxies\nformed followed by formation of the sun and planets of our solar system. Fifteen billion\nyears after the Big Bang brings us to the present life on earth.</p>\n\n<p><br>\n<img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/larry1.gif\" alt=\"larry1.gif (2715 bytes)\" width=\"485\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Although the Big Bang cosmology does not explicitly contain a metaphysical assertion of\na creation event it is compatible with the idea. However, as noted by Adolf Grunbaum,<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos4.htm#Footnote3B\" name=\"Footnote3A\">Footnote3</a> the idea of creation is laden with the\nnotion of a creating agency or cause external to the created objects, and the presumed\nbeginning of the universe a finite time ago tends to suggest, in some quarters, the\noperation of a creator. The English astronomer Sir Bernard Lovell has given an explicitly\ntheological twist to the most fundamental cosmological question by making two major\nclaims: (1) there is an inescapable problem of creation in both the steady state and big\nbang cosmologies, but neither of them is capable of offering a scientific solution to it;\nand (2) a satisfactory explanatory solution 'must eventually move over into metaphysics'\nby postulating divine creation. Claiming that one can meaningfully speak of 'the time\nbefore the big bang,' Lovell reasons that: \"One must still inquire ... how the\nprimeval gas of the big bang originated. Science has nothing to say on this issue.\"\nThe English physicist C. J. Isham wrote: \"Perhaps the best argument in favor of the\nthesis that the Big Bang supports theism is the obvious unease with which it is greeted by\nsome atheist physicists. At times this has led to scientific ideas, such as continuous\ncreation or an oscillating universe, being advanced with a tenacity which so exceeds their\nintrinsic worth that one can only suspect the operation of psychological forces lying very\nmuch deeper than the usual academic desire of a theorist to support his/her theory.\"\nThe advocacy of an oscillating universe by the atheistic British physicist W. Bonner is a\ncase in point, since Bonner rejected a big bang model featuring a finite past in the\nbelief that it lends support to divine creation. John Maddox, the editor of Nature, also\njudged the big bang cosmogony as \"philosophically unacceptable,\" claiming that\n\"creationists ... have ample justification in the doctrine of the Big Bang,\"\nbecause it is vitiated by \"the philosophical difficulty that an important issue, that\nof the ultimate origin of our world, cannot be discussed.\" </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEMS</h3>\n\n<p>In this discussion we will focus on the general philosophical issues surrounding the\nvarious points of opposition between biblical and scientific cosmologies. The major issues\ncan be summarized as follows: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x95; design versus chance </p>\n\n<p>&#x95; externally imposed order versus autonomously self-ordering</p>\n\n<p>&#x95; temporal versus eternal </p>\n\n<p>&#x95; creation versus formation</p>\n\n<p>&#x95; \"something more\" versus \"nothing but\" {fallacies of\nreductive materialism and presuppositionalism)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These issues encompass the major philosophical influences on scientific interpretations\nof cosmological data leading to views in conflict with Christian views. Although\nhistorical interpretations of biblical cosmology have not been immune from philosophical\npresuppositions this problem is not addressed here. Our ultimate concern in this paper is\nto critique how philosophical preferences have influenced the development and\ninterpretation of scientific cosmologies. Each of the above issues are discussed in detail\nin the following section. At this point we simply will summarize the primary points of\nopposition that have arisen between the scientific and biblical cosmologies. The\ndistinctions between the scientific and biblical cosmologies given in the following table\nform the foundational beliefs in naturalism that are the source of conflict with biblical\nsupernaturalism. </p>\n\n\n\n<table width=\"100%\" cellspacing=\"4\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th width=\"33%\"><b>Aspects of </b><p>The Universe</p></th>\n    <th width=\"33%\">Scientific Cosmology</th>\n    <th width=\"33%\">Biblical Cosmology</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"33%\">Existence</td>\n    <td width=\"33%\">Necessary</td>\n    <td width=\"33%\">Contingent</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"33%\">Form and structure</td>\n    <td width=\"33%\">Chance or possibly the Anthropic Principle</td>\n    <td width=\"33%\">Design</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"33%\">Reality</td>\n    <td width=\"33%\">Nature is all there is.

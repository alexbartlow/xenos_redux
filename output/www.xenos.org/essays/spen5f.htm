These were the main applications that Spener drew from his fusion of\nmysticism and biblically oriented Lutheranism. However, it would be naive to think that\nthese same premises would not also, in time, lead to a more \"spiritual\" or\nsubjective understanding of the church. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Brown points out that from the earliest time, the terms \"pietistic\" and\n\"individualistic\" have been used synonymously in theological parlance.167\nLikewise, the mystic is alone with his God when most of the deep things happen. The\nmystical gospel calls for individual growth or attainment, and does not excuse the\nindividual for carnality, even if he/she does go to church. Mystical theology tends to ask\nnot \"How is your community doing?\" but \"How is your personal walk with God\ndoing?\" This is why Alfred Hegler is plausible when he argued that \"the basic\nsource for . . .the `radical reform movements,' the `radical tributaries,' or the `left\nwing' of the Reformation was medieval mysticism.\"168 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Heyd observes, </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>True, individual judgment had always been a constituent element of the Protestant\n  tradition, but it is often forgotten that in the period of the Reformation and of\n  Protestant Orthodoxy, the role ascribed to the individual was counterbalanced by the\n  central position of the Church and public authorities in determining issues of doctrine\n  and discipline. 169 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>This individualistic outlook would have been given added impulse by Spener's\ninsistence that the individual study his Bible, and develop ministry.170 Once again,\nhistory teaches that the individual with the Bible in his hand is a force for spiritual\nrevolution. It is not without cause that the established church has sometimes tended to\navoid too many laymen with too many Bibles--such individuals might reach new conclusions:\nperhaps heretical conclusions, perhaps critiques of the existing church. Stoeffler feels\nthat the biblicism of the Pietists, which was not a factor in mystical theology, accounts\nfor the change in view regarding roles in the church. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>It was this implicit, somewhat naive, trust in the Word, rather than in man's\nwords about the Word, which is also responsible for the fact that Pietists really trusted\nthe religious opinions of theologically untrained laymen. The theory was, of course, that\nthe Spirit of God is able to commend the truth of the Bible to men's minds and hearts\nwithout the tortured interpretations of the professionals. Hence, to the consternation of\nthe representatives of orthodoxy and ecclesiastical institutionalism, laymen were\npermitted to testify, to exhort, and even to preach. The doctrine of the priesthood of all\nbelievers was thus rescued once again from being a mere dogma and set free to exert its\ninfluence in the Church. 171 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>As some Pietists went into separatism, Spener tried to stem the tide that he had\nunleashed, with limited success. Brown explains; </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>[Spener] attempted to persuade all to return to the church. This was the purpose\n  of his tract, The Use and the Misuse of the Laments Over Corrupted Christendom, which\n  appeared in 1684 and was reprinted in 1687 and 1696. In this tract Spener stated that even\n  though the church was corrupt, it was the true church from which no one should turn away..\n  . . </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>He repeatedly deplored separation, \"claiming that it acted like a medicine\n  which was more dangerous than the disease it was supposed to cure.. . . </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>Nevertheless, the extreme expression of self-assertion against external church\n  authority which more and more emancipated itself from the restraints of tradition was the\n  work of later Pietism.172 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>Spener's and Francke's individualism also tended to move them toward more\ndemocratic control in the churches. Brown says, </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>Spener and Francke were consistently Lutheran; nevertheless, they and their\n  followers often stretched Luther's definitions in their appeal for a more democratic\n  church polity and in the mystical tendencies inherent in the style of the conventicles. .\n  . </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>Spener was criticized for the egalitarianism of his pastoral service and his small\n  group meetings, in which servants were allowed to sit and the same tables as their\n  masters.173 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>Naturally, the view of the individual before his God tended to render class and\necclesiastic distinctions meaningless.174 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Another ecclesiological by-product of the fusion of Reformation and Mystical\ntheology was the alteration of Lutheran sacramentalism. The platonism of the medieval\nmystics sometimes led to an anti-sacramental attitude. An example this can be seen in the\nTheologia Deutsch, which, after quoting Tauler as declaring, \"There be some men at\nthe present time who take leave of imagery [sacraments] too soon. . .\" goes on to\nargue that only, </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>. . .as a man has thus broken loose from and overleaped all temporal things and\n  creatures he may afterward come to perfection in a life of contemplation. For he who will\n  have the one must let the other go. There is no other way.175 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>The argument here is not that one should avoid leaving sacraments behind, but\nrather that this should not be attempted by the immature. Likewise, Arndt did not usually\nspeak of baptismal regeneration, as did his orthodox contemporaries. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>He thus linked himself definitely with many of the later Lutheran Pietists to whom\nthe Lutheran doctrine of baptismal regeneration as popularly held was always an occasion\nof regret or at least of embarrassment. . .[although] Arndt held the historic Lutheran\nview of baptism. In point of fact, however, he said little about it and put the emphasis\non conversion, oneness with Christ, and a holy life.\" 176 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>It is not surprising then that Spener's and Francke's critics, </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>. . .accused them of adopting a mystical and spiritualistic interpretation of the\n  sacraments. Spener, as customary, desired to walk the middle ground: \"as in all\n  things, two extremes are possible, it is a deviation to place your trust outwardly in the\n  mere custom of the sacrament and be concerned little with the inward. But it is also a\n  deviation when one chooses to despise and set aside the outward because of the\n  inward.\"177 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>The tension between adult conversion and infant baptism became acute for Spener\nand Francke. This should be especially clear when one realizes that they did not accept\nthe doctrine of unconditional election.178 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Likewise, Spener's stress on the possibility of losing the new birth following\nbaptism and on the new obedience which baptism requires significantly altered traditional\nbaptism. </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>The Pietists' need for subjective appropriation made it possible for some of the\n  followers of Spener and Francke to minimize infant baptism in favor of the later\n  conversion experience and to circumvent the objective efficacy of the sacrament. Francke\n  and Spener, however, attempted to avoid this tendency.179 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>The churchly pietists were careful to not openly question the orthodox\ninterpretation of the sacraments. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>However, Brown credits Spener with a major role in undermining the Beischtuhl\n(confessional) permanently in Lutheranism. This in spite of the fact that Francke himself\nconfessed to a neighboring minister four times each year before partaking of the Lord's\nsupper. </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>The Beischtuhl . . .figured prominently in Pietist controversies. Although it was\n  practically considered a sacrament by many of the orthodox, Spener and Francke felt freer\n  to attack it than the two traditional Protestant sacraments. . . .its is very likely that\n  Pietism, with its critical stance and opposition to compulsion, abetted the demise of the\n  confessional.180 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>As we shall see, many of the later radical Pietists openly rejected or deprecated\nsacraments.</big></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><big>The Churchly Pietistic Movement</big></h3>\n\n<h5><big>Pietistic Conventicles</big></h5>\n\n<p><big>Spener held the first of his private meetings in his own home in Frankfurt am Main\nin 1670. With the popularity of the Pia Desideria, there were soon conventicles meeting\nall over Europe. Tappert affirms that, </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Spener himself soon ascribed more and more importance to the collegia pietatis,\nwhich were given only passing attention in his Pia Desideria. If the church was to be\nrenewed, he felt, a beginning would have to be made with the remnant of true Christians in\nevery congregation.181 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>The responses to the advent of the collegia pietatis were two-fold--bitter attacks\nfrom the church,182 and terrific excitement from lay people. Two questions that must be\nanswered are, \"Why did such an enthusiastic reception greet the collegia?\" and,\n\"Why were they opposed so bitterly by the church?\" </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Regarding the first question, before a proper understanding of pietism can be\ngained, one must realize that there was a vigorous ferment of pietistic, spiritualistic\nand mystical strains already present in Europe at this time, independent of Spener's\nmovement. This can be seen, for instance, when one considers how many tens of thousands of\nAnabaptists were killed from the time of the Reformation until the time of Spener.183 For\nAnabaptism to have still been a vital force in Europe despite this many casualties gives\nan idea of the profound thirst for religious authenticity and freedom that must have given\nrise to such endurance. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Many authors have insisted that the Thirty Years War, with its hundreds of\nthousands of deaths on all sides, had rendered institutional religion disgusting in the\nview of much of the public. Then there were the many thousands of cells or nuclei of\nvarious other groups who took a more inner view of Christianity.184 This spiritualistic\nunderground was the well-spring that was uncapped by Spener. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>When the Pia Desideria, with its concise and persuasive arrangement, not to\nmention its friendly and benign tone, was published by one with the prestige of the\nscholarly Spener, thousands rallied to it as a standard. It is very unlikely that all of\nthese were persuaded for the first time by the book. They were probably already inclined\nto a more personal form of religious expression.185 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Speaking of such an underground that had been a part of the European scene for\nseveral hundred years, Peters shows that the themes had always been the same; </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>In particular terms, the Reformists attacked the immorality of the clergy, the\n  hierarchy, and the authority of the church; usually they also attacked the sacraments as\n  unnecessary to salvation and as supposing the necessity of a mediating clergy between a\n  man and his God.186 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>Regarding the second question, the attacks by the existing clergy were severe.\n\"The charge of the theological faculty of the University of Wittemberg that pietists\nwere guilty of at least 284 heresies suggests something of its bitterness. . .Spener was\ncalled a Quaker, a Rosicrucian, a chiliast, and a fanatic.\"187 The main reason the\nchurch attacked the collegia so vigorously seems to have been worry about their ability to\ncontrol the situation. Brown observes, </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Engendering the most criticism and accusations of subjectivism were the small\ngroup meetings known variously as Collegia pietatis, conventicles, ecclesiolae, or\ncollegia philobiblica.188 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Very soon after the first one was started in Spener's home, it became the occasion\nfor separatist activity.189 As mentioned earlier, Spener tried to tie the meetings to the\nchurch by forbidding the Lord's Supper in the private gatherings. In spite of this and\nother safeguards, however, the conventicles continued to foster movements toward\nseparation. Deeter comments, </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>The major problem of the colleges of piety was that they stimulated certain\n  participants to a radical Christianity which could not be generally spread throughout the\n  larger body of the Church. Then after repeated frustrations at the slowness of many fellow\n  church goers to accept more radical Christian living, the unsatisfied converts often\n  became separatistic. . . Moreover, they were often openly antagonistic to the compromisers\n  within the larger Church who saw something of their vision but refused to break with its\n  `half-way Christianity.'\"190 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h5><big>Francke </big></h5>\n\n<p><big>August Hermann Francke was born in 1663, and studied theology at Liepzig. He\nstarted home Bible studies while there called collegium philobiblicum. Yet he suffered\nfrom doubt regarding inspiration of Scripture and even the existence of God. He was\ninfluenced by followers of Spener while in Liepzig.191 Then in 1687 he experienced a\ndecisive conversion which left him sure of his relationship with Christ.192 He visited\nSpener for several months afterward and returned to operate his home studies in the\nPietistic fashion. An investigation, initiated by a suspicious clergyman, led to the\nsuppression of the home studies.193 After being ousted from a pastorate in Erfurt because\nof Pietistic activities, Spener was able to get him a professorship of Greek and oriental\nlanguages at the newly-founded university at Halle, along with a pastorate in a local\nchurch.194 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Francke was different than Spener. He was much more decisive and active. He shared\nin common with Spener however, a practical bent, and the desire to avoid open separation\nfrom the Lutheran church.195 Francke exerted great influence at Halle, eventually\nunleashing a new phase in the history of Pietism. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Under the influence of Francke, Pietistic spirituality was increasingly\ninterpreted in an outward, in addition to an inward way. This had the effect of providing\nan outlet for Pietistic zeal other than perfectionism, and may have had more impact on the\ncourse of church history than any other part of the Pietistic movement. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>He founded numerous social relief institutions a Halle, including a school for\npoor children, a very large orphanage, an institute for training of teachers, and later a\npublishing house, medical clinic, and others businesses where the indigent could work and\npay their way. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>In addition, Francke had a \"lifelong concern for evangelism and\nmissions.\"196 He eventually turned Halle into a training center for missionaries who\nwent all over the world. This was important because neither the Lutheran nor the Reformed\nchurches had the slightest interest in missions at that time. Glover explains, </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>The roots of modern missions reach back to the Reformation . . .Yet, as already\n  remarked, the Reform leaders, and the Reformation church as a whole, were for at least a\n  full century almost completely devoid of missionary spirit or effort. . .As Dr. George\n  Smith expresses it, the seeds of controversy sown by Lutheran orthodoxy began to bear a\n  harvest which would have been fatal to the spirituality of the Church but for the Pietist\n  Movement, which by example and preaching gradually aroused the Church to a deeper\n  spiritual life and, as a natural consequence, to renewed missionary zeal and action.197 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>Francke was not the first to see the evangelistic implications of the Pietistic\nmessage. Spener had stated in the Spiritual Priesthood, </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>Is there anything else that we should offer to God? </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>Yes; namely the doctrine of the gospel and thereby our fellow man who by it is\n  converted and sanctified (Malachi 1:11; Rom. 15:16; Is. 60:7; Phil. 2:17,18. . .). 198 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>However, this was problematic when the entire society was already considered\nChristian. The only groups who were considered \"unsaved\" were the Jews and the\nRoman Catholics. These were the groups that Spener had suggested should be won.199 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>By moving in the direction of foreign missions, Francke was the first to put\neffective action to the concept of outreach as a fruit of spiritual growth. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>A careful study of the biography of Francke is outside the scope of this paper,\nbut the main points along with source material can be read in Pietists: Selected Writings,\nPeter C. Erb Ed. </big></p>\n\n<h5><big>Zinzindorf</big></h5>\n\n<p><big>Zinzindorf was Francke's student at Halle, and Spener's godson. He underwent an\nawakening while studying, and proceeded to organize a group of refugees from Moravia into\ncollegia pietatis within the Lutheran church. Later, they formed the basis of the\nre-vitalized Moravian Brethren church.200 This group exerted global influence, and are\nperhaps the main river flowing out of the churchly Pietistic movement. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Properly speaking, William Carey should not be called the father of the modern\nmissionary movement. Sixty years before Carey went out, and 150 years before Hudson Taylor\nwent out, the Moravian Brethren began sending out their first missionaries. Their first\noutreach was to St. Thomas Island in the West Indies in 1732.201 They reached out to\ntwelve more areas of the world within the next twenty years, and eventually sent out 2,158\nmissionaries within the next 150 years! The well known English social reformer, William\nWilberforce wrote of the Moravians, \"They are a body who have perhaps excelled all\nmankind in solid and unequivocal proofs of the love of Christ and ardent, active zeal in\nHis service.\"202 </big></p>\n\n<h5><big>Wesley</big></h5>\n\n<p><big>Most reading evangelical Christians are aware that Wesley was impressed by the\nMoravian Brethren missionaries he met while he was still an unconverted priest on his way\nto Georgia. Later, Wesley attended a Moravian meeting at Aldersgate St. where, while\nhearing Luther's introduction to Romans, he had an experience in which he said \"I\nfelt my heart strangely warmed. . ..\" </big></p>\n\n<p><big>However, many do not realize that within two weeks of this experience, Wesley\ndecided to go to Germany and spend time studying under the Pietists at Halle. He recounts\nthe reasons for the decision, </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>\"I hoped that conversing with those holy men who were themselves living\n  witnesses of the full power of faith, and yet able to bear with those that are weak, would\n  be a means, under God, of so establishing my soul, that I might go on from faith to faith.\n  . .\" 203 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>Wesley then spent the next four months with the Pietists at Halle. Subsequently,\nwe find many elements of the Pietistic agenda present in Wesley's ministry. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>He began to include a distinct call for conversion in his sermons. He organized\nconventicles, which were called \"classes,\" \"societies,\" or\n\"bands,\" depending on their size makeup, and purpose. Attendance at a band\nrequired that the member bring his or her penny for the poor (recalling the practical\nrelief concerns of the Halle group). His theological outlook reflects that of Francke and\nSpener very much. Finally, he sought to do all of this within the bounds of his own\nconfession (Anglican). </big></p>\n\n<p><big>For these reasons, the Methodist movement is considered by historians and\ntheologians to be in the mainstream of the churchly Pietistic movement. </big></p>\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Philip Jacob Spener's Contribution to the Protestant Doctrine of the Church V","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/spen5f.htm"}

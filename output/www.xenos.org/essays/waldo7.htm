Huss was a scholar lecturing at the University of Prague. He taught that the\nBible was the sole authority for faith and practice, and salvation by faith. He was\npromised safe conduct to the Council of Constance to answer for his views, but was seized\nand burned at the stake anyway. At this point the population of sections of modern Austria\nand Czechoslovakia rose in open revolt. </p>\n\n<p>One new twist in this revolt was that some fought when attacked by the inevitable papal\narmy. In the same way that the Paulicians had earlier, they actually fought the Roman\nCatholic Church to a standstill in the 1400's. The fortress that they later formed at\nTabor gave one group of them the name Taborites. </p>\n\n<p>When word of this revolution reached the Waldensians, they reacted with excitement.\nThey promptly dispatched several \"barbas\" (\"uncles\", the term used by\nWaldensians for their teachers)70 to go to Bohemia and learn what was happening. There\nfollowed a series of meetings between leaders of the two groups which led to great benefit\nfor the Waldensians. They received from the Hussite movement training in theology which\nwas to prove very helpful to future generations. </p>\n\n<p>As a result, the barbas during this period were capable of reading theological works in\nLatin, of studying mathematics, and knowing enough botany and rudimentary medicine to\npermit them to deal with simple diseases. Their activity in ministerial tasks likewise\nbecame more organized, rigorous and systematic than before. A young Waldensian whose gifts\nand resolve marked him for service in the community would be apprenticed to an experienced\nbarba for a period of several years. After becoming familiar with the various places to\nvisit, learning languages and studying the Bible more deeply, the young barba would then\nvisit the different clandestine scholae or underground schools.71 </p>\n\n<p>It is also interesting to note that although the Waldensians had almost always been\npacifist, on one occasion they raised money for the Bohemian war chest. On another\noccasion, at Prali, a pitched battle between the local populace and the crusaders ended by\nCount Hugo pulling back his troops.72 </p>\n\n<p>The Reformation </p>\n\n<p>Tourn states that, </p>\n\n<p>Relentless inquisition, crusade and pillage had done their efficient work, so that by\nthe end of the 15th century a veil of silence hung over much of the Waldensian world.73 </p>\n\n<p>Yet the Waldensians still existed. By now, they were almost exclusively concentrated in\nthe Alpine valleys that had served as their main stronghold all along. </p>\n\n<p>When the reformation erupted in 1517, the Waldensians were eager to join forces with\nthe new fellow-revolutionists. We know that as early as the year 1526, a general assembly\nof Waldensians held at Laus, in the Chisone valley, was so eager to make personal contact\nwith the new movement that it made the decision to send a deputation across the Alps.74 </p>\n\n<p>Luther, who so strongly denounced the Hussites at first, discovered during the Liepzig\nDisputation that he agreed with Huss. Later he said \"We were all Hussites without\nknowing it!\"75 Eventually, he wrote a preface to the Taborite Confession of Faith, in\nwhich he referred to the Hussites as \"Waldensians\". </p>\n\n<p>No official ties were forged between the Waldensians and the other Protestant Churches\nuntil 1532. In that year, the Synod of Chanforan was held, in which the Waldensians became\na part of the reformed Church based in Geneva. For the Reformed, Farel led the\nnegotiations, which were troubled, because of the Waldensian insistence on the separation\nof church and state, as well as other doctrinal differences.76 The Swiss reformers also\ncalled on the Waldensians to put an end to confessions, fasts and \"meritorious\nSundays,\" and to introduce an emphasis on the doctrine of predestination.77 </p>\n\n<p>In the same year, the Geneva Reformers helped the Waldensians do a new translation of\nthe Bible. The task was entrusted to Olivetan, a relative of Calvin's, who retired\nsecretly to a village in the Alps to do his work. </p>\n\n<p>The remarkable translation he produced (for which Calvin himself wrote the Preface) has\ncome to be known as the \"Olivetan Bible,\" the first of the French Reformation.\nPrinted in Neuchatel, it was delivered to the Waldensians in 1535.78 </p>\n\n<p>Many of their worst trials, including massacres, were still ahead of them in 1532, but\nthey were now a part of an international movement. Because they were no longer alone as an\nisolated sect, and because their doctrine was essentially reformed, they pass beyond the\nscope of this study.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n\n<p>It is questionable whether the Waldensians ever exceeded 100,000 functional members at\nany one time before the Reformation. Yet when one considers that they existed in some\nforce for almost 350 years before the reformation began, it is evident that many\ngenerations, and therefore many times their total were affected. </p>\n\n<p>No one knows, even roughly, the total number killed in the persecutions the Waldensians\nendured, but the lowest estimates must run into the several tens of thousands. It is\nunlikely that any group other than the Anabaptists and Jews can point to a comparable\nhistory of prolonged universal persecution. Their amazing survival makes them different,\nthan the other schismatic groups that began at the same time. The crime which precipitated\nsuch suffering was their desire to exercise their birthright in the Body of Christ\naccording to the New Testament--the practice of their own gifts and ministries </p>\n\n<p>The Waldensian Church still exists today in several locations.79 Unfortunately, the\nfusion with the Reformed Church has not resulted in the rapid ferment of outreach that\nonce characterized the movement. Nevertheless, the fact that they remain in existence at\nall is a strong testimony, and perhaps a galling reminder to some, that the effort to\ndisenfranchise the laity from their right to minister will be frustrated by the power of\nthe Holy Spirit Himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/waldo1.htm\">Go back to the Waldensian table of contents</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/chhist.htm\">Go back to the Church History page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/waldo8.htm\">Browse the Endnotes and Bibliography</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Go back to the Xenos home page</a> \n\n</p><dl>\n  <dt><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=waldensian\">Ask\n    Dennis a question or share a comment.</a> </dt>\n</dl>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Waldensian Movement From Waldo to the Reformation VI","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/waldo7.htm"}

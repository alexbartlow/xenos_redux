He may have been the author of\nthe famous devotional book, The Imitation of Christ.112 He was an Augustinian monk who was\ninvolved in developing what historians refer to as the `New Devotion' in Germany during\nthe fourteenth century. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Although he wrote on many subjects, all of his writings were \"pervaded by the\ndevotional spirit.\"113 Spener does not cite Kempis in the works in translation, but\nhe does refer favorably to several times, as seen. Tauler, Theologia Deutsch, and Arndt\ndefinitely depend on the Imitation to varying extents. </big></p>\n\n<h5><big>Meister Eckhard-- </big></h5>\n\n<p><big>He was a benedictine teacher who eventually went to pantheistic extremes in his\nspeculations. Eckhard was born around 1260, and was friar preacher in Strassbourg from\n1314 to 1320. It is clear that Tauler (see below) must have been influenced directly and\nindirectly by him. Eckhard was condemned after his death in 1329 by Pope John XXII in the\nBull In Agro Dominico.114 There is little evidence that Spener or Arndt depend directly on\nhim to any great degree. However, they drew heavily on Tauler. In Eckhard's writings one\ncan find both the admirable and the bizarre. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>For instance, his answer to the question of whether one who prefers living in\nisolation would not be better off in the church was, </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>No.. . .Those who do well, do well wherever they are, and in whatever company, and\n  those who do badly do badly wherever they are, and in whatever company. But if a man does\n  well, God is really in him, and with him everywhere, on the streets and among people just\n  as much as in church, or a desert place or a cell. . . </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>but, he adds, </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>The more he regards everything as divine--more divine than it is of itself--the\n  more God will be pleased with him. . .115 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h5><big>Johannus Tauler-- </big></h5>\n\n<p><big>Tauler seems at times to be second only to Luther in the thinking of both Arndt\nand Spener. He stands squarely in the center of the late medieval German mystical\ntradition. Tauler was a native of Strassbourg, born about 1300. He became a Dominican\nfriar, and would have heard Eckhard lecture during his student days. He was a strong\npreacher who was usually in distress over the moral life of the people, including the\nclergy. He became so disillusioned by the 1350's that he said \"If I had known what I\nnow know I should have lived on my inheritance and not on alms.\"116 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Erb points out that, \"Long before scholars decreed the mutual exclusion\nbetween \"Reformation\" and \"mysticism\", Luther himself had ingested and\nincorporated into his own thinking the sermons of Bernard of Clairvaux, the biblical piety\nof his spiritual director Johannes Staupitz, and the meditations of Johannes Tauler. .\n.\" _ </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Some examples of typical sentiments expressed by Tauler in his sermons are: </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>Man must do his part and rise from every thing that is not God, away from himself\n  and all created things. And as he rises, the depth of his soul is seized by a powerful\n  longing to be denuded and freed from everything that separates it from God. . .They have\n  to abandon their presumptions and arrogant ways and begin the strenuous work of\n  self-denial. . . 117 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>They [The truly spiritual] are raised to a supernatural, a divine level, and none\n  of their work is ever done without God. And if one may dare to utter it, they themselves\n  no longer work, but God works in them. How blessed they are! They are the lofty pillars of\n  the universe, on whom rests the weight of the whole world. To find oneself in such a state\n  - what a glorious and joyful thing that would be. </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>External works are of no avail to them, of none whatsoever, Does not the word\n  \"surge\" mean arise? That indeed is a work. It is the one work necessary, and\n  they should perform it without ceasing as long as they live. A man can never reach\n  perfection unless he wishes to arise, lift up his spirit to God, and free his innermost\n  ground. 118 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>But what it is that He does in those depths of the soul which have been touched by\n  Him directly, no one can say. Nor can any man tell another, and even he who has\n  experienced it must remain silent. For where God truly takes possession of the soul, all\n  external activity ceases, but the interior perception of God mightily increases. 119 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>The <i>imatatio Christi </i>motif are evident, \"And furthermore, since God,\nOur Sovereign Lord and Father, suffered such great indignities and so many torments, all\nthose who would like to be counted among His friends should be glad to suffer with Him. .\n.120 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>The theme of union, and the use of paradoxes are common, \"No one can\nunderstand these distinctions better than those who have gone beyond distinctions and have\nattained unity. This state is called and indeed is an unfathomable darkness, and yet it is\nthe essential light. It is and is said to be an incomprehensible and solitary wilderness,\nfor no one can find his way there, for it is above all ways, above all modes and\nmanners.\" 121 </big></p>\n\n<h5><big>Theologia Germanica (German Theology)</big></h5>\n\n<p><big>This anonymous work dates from the fourteenth century. The treatise quotes Tauler,\nalthough some continued to believe that Tauler was actually the author. Certainly, the\nthinking is similar. The themes of the work are the same as all late medieval mysticism,\n\"<i>Reinigung, Erleuchtung, Und Vereinigung</i>\" (purification, illumination,\nand union). It calls for the removal of Adam's \"<i>ich und sein mich und sein myr\n(sic) und sein mien</i>\" (Adam's \"I\" his \"myself\" his\n\"me\" and his \"mine.\"). </big></p>\n\n<p><big>The book was published with an introduction by none other than Martin Luther in\n1515 and again in 1518. It will be seen that two years before the 95 theses were posted,\nas well as after, Luther was deeply affected by this tractate.122 It was used and praised\nby Karlstadt, Hanz Denck, Sebastian Castillio, and Valentin Weigel, all important players\nin the sixteenth century. It was a basic and widely used document for Anabaptist theology\nand ethics.123 John Calvin condemned it as the poison of the Devil, and Pope Paul V placed\nit on the Index of Forbidden Books, where it remains today.124 Spener and Arndt both\nmention it often, as do Francke and later pietists. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Luther said in his 1515 edition of the German Theology that the work, \"does\nnot drift on the surface like foam on water but is issued forth from the depths of the\nJordan. . .\" He also speculates that the author could be none other than Tauler\nhimself. 125 Spener quotes Luther's comment that \". . .neither in Latin nor in German\nhave I found theology purer and more beneficial, which also agrees with the gospel.\"\n126 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>In a typical passage the author prays, \"that we may thus deny and renounce\nourselves, and forsake all things through God, and die to our own self-will, and live unto\nGod alone and to his Will. . .127 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>One can see some of the problems with this kind of work from the section on what\nthe ultimate goal for the believer is; </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>\"But what is that one thing? I answer: It is the Good--or that which has\n  become good--and yet neither this good nor that, which we can name, or know, or show; but\n  it is all good, and above all good. Moreover, it need not to enter the soul, for it is\n  there already, only it is unperceived. When we say we should come to it, we mean that we\n  should seek it, feel it, and taste it. And now since it is One, unity and singleness is\n  better than manifoldness. For blessedness lies not in much and manifoldness, but in One\n  and oneness. 128 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h5><big>Heinrich Suso--</big></h5>\n\n<p><big>Heinrich Suso illustrates some of the difficulties that a mystical outlook can\nlead to. He was born around 1300 and entered the Dominican monastery at the age of 13.\nDuring a ten year period of strict seclusion in the Dominican friary, Suso practiced\nsevere bodily discipline. \"He wore a hair shirt and an iron chain. His under-garment\nhad leather straps and iron nails with sharp points. He had a girdle round his neck to\nwhich his hands were fastened so that he could not scratch his sores at night. He put on\nleather gloves studded with spikes. He fixed a wooden cross to his back with iron nails in\nit. An old disused wooden door served as his bed and he had no bed-clothes except in\nwinter when he threw an old coat over himself. For a long time he ate only once a day; he\nabstained from wine and at times drank nothing all day, suffering tortures of hunger and\nthirst.\"129 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>His first work, The Book of Truth, was a defense of Eckhard's teachings, which he\nknew well. He was prior of the Dominicans in Constance for many years. At the age of 40,\nhe gave up asceticism for good, and entered the state of Gelassenheit (resignation).130\nSelections of his material can be read in translation in The Library of Christian\nClassics.131 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>The villain in the sixth chapter of his The Little Book of Truth, reminiscent of\nso much of Spener and Arndt's criticism, is the \"wildman\" who is \"skilled\nin words, but unpracticed in works, puffed up with pride and vanity.\"132 </big></p>\n\n<h3><big>Post Reformation Sources of Pietistic Ecclesiology</big></h3>\n\n<p><big>We are not as sure about the post reformation sources on the mystical side.\nLuther, through Dannhauer and Arndt have already been mentioned as influences for Spener.\nOn the mystical side, there are several others who may have contributed to Spener's\nthought. </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>Jacob Boehme-- </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>Boehme was an unlearned, but intelligent cobbler. In his youth he often fell into\ntrances, sometimes for days, in the manner strikingly similar to shamans in oral\nsocieties. Then as a young man, he had a decisive vision in which he was enlightened once\nand for all. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>During his enlightening vision His own personal spirit united, \"with the\ninnermost Birth in God and stood in the Light.\" He discovered that \"God goes\nclean another way to work\" than by the way of reasoning or of sense experience -\n\"instead of waiting for man to climb up to Him, He climbs up into man's soul.\"\n133 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Jones says of Boehme, \"His Way of Salvation [focused] . . .upon the native\ndivine possibilities of the soul, . . .and upon the necessity of personal and inward\nexperience as the key to every gate of life. . .Christianity, [is]. . . not\n\"history\" . . .it is an experience in which the soul finds itself \"at the\ntop of Jacob's ladder,\" and feels its life in God and God's Life in it in an\nineffable Love-union. . ..134 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>According to Ensign, Boehme conceives God, in Himself, as being the Ungrund\n(non-reason). Faith is not a mere assent to certain \"opinions\" (Meinungen) much\nless accepting an \"imputed\" righteousness, while remaining a \"brute.\"\nBoehme \"never tires of insisting that the restoration can come only by a process of\nLife, not by a `scheme' of theology. . .Heaven and hell are present everywhere.\" 135\nA man, he says, must die wholly to self-hood, forsake it and enter again into the original\nNothing, - the eternal Unity in which nothing is willed in particular,- before God can\nhave His way with him; only then, \"Christ is born and lives in our Nothingness.\"\n136 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Regarding ecclesiology, Stoffer explains that, \"Boehme was dissatisfied with\nLutheran Orthodoxy and its bias toward ex opere operato interpretations of the efficacy of\nthe Word and Sacraments. He felt that such traditional theological formulations were\nactually obscuring the Christian message. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Jones says, \"He dislikes, as much as did the English Quaker, George Fox, the\ncustom of Calling \"stone houses\" churches. . .His attitude toward outward\nsacraments consistently fits in with all his central teachings. The outward, for Boehme, .\n. .can always be used as a parable or symbol of something inner and eternal. But the\noutward is at best only temporal, only symbolic, and it becomes a hindrance if it is taken\nfor the real substance of which it is only the outward `signature'\" 137 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Stoffer adds that \"It was this critical attitude toward the external church\nthat supplied Boehme and those influenced by him with the motivation for ecclesiastical\nseparatism.\"138 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Interestingly, Jones points out that Boehme wrote some portions using automatic\nhandwriting. \". . .the portions of his voluminous writings which bear the mark of\nhaving been written as automatic script - by \"this hand,\" as he often says - are\nthe chaotic and confused portions, full of monotonous repetitions, of undigested and\nindigestible phrases and the dreary re-shufflings of sub-conscious wreckage.\"139 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Most scholars feel that the Pietistic movement was influenced by Boehme\n(1575-1624), especially the later radical pietists. This is surprising, because Boehme\nwent beyond mysticism to theosophy.140 We do know that Spener vigorously defended the\nright of some pietist preachers not to sign a denunciation against \"False\nphilosophers anti-scripturals, lax-theologians and other fanatics, namely Jacob Boehme. .\n. etc.\" that was issued by Mayer, an anti-pietistic theologian. 141 He also refused\nto condemn Boehme's material with the excuse that he had neither read him enough nor\nunderstood him sufficiently to give an opinion.142 This excuse seems implausible for one\nwho took as much interest as Spener in what was happening in Christianity.143 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Some scholars argue that the radical pietists had Boehme as their primary\ninfluence, and even even some of the churchly pietists were heavily influenced by Boehme.\nAlthough no scholars surveyed seriously resist this thesis, the actual evidence for the\nbelief was not presented in translation, other than coincidental views on the church, and\ncertain other mystical-spiritualistic themes. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Indeed, there seems to be a likely connection between Boehme's critique of the\nestablished church and the views of the radical pietists. But even here, unless a direct\nliterary dependence is demonstrated, it seems possible that they may have arrived at the\nsame position without much help from Boehme. There were certainly many others holding\nsimilar views to Boehme who did not depend on him at all.144 This goes as well for the\nmystical elements in Boehme's soteriology. In the first place, few of the distinctively\nBoehmist elements were demonstrated by Ensign in the writings of the radical pietists. The\nelements mentioned are also held in common with other sources. In fact, nature mysticism\nwas a major undercurrent in Europe, in which Boehm stood just like the others.145 Some of\nhis speculations seem even further from that of most of the radical pietists. </big></p>\n\n<h5><big>Denck, Schwenckfeld, Franck and Weigel</big></h5>\n\n<p><big>Stoeffler refers to these radical mystics of the sixteenth and seventeenth century\nas \"proponents of the inner life.\" They are sometimes referred to as\nanabaptists, but this is incorrect according to both Stoeffler and Ozment. They all drew\npart of their inspiration from the same sources as Arndt--late medieval mysticism. 146 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>However, they all have in common the nature mysticism of their more influential\ncolleague Boehme. Jones states that the sources for the nature mysticism of Weigel and\nBoehme are; </big>\n\n</p><ol>\n  <li><big>The newly available translations of Plato and the neo-platonic philosophers brought\n    to the fifteenth century first by Marsilio Ficino (1433-1499), and to Germany by Johann\n    Reuchlin (1455-1522). </big></li>\n  <li><big>The Cabala, a Jewish collection of mystical speculations which became popular in\n    the thirteenth century, although its followers claim it is much older. It contains notions\n    of a transcendent God who is not imminent, and has no contact with matter, but issues\n    emanations from himself to those who do have such contact. It took much interest in magic\n    and the occult as well. </big></li>\n  <li><big>The renewed interest in nature and man that was the product of renaissance\n    humanism. </big></li>\n  <li><big>The powerful message of the German mystics.147 </big></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><big>Weigel was a particularly interesting case. He lived as an apparently orthodox\nLutheran pastor for his entire career, dishonestly signing the confessions of the church,\nalthough he did not believe them. Only after his death were his works published revealing\nthat he was a theosophist! </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Denck, Schwenckfeld, Franck and Weigel are important because Arndt and Spener were\nregularly accused of being disciples of these men. Indeed, Arndt included some of Weigel's\nmaterial in his True Christianity. Orthodox pastors must have wondered whether Spener\nwould also reveal his theosophical views after his death.148 </big></p>\n\n<h5><big>Jean de Labadie--</big></h5>\n\n<p><big>Another controversial figure who may have influenced Spener is Jean de Labadie.\nLabadie was a French Jesuit trained scholar who defected to the Reformed church after\nstudying the Institutes of Calvin. He was accepted into the reformed pastorate in 1650,\nand after two problematic appointments, eventually settled down in Geneva. There his fiery\npreaching, and his zealous call for reform in religion and morals resulted in substantial\nfame and notoriety. 149 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Later, he moved to a reformed pastorate in Holland, first at Orange, and later at\nMiddleberg. His reputation and his writings on asceticism, meditation, and contemplation\nwere spread throughout Holland during this period. While pastor at Middleberg he published\nhis Ecrit sur la prophetie (Amsterdam, 1668) [Concerning the Practice of Free Prophecy].\nThis was a book on the priesthood of all believers, and on the \"spiritual\"\nprinciple of interpretation of the Scriptures. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>However, more problems arose as Labadie grew increasingly radical. He refused to\nfollow the reformed liturgy, preferring extemporaneous prayers. His ardent circle of\nfollowers eventually became a separatistic sect. He was described as capricious and\nself-willed. Theologians in Utrect called him \"an irresponsible visionary\"150 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>He set about planting underground conventicles or communes devoted to pure worship\nof God. \"Thus,\" says Stoeffler, \"he became the father of separatistic\nPietism on the Continent.\" 151 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>These groups became known as Labadists. We can place Labadists in many of the\ncities where later radical pietist movements sprang up. 152 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>It is also interesting to note that beginning in 1659 Spener spent 2 years\ntraveling in Basil, Bern Lausanne, Geneva, Freiburg, and Tubingen. While at Geneva, he sat\nunder Labadie. He \"often went to hear him,\" met him personally, and later had\none of his French tracts published in German. 153 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Scholars debate how much influence Labadie had on Spener. Even during Spener's\nlife his critics charged that the idea of house meetings had come from Labadie. This was\nan embarrassment by that time, because Labadie was already teaching radical separatism.\nSpener denied that Labadie had had much influence, and Kurt Aland has argued effectively\nthat the extent of influence wielded by Labadie has been exaggerated.154 This is certainly\nthe case when those like Schmidt, who believed that Spener \"had [his book] at hand as\nhe wrote Pia Desideria.\" Spener admitted that he talked to Labadie a number of times\nand that he, \"found much that was good and edifying\" in Labadie's early works.\nEven Deeter reluctantly admits that \"it is certainly possible that Spener had imbibed\nsome of his ideas from Labadie.\"155 He points out that Spener had not read any of the\nlater separatistic Labadist literature (dating later than the time Labadie left France)\nbut this is somewhat beside the point. More importantly, Spener stated that Labadie was\nnot holding any home meetings during the time he knew him in Geneva.156 </big></p>\n\n<h5><big>The Quakers</big></h5>\n\n<p><big>The quietistic groups current in Europe and England bore a remarkable similarity\nto Pietism in most areas, except for their anti-sacramentalism. Spener knew about the\nQuakers and George Fox, although he was apparently not influenced by them at all.157 Later\nin his life, he adopted a more favorable view toward the Quakers because of their\nquietistic attitude and good works. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>On the other hand, critics of Spener's own time, such as pastor Roth of Liepzig\nwrote that the Pietists, \". . .opposed the authority of the church and that their\nzealous conventicles turned people away from the public worship of the church so that they\neven despised the preachers. This amounted to descending to the level of Quaker\nsectarianism.\" 158 Spener seemed to resent these accusations of Quakerism more than\nmost accusations. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>It seems clear that Spener did not understand Quakerism in his early days, because\nhe thought they believed that one should follow every impulse, even if it led to sin. He\nalso thought they had no use for the Scriptures. 159 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Later, he came to have a more or less favorable view of the Quakers, but this was\nwell after his own views were fully developed and published. Nevertheless, both his\ncritics, and the Quakers gleefully claimed that he was one of theirs. 160 </big></p>\n\n<h5><big>Other Arndtians</big></h5>\n\n<p><big>Stoeffler comments that the writings of successors to Arndt such as Stegmann and\nLassenius \"exhibit an excessive sweetness, a religious eroticism which tends to\nnauseate the modern reader.\" These amorous motifs, he feels, go back to the worst\nelements of medieval mysticism, which drew its inspiration from an allegorical reading of\nSong of Solomon. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>He thus identifies the later followers of these thinkers as \"erotic\nPietism,\" which can be differentiated from normal Pietism because it, \"had as\nits major aim pleasant feeling states rather than a reformed life. . .\" 161 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>They issued in a whole tradition of eighteenth century erotic Pietists writing\ntreatises and hymns \"whose dominant theme was erotic love for Christ.\" 162 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>There is no evidence that Spener followed this strain exactly, although it would\nhave been hard for him not to have been influenced by it at all. Some of the radical\npietists may have been more influenced by this school of thought. </big></p>\n\n<h5><big>The Waldensians </big></h5>\n\n<p><big>While at Geneva, Spener befriended the Waldensian minister Antonius Legerus, who\npersuaded him to study Waldensian history and teaching. This may have added to the\ntoleration theme that Spener later evinced. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Leger's version of Waldensian history is inaccurate, claiming that they can be\ntraced back to the time of Pope Sylvester. 163 This may have confirmed Spener's view that\nvalue could be found in the period before Luther. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>By considering the available evidence--connections that Spener had while growing\nup, his own statements, and circumstantial evidence--we find that he was a moderate\nmystic-Lutheran theologian, more aware than most of other theological options then\ncurrent, with all that implies. The pietistic movement that grew up around him universally\nbears the marks of this origin, but interpreted it differently. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Arndt and Spener stood for the confluence of the two streams of reformation\ntheology and late-medieval mysticism. Their followers and spin-offs would tend to see\nthose streams weighted differently--sometimes with one in ascendancy, sometimes the other.\nHowever, in most cases, little new was added. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>While noting the similarities with the earlier medieval mysticism, it is essential\nto note the differences as well. Stoeffler notes correctly, </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>While in its experientialism and religious idealism it bore a certain affinity to\n  medieval mysticism it differed sharply from that movement in its Biblicism.164 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>And somewhat less accurately, </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>What early evangelical Pietism actually endeavored to do was to preserve the\n  experiential element in Protestantism which was so obvious in Luther as well as in Calvin.\n  Its theology was wholly centered in the written Word, that Word having to be inwardly\n  appropriated through the Spirit in the fellowship of the Church. Thus the tension between\n  the subjective and the objective was resolved very much as it was in the theology of the\n  reformers. 165 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>Actually, it is likely that the Pietists were substantially <i>more </i>subjective\nthan the reformers were. Although Luther may have started out in a highly subjective\ntradition, not unlike that of Spener, he tended to grow away from that background to a\ngreater extent than Spener. It is doubtful that Spener would have approved of Luther's\nlife-style. Luther was guilty of fun-loving ribaldry and sometimes ate and drank to excess\nin a way Spener would have found difficult to justify. In short, the difference was not\none of doctrine, but rather in the fact that Arndt, Spener, Francke and their followers\nwere more restrictive than Luther was.166 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>One thing Spener never had in common with Luther was the actual experience of a\nlife of ascetic self-discipline such as that lived by Suso. Luther had also indulged in\nconsiderable self flagellation and kindred disciplines. These probably would have enabled\nhim to develop a more thorough critique of those thought systems than Spener.</big></p>\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Philip Jacob Spener's Contribution to the Protestant Doctrine of the Church IV","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/spen4f.htm"}

Unfortunately,\n        his analysis of postmodern society reveals that he is substantially persuaded\n        by postmodern assumptions, to the extent that he undermines any basis\n        for objective truth, for apologetics, or for the perspicuity (&#x201C;understandableness&#x201D;)\n      of Scripture.</p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">Thus, Newbigin takes his\n        place among the burgeoning caste of postmodern sympathizers writing on\n        contemporary ministry (now increasingly known as the &#x201C;Emergent\n        Church Movement&#x201D; or &#x201C;postconservatives.&#x201D;)<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote1anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/newbigin-emergent.htm#sdendnote1sym\">1</a></sup> In\n        fact, this book is one of the handbooks read and quoted often by leaders\n      in the movement. </p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">Although Newbigin scores\n        effective hits on modernistic rationalism, his attack overruns the opponent\n        until he finds himself on ground alien to the biblical world view&#x2014;the\n        ground of postmodern perspectivalism. Not only rationalism, but rationality\n        itself is jettisoned in favor of subjective mysticism and <i>a priori</i> blind\n      faith.</p>\n      <h2 class=\"western style1\">Apologetics &#x2013; a waste of time and a compromise\n      with modernism</h2>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">Newbigin begins by analyzing\n        the interaction of Christianity and Western culture since the middle\n        ages. He believes Christianity saw the rise of enlightenment rationalism\n        and <i>fell back</i>, or <i>retreated</i> to a position where Christianity\n        had to justify itself in rational terms. He never interacts with biblical\n        authors&#x2019; or Christ&#x2019;s own efforts to give rational evidence\n        for the gospel.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote2anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/newbigin-emergent.htm#sdendnote2sym\">2</a></sup> This\n        discussion would have been interesting because such arguments in the\n        Bible fly directly in the face of his anti-rational posture. If offering\n        rational evidence for the truthfulness of Christianity is such a modern\n        and pointless task, why do Jesus and Paul do exactly that repeatedly?\n        Why did God waste so much time and effort recording a prophetic message\n        in advance that would validate Jesus? Wasn&#x2019;t it Jesus who argued, &#x201C;all\n        things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets\n        and the Psalms must be fulfilled&#x201D;? (Luk. 24:44) It was not modernists,\n        but Paul who argued that, &#x201C;that Christ died for our sins according\n        to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third\n        day according to the Scriptures.&#x201D; (1&#xA0;Cor. 15:3,4) If arguing\n        from reason for Jesus is such an unspiritual approach, why does the Bible\n        itself record that Paul, &#x201C;reasoned with them from the Scriptures,\n        explaining and proving that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the\n        dead.&#x201D;? (Acts. 17:2,3) Was it that Newbigin didn&#x2019;t know about\n        these passages and many others that advance an intellectually defensible\n        faith? Or was it that he purposely left them out of his discussion? In\n        fact, biblical teaching has little or no role in Newbigin&#x2019;s discussion\n      on this point.</p>\n      <h2 class=\"western style1\">&#x201C;Story&#x201D; versus Truth</h2>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">Newbigin deplores Newton&#x2019;s\n        suggestion that &#x201C;God provided two ways of making himself known\n        to us: the book which we call the Bible, and the book of nature.&#x201D; This\n        formulation is wrong, he feels, because, &#x201C;We are not, in this view,\n        part of a story, a drama of creation, fall, redemption, and consummation.\n        We are in a timeless world where timeless truths, valid for all times\n        and all peoples, are being communicated in two different ways.&#x201D;<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote3anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/newbigin-emergent.htm#sdendnote3sym\">3</a></sup> Evangelical\n        readers will naturally feel nervous when Newbigin suggests truths about\n        God are not timeless, or that they don&#x2019;t apply to all people. We\n        are left to wonder what God&#x2019;s truth is. Careful readers of the\n        Bible will feel confused as to why Newbigin feels the need to falsely\n        dichotomize story and propositional truth, when we see both advanced\n        together and separately throughout the Bible. What are these &#x201C;stories&#x201D; that\n        are put over against propositional truth? Is it the story of Jesus going\n        to the cross and rising from the dead? Why would such a story be viewed\n        as not advancing &#x201C;timeless truths, valid for all times and all\n      peoples&#x201D;? Clearly, the story language is code for something else.</p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">Newbigin&#x2019;s denial that\n        we can apprehend objective truth is really a rejection of the notion\n        that God has made his character &#x201C;evident within them,&#x201D; or\n        that it &#x201C;is clearly seen through what has been created.&#x201D; (Rom.\n        1:18) Newbigin does not feel that reason in any way points to Christianity,\n        and he implies that any resort to reason in apologetics constitutes a\n      capitulation to the enlightenment.</p>\n      <p class=\"style1\"> I\n        began to see.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. [the domestication] in my own Christianity,\n        that I too had been more ready to seek a &#x201C;reasonable Christianity,&#x201D; a\n        Christianity that could be defended on the terms of my whole intellectual\n      formation as a twentieth-century Englishman.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote4anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/newbigin-emergent.htm#sdendnote4sym\">4</a></sup></p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">Thus, he implies that reason\n        is merely an English (read European) cultural bias, rather than a reliable\n      tool for analyzing the world.</p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">Instead, he argues that Christianity\n        must be based on <i>dogma</i>. Dogma, which resonates with people, or &#x201C;seems\n        right&#x201D; is, according to Newbigin, the style of argument used in\n        the New Testament, and still the most appropriate. He does a good job\n        demonstrating that other secular thinkers also resort to dogma in their\n        so-called &#x201C;factual&#x201D; approaches to science and other disciplines.\n        Likewise, no one can deny that Christian thinking must include faith\n        assumptions at various points. But Newbigin&#x2019;s analysis, like other\n        postmodern thinkers today, leaves us in a world where nothing can be\n        known for sure, nor, for that matter, is anything even comparatively\n        more likely than another. We simply pick our team and bark and screech\n      for our side over against the others.</p>\n      <p class=\"style1\"> Those\n        who, through no wit or wisdom or godliness of their own, have been entrusted\n        with this message can in no way demonstrate its truth on the basis of\n      some other alleged certainties: they can only live it and announce it.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote5anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/newbigin-emergent.htm#sdendnote5sym\">5</a></sup></p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">He claims that,</p>\n      <p class=\"style1\"> The\n        presupposition of all valid and coherent Christian thinking is that God\n        has acted to reveal and effect his purpose for the world in the manner\n      made known in the Bible.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote6anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/newbigin-emergent.htm#sdendnote6sym\">6</a></sup></p>\n      <p class=\"style1\"> But\n        if all this is a presupposition, we are starting with God to arrive at\n        God. All apologetics are a waste of time. Likewise, our basis for faith\n        is identical to Muslims, cultists, or Communists. Faith with reasonable\n        backing, or which is compatible with reason, is no better in this view\n        than completely blind faith. Again, how different this is from Paul&#x2019;s\n        approach! He felt called to &#x201C;persuade men.&#x201D; (2 Cor. 5) Newbigin\n        never explains why someone would begin with an infinite personal God,\n      or with the Bible.</p>\n      <h2 class=\"western style1\">The Sociology of Knowledge</h2>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">In a more serious error,\n        Newbigin foolishly welcomes the sociology of knowledge (by name) and\n      claims that,</p>\n      <p class=\"style1\"> When,\n        in any society, a belief is held to be &#x201C;reasonable,&#x201D; this\n        is a judgment made on the basis of the reigning plausibility structure.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.\n        Reason does not operate in a vacuum. The power of a human mind to think\n        rationally is only developed in a tradition which itself depends on the\n        experience of previous generations.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. The definition of what\n        is reasonable and what is not will be conditioned by the tradition within\n      which the matter is being discussed.&#x201D;<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote7anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/newbigin-emergent.htm#sdendnote7sym\">7</a></sup></p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">Thus, all reason is reduced\n        to nothing but cultural tradition, thinly veiled. This of course leads\n        to a puzzling contradiction in Newbigin&#x2019;s own argument: How is\n        he able to stand back and describe culture&#x2019;s &#x201C;group-think&#x201D; when\n        he, himself must be a part of that group? Clearly, he believes he is\n        doing the very thing he suggests is impossible&#x2014;stepping outside\n        his own culture&#x2019;s plausibility structure. But there&#x2019;s a double\n        irony. Looking deeper, we discover Newbigin is not standing outside modern\n        culture discovering the principles of sociology of knowledge at work.\n        Instead, he is an illustration of his own point as he joins into the\n        group-think of postmodern ideology! But if he is only aping his contemporaries,\n      why should we take him seriously?</p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">His claims in this section\n        are hollow for many reasons. If a culture&#x2019;s plausibility structure\n        determines absolutely what people in that culture are able to accept,\n        why do we see the antithesis of that in our world today? Evangelical\n        Christianity is growing as never before, but almost entirely in the developing\n        world (Asia, Africa, and Latin America).<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote8anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/newbigin-emergent.htm#sdendnote8sym\">8</a></sup> All\n        of these cultures have no place for evangelical Christianity in their\n        reigning plausibility structure. But in the west, where our plausibility\n        structure is centered in our Christian history, Christianity is in decline!\n        This is exactly the opposite of what Newbigin and other postmodern evangelicals\n        predict with their culturally deterministic theories. Neither can they\n        explain why Christianity took root in the first place when the Greco-Roman\n      world had no place for it in their plausibility structure.</p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">Newbigin correctly warns\n        us that we should not try to advance Christianity by domesticating it\n        to the reigning plausibility structure. Instead, we should challenge\n        the reigning structure with the new. Unfortunately, only two paragraphs\n      later he says,</p>\n      <p class=\"style1\"> The\n        dogma, the thing given for our acceptance in faith, is not a set of timeless\n        propositions: it is a story. Here, I think, is the point at which we\n        may well feel that the eighteenth-century defenders of the faith were\n        most wide of the mark. The Christian religion which they sought to defend\n        was a system of timeless metaphysical truths about God, nature, and man.\n        The Bible was a source of information about these timeless truths.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.\n        The Christian faith, rooted in the Bible is&#x2014;I am convinced&#x2014;primarily\n        to be understood as an interpretation of the story&#x2014;the human story\n      set within the story of nature.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote9anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/newbigin-emergent.htm#sdendnote9sym\">9</a></sup></p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">First, Christian thinkers\n        of the 18<sup>th</sup> century taught the Bible was far more than book\n        of &#x201C;information.&#x201D; Theologians from this period were clear\n        in insisting the Bible is good for information, as well as for a personal\n      encounter with God through his word.</p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">Secondly, instead of challenging\n        today&#x2019;s views with the gospel, he has domesticated the gospel to\n        the reigning postmodern plausibility structure. It turns out that the\n        heart of Christianity is story interpretation&#x2014;the very thing at\n        the center of postmodern social analysis! In place of unchangeable, objective\n        propositions, is the script, or narrative, and subjective interpretation.\n        The old, na&#xEF;ve approach was the one based foolishly on a system\n      of timeless metaphysical truths. He claims that </p>\n      <p class=\"style1\"> Philosophers\n        of science have also shown convincingly that the popular dichotomy between &#x201C;facts&#x201D; (as\n        what we know) and &#x201C;beliefs&#x201D; (of which we can only say, &#x201C;this\n      is true for me&#x201D;) rests on an illusion.&#x201D;<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote10anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/newbigin-emergent.htm#sdendnote10sym\">10</a></sup></p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">So, what we thought were\n        facts are really nothing more than subjective choices on our part to\n        believe what we want. This is nothing short of a denial of our ability\n      to know objective truth. And again,</p>\n      <p class=\"style1\"> Facts\n        do not imprint themselves on the brain like images on a photographic\n        plate. They have to be grasped and understood. All so-called facts are\n        interpreted facts.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. What we see as facts depends on the\n      theory we bring to the observation.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote11anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/newbigin-emergent.htm#sdendnote11sym\">11</a></sup></p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">Of course Newbigin is right\n        in saying that facts have to be understood and grasped &#x2013; operations\n        that require interpretation. But his last comment goes way further. We\n        are only able to see as &#x201C;facts&#x201D; what our &#x201C;theory&#x201D; allow\n        us to accept. The implication is clear and frightening: we are completely\n        determined by our cultural pre-learning. What we observe will depend\n        only on what we bring to the observation&#x2014;but wait. Does that include\n        this observation we just read? How can Newbigin make such sweeping truth\n        affirmations without falling victim to his own critique? According to\n        his own analysis, his claim that all facts are interpretation is only\n        his own interpretation&#x2014;only his own belief, &#x201C;about which\n        we can only say, &#x2018;This is true for me.&#x2019;&#x201D; How, then,\n      do we know that pre-learning completely determines what facts we see?</p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">I think Newbigin is painfully\n      wrong.</p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">Ask yourself: was it cultural\n        pre-learning that showed 15<sup>th</sup> century Europe that the world\n        was round? How could it be, when hardly anyone in Europe believed it\n        before Columbus? Why do so many more people believe the earth is round\n        today than then? Is it nothing but our cultural plausibility structure?\n        Is this nothing but the latest interpretation of the story? Or could\n        it have something to do with the &#x201C;fact&#x201D; that the world <i>really\n        is round</i>? Might it not be that observation of facts in this case\n        actually <i>overthrew</i> the reigning plausibility structure? Yes indeed.\n        But such has no place in Newbigin&#x2019;s postmodern acceptance of the\n        sociology of knowledge. According to him, all offers of evidence, whether\n        eyewitness accounts of sailing around the world or satellite photographs\n        would be a complete waste of time. Believers in the round earth could\n      only live and declare their faith, hoping it might resonate with someone.</p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">This is a good example of\n        how postmodern exaggeration sounds plausible until we notice it utterly\n        fails to correspond with key points in history where individuals and\n        even whole cultures have overthrown their own plausibility structures\n      based on new arguments and evidence.</p>\n      <h2 class=\"western style1\">Relativism?</h2>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">Newbigin tries to steer a\n        course that falls short of utter postmodern skepticism, but he finds\n        it difficult to affirm postmodern assumptions and still hold for any\n        objective truth. After saying what we saw above, he goes on to make this\n      statement:</p>\n      <p class=\"style1\"> Nevertheless,\n        I am responsible both for learning the skills and faithfully using the\n        tools for understanding that my culture furnishes, and also for criticizing,\n        refining, and even perhaps changing these tools. This is all my personal\n        responsibility, and the beliefs which I hold are beliefs for which I\n        must accept responsibility.... I am responsible for seeking as far as\n        possible to insure that my beliefs are true, that I am&#x2014;however\n        fumblingly&#x2014;grasping reality and therefore grasping that which is\n      real and true for all human beings...<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote12anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/newbigin-emergent.htm#sdendnote12sym\">12</a></sup></p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">How can this statement be\n        harmonized with the claims we just read, that the distinctions between\n        facts and faith assumptions are illusions? If there is no difference\n        between facts and &#x201C;that which is only true for me,&#x201D; how could\n        I ever tell whether my beliefs are &#x201C;that which is real and true\n        for all human beings&#x201D;? What test would I apply when raising this\n      question? Newbie seems to be speaking from two sides of his mouth.</p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">Am I exaggerating apparent\n        contradiction in Newbigin&#x2019;s work? Not at all. One page earlier\n        Newbigin repudiated the notion of &#x201C;truth as the correspondence\n        between a person&#x2019;s beliefs and the actual facts.&#x201D; This correspondence\n        theory of truth he calls &#x201C;bogus objectivity.&#x201D; And for rhetorical\n        reasons, he places the correspondence theory in the mouth of one of the\n        rankest of all modernists&#x2014;Bertrand Russell! (Nothing is said of\n        the vast majority of evangelical scholars who believe the correspondence\n        definition of truth is exactly what the Bible teaches).<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote13anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/newbigin-emergent.htm#sdendnote13sym\">13</a></sup> Newbigin\n        rejects correspondence because, &#x201C;I cannot apply this definition\n        of truth to test my own perceptions of truth, since <i>there is no way</i> in\n        which I can stand outside my own perception of the facts.&#x201D;<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote14anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/newbigin-emergent.htm#sdendnote14sym\">14</a></sup> (emphasis\n      mine)</p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">But we must wonder, apart\n        from the correspondence theory of truth what does Newbigin mean when\n        he calls us to make sure &#x201C;my beliefs are true?&#x201D; In fact,\n        how does anyone ever realize they are mistaken? How can we ever change\n      our minds about anything?</p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">This self-contradictory form\n        of argumentation is typical of most of the evangelical postmodern writers\n        I have read, and I find it quite frustrating and even infuriating. The\n      argument really follows the form:</p>\n      <p class=\"style1\"> On\n      the one hand, black is white.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.</p>\n      <p class=\"style1\"> But\n        at the same time, we have to remember that black should never be considered\n      white!</p>\n      <p class=\"style1\"> As\n        a result of this approach, critics who complain about the author&#x2019;s\n        acquiescence to postmodern assumptions can be pointed to these apparently\n        orthodox passages to show that they really haven&#x2019;t understood what\n        the author meant. Yet the whole thrust of the work is in the opposite\n        direction. For instance, Emergent authors routinely deny the validity\n        of theology based on propositional truths, but in the same work adamantly\n        claim they accept the historic creeds of the church&#x2014;each one a\n      series of propositional truths!</p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">Newbigin is so self-contradictory\n        one has to wonder whether he actually understands his own subject (a\n        question raised often today by scholars examining Emergent literature).<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote15anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/newbigin-emergent.htm#sdendnote15sym\">15</a></sup> McLaren\n        responds to these observations by claiming he is championing a different\n        kind of postmodernism. He claims the postmodernism the rest of us (including\n        non Christian scholars) refer to is a figment of our imagination. He\n        says, &#x201C;This definition of postmodernism (it denies truth, denies\n        reality, denies morality) is useful, I think, to scare people so they&#x2019;ll\n        stay loyal to their modern institutions&#x2026;.&#x201D; He thinks this\n        kind of &#x201C;postmodernism probably doesn&#x2019;t exist outside the\n        imaginations of frightened modern people and those who seek to intimidate\n        them &#x2013; plus among some college freshmen who get carried away after\n        drinking too much.&#x201D;<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote16anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/newbigin-emergent.htm#sdendnote16sym\">16</a></sup> And\n        yet his own and Newbigin&#x2019;s books teach exactly that, as we have\n      just seen&#x2014;the difference between facts and assumptions is an illusion. </p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">Even the milder second form\n        of postmodernism that is deconstructive and denies metanarratives, is\n        hard to find, according to McLaren. &#x201C;Outside of sophomore English\n        and graduate philosophy classes, you don&#x2019;t find this form of postmodernism\n        much any more.&#x201D; This part made me wonder if McLaren ever spends\n        time with non Christian students and younger people. For him to claim\n        that those who think &#x201C;there is no such thing as objective truth&#x201D; are\n        rare is incomprehensible. That is exactly what most students today believe,\n        at least in our area. Where are these more mature postmodernists who\n        see through the fallacy of relativism? In street interviews at our university,\n        barely one in twenty students hold for any view other than complete relativism.\n        I think it&#x2019;s incredible that McLaren would dare to suggest that\n      postmodern people today are not relativists.</p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">I suspect that McLaren <i>et\n          al</i>. are embarrassed by the discrepancies now demonstrated in their\n          own analysis of postmodernism, and are reacting by inventing a form\n          of postmodernism that is more domesticated and amorphous, mainly for\n          rhetorical purposes. David Mills, who admits he doesn&#x2019;t understand\n          postmodernism very well,<sup> <a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote17anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/newbigin-emergent.htm#sdendnote17sym\">17</a></sup> echoes\n          McLaren&#x2019;s denial that postmodernism has to do with epistemology.\n          He thinks the fact that cultural events have come along during the\n          same period somehow negates the epistemological nature of postmodernism.\n          We are left in the pitiful position where once again, Christians have\n          their own definitions for mainstream words, and must take our place\n          as a linguistic backwater, busily talking to ourselves, but incomprehensible\n          to the rest of the world. Is there even one secular scholar who would\n          agree with these bizarre claims about the nature of postmodernism?\n          I think not. Christians should reject the formation of an intellectual\n          ghetto where we assign our own meaning to words commonly used in secular\n      culture.</p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">Like Buddhist koans, Newbigin&#x2019;s\n        self-contradictions pile up one on another. On one hand he argues that, &#x201C;The\n        relativism which is not willing to speak about truth but only about &#x2018;what\n        is true for me&#x2019; is an evasion of the serious business of living.\n        It is the mark of a tragic loss of nerve in our contemporary culture.&#x201D;<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote18anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/newbigin-emergent.htm#sdendnote18sym\">18</a></sup> But\n        how are we to avoid relativism if we accept his claim that the correspondence\n        view of truth, &#x201C;implies a standpoint outside the real human situation\n        of knowing subjects&#x2014;and no such standpoint is available.&#x201D;<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote19anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/newbigin-emergent.htm#sdendnote19sym\">19</a></sup> I\n        wonder, if truth doesn&#x2019;t have to correspond to reality, from what\n        ground then, do we resist or refute relativism? Why can&#x2019;t Newbigin\n        see that the position he just affirmed (that there is no way to know\n        if something actually corresponds with reality) is exactly what makes\n        relativism inevitable? This failure to connect the dots again makes it\n      look like he actually doesn&#x2019;t understand his own subject matter.</p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">I think Newbigin answers, &#x201C;The\n        Christian, on the other hand, will relativize the reigning plausibility\n        structure In the light of the gospel.&#x201D;<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote20anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/newbigin-emergent.htm#sdendnote20sym\">20</a></sup> Is\n        this different, or the same as that relativism he has just deplored?\n        If our worldview &#x201C;relativises&#x201D; the rest of culture, aren&#x2019;t\n        we saying the other world views are held relative to our view? How is\n        this different than anyone else&#x2019;s relativism? He has already dismissed\n        the possibility that other views are relative to any objective absolute.\n        If all views are relative to other views that are also relative, in what\n        sense has he avoided relativism? Again, if we hold our faith without\n        any rational basis, only because &#x201C;it resonates with me,&#x201D; as\n        he earlier suggested, what makes us think we are any different from the\n      millions of relativists populating the postmodern west?</p>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">In view of the latent relativism\n        in Emergent theology, we should not feel surprised to see their top leaders\n      accepting universalism and denying the substitutionary death of Jesus.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote21anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/newbigin-emergent.htm#sdendnote21sym\">21</a></sup></p>\n      <h2 class=\"western style1\">Newbigin&#x2019;s view of the church</h2>\n      <p class=\"western style1\">When Newbigin turns to the\n        church, his work is no less disturbing. His assessment of liberal theology\n      is way too lenient and sympathetic, in my view.</p>\n      <p class=\"style1\"> I\n        am referring to the deep and tragic split which divides Christians between\n        those who are usually labeled liberals and fundamentalists.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.\n        There are on the one hand those who seek to identify God&#x2019;s revelation\n        as a series of objectively true propositions, propositions which are\n        simply to be accepted by those who wish to be Christians. And on the\n        other hand there are those who see the essence of Christianity in an\n        inward spiritual experience, personal to each believer, and who see the\n        Christian doctrines as formulated during church history as symbolic representations\n      of these essentially inward and private experiences.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote22anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/newbigin-emergent.htm#sdendnote22sym\">22</a></sup></p>\n      <p class=\"style1\"> I&#x2019;m\n        sorry to see that Newbigin sees only two categories&#x2014;fundamentalists\n        (of which any who believe in objective, propositional truth are a part)\n        or liberals. I find it interesting that, according to Newbigin, it is\n        the Liberals who &#x201C;see the essence of Christianity in an inward\n        spiritual experience, personal to each believer.&#x201D; Is there any\n        conservative theologian who would deny this aspect? On the other hand,\n        he fails to mention the outright denial of biblical truthfulness on the\n        part of liberals (although to any able to read between the lines, this\n        is the meaning when doctrines are &#x201C;symbolic representations&#x201D;).\n        He says nothing of liberal theologians&#x2019; arrogant denial of the\n        possibility of miracles, or their advancing their own propositional truths,\n        like religious Darwinism, or that the biblical books could not possibly\n        have been written by their claimed authors. His sympathetic portrayal\n        of liberals combined with his frequent denunciations of &#x201C;fundamentalists&#x201D; also\n      leaves little doubt as to where his own sympathies lie.</p>\n      <p class=\"style1\"> Finally,\n        Newbigin also falls into the pit so many postmodern Christian thinkers\n        are falling into. In the vacuum of authority left by their denial of\n        an objective message in the Bible, they are driven to a new authority:\n        the interpretive community. The interpretive community, or tradition,\n        that we stand in, and which absolutely determines our interpretation,\n        is the historic church. Therefore, Newbigin is like many who find themselves\n        on the road back to Rome, or Eastern Orthodoxy. Why respect more recent\n        traditions when they were based on the specious assumption of <i>sola\n        scriptura</i>? Isn&#x2019;t <i>sola scriptura</i> (the reformation doctrine\n        that the Bible alone, apart from tradition, has authority for Christians)\n        the very thing Newbigin argues against and attributes to fundamentalists?\n        Any belief that a text, whether ancient or modern, could yield a message\n        that is in any way objective or determinative is considered pure modernist\n        rationalism by Newbigin and other Emergent thinkers. Even if this deprecation\n        of scripture as sufficient and clear were their only error, the Emergent\n      movement would deserve powerful opposition from evangelical believers.</p>\n      \n      <div class=\"style1\" id=\"sdendnote1\">\n        <p class=\"sdendnote-western\"><a class=\"sdendnotesym\" name=\"sdendnote1sym\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/newbigin-emergent.htm#sdendnote1anc\">1</a> Stanley\n          Grenz and Brian McLaren are among the most popular authors arguing\n          along similar lines.

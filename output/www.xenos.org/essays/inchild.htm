This \n  is a position which will cause consternation on the part of some modern readers. \n  Today in our culture, focusing on ourselves is viewed as the key to happiness \n  and health. Today, many people believe they will solve their problems by \"centering\" \n  themselves, or \"gaining a sense of self.\" </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">According to these theories, my quest should be to find my true self and liberate that\nself from the layers of repression and abuse heaped on me by others. The key is to\ndiscover my inner child--the true me--and become my own parent. Only by attacking my\nshame-based upbringing will I finally throw off the negative labeling and repressive rules\nholding me down (the repressive parent within) and find freedom to express my creativity\nand my \"true\" feelings. I need to champion the inner child so I can get in touch\nwith my feelings which have been shamed and denied to me for so long. Only then will I\nfinally differentiate my ego from the undifferentiated ego-mass of my family of origin. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">These and related ideas have grown out of a combination of three streams of thinking\nwhich have fused into a mighty river with the virtual status of religion in our culture.\nThe first tributary was the family systems school of psychoanalysis. The second was the\nrecovery movement and its daughter, the codependency movement. Finally, these have been\njoined by what we might call New Age selfism, or radical individualism. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Although there are many professionals who would reject such theories, popular culture\nseems to be reaching a level of agreement rarely, if ever, seen before in this century.\nFor example, author John Bradshaw, who has been called the high priest of inner child\ntherapy has written a number of books which have all spent time on the New York Times best\nseller list, often as number 1 for months at a time. These are some of the most popular\nnon-fiction books written in recent history. [I draw my descriptions of Bradshaw's\nmaterial primarily from the following two works. John Bradshaw, <i>Creating Love: The Next\nGreat Stage of Growth</i>, (New York:, Bantam Books) 1992 and <i>Healing the Shame that\nBinds You</i>, (Deerfield Beech, CA: Health Communications, Inc. 1988)].</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Biblical and Critical Assessment</h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Christian thinkers are confused about these therapeutic suggestions. On one side is the\nobservation that some people, especially victims of acute abuse as children, seem to\nforget sections of their early lives, or idealize a past which is known to have been\nhorrible. This is usually a sign of repression or denial; defense mechanisms which can\nthreaten people's ability to stay in touch with reality and to relate to others honestly.\nThose who are reeling from painful abuse in childhood may live in a numbed and unemotional\nstate, or their lives may be filled with irrational, displaced rage or anxiety. Only the\nmost extreme Christian leaders would deny that such denial states exist. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">On the other hand, there are developments in this field that alarm most evangelical\nthinkers. Today it seems, not only the severely abused, but virtually everyone is\nconsidered a trauma victim on one level or another. What may have been needed for some\nextreme cases of dissociation now is believed to be the key to everyone's life. Yet these\nrecently discovered therapeutic or self-help procedures are sometimes suspicious. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Thoughtful evangelicals today worry that what began as a legitimate therapy for certain\nvictims may be becoming a fad which puts self and negative past experiences at the center\nof personal growth. Christians have been quick to adapt the thinking of secular and New\nAge teachers, like Bradshaw to the Christian therapeutic market. Re-parenting theories now\nturn out to be the crux of Jesus' teaching as well as the plumb-line by which churches and\nteachers are judged. Yet several searching questions can be asked of self-restructuring\nand family systems theorists: \n</p><ol class=\"style1\">\n  <ol>\n    <li><b>Are inner child and parental shame theories biblical?</b> It would \n      be wrong to claim the Bible has to mention something before it can be trusted. \n      The Bible doesn't mention bulimia, but that doesn't mean there's no such \n      thing. On the other hand, if freedom from shame induced by my parents is \n      the key to growth, not just for the severely abused, but for virtually everyone, \n      how did people get along for so many centuries without this knowledge? Bradshaw \n      argues that western culture just began to awaken from its patriarchal trance \n      at the time of the American and French revolution, and that most of our \n      important realizations have occurred since World War II! Is it possible \n      that a discovery made only in the 1960's and 70's by largely secular and \n      New Age thinkers is the key to personal growth for most or all people? If \n      so, what good is the Bible--a \"revelation\" which completely missed \n      this central truth? </li>\n    <li><b>Many of the definitions given for \"shaming\" are so broad \n      they seem to disallow virtually all parental discipline, and even the categories \n      of good and evil.</b> Some authors, including evangelicals, have championed \n      definitions of illegitimate \"shaming\" such as \"any statement \n      which says there's something wrong with you.\" How can this definition \n      from a recent evangelical book be reconciled with the fact that there <i>is</i> \n      something wrong with us? How would Jesus fare in the face of such definitions? \n      He said the world hated him because he testified that their deeds were evil. \n      (John 7:7) His sermon decrying the Pharisees in Matthew 23 would apparently \n      be shaming and labeling of the worst sort. He also warned that he did not \n      come to call the righteous, but sinners. (Matthew 9:13) Is there still a \n      place for admitting sin without feeling we are either shaming ourselves \n      or being shamed? If not, Christ has nothing to offer us. </li>\n    <li><b>Is it appropriate to view ourselves as more or less ideal when we were \n      pre-school children?</b> Isn't the notion that \"I have to champion \n      the true person I was as a child,\" based on the belief that people \n      begin good and become bad because of repressive parenting? Bradshaw expressly \n      affirms that this is the basis for his theories. But how does this theory \n      accord with passages like Proverbs 22:15 \"Foolishness is bound up in \n      the heart of a child; The rod of discipline will remove it far from him?\" \n      Such a statement sounds like the <i>antithesis</i> of modern inner-child \n      theory. So, too, does Paul's boast that \"When I was a child, I used \n      to speak as a child, think as a child, reason as a child; when I became \n      a man, I did away with childish things.\" (I Corinthians 13:11) The \n      Bible teaches that children are born fallen and need to have their anti-social \n      selfishness brought under control through training and loving discipline. \n      Children view themselves as the center of the universe and think everyone \n      should cater to their feelings. They can't tell the difference between their \n      feelings and reality. Many Christian thinkers wonder whether modern theory \n      is suggesting that this is the ideal we should all seek. </li>\n    <li><b>Beneath the shame theories in the secular market is the unproved assumption \n      that all shame feelings originate from outside myself.</b> Authors like \n      Bradshaw decry the biblical notion of innate sinfulness as the worst sort \n      of paternalistic negative conditioning. He is adamant that the shaming voices \n      within are those of our persons of origin--our parents. But even if this \n      is true <i>sometimes</i>, how do we know shame isn't also native to the \n      fallen human condition? <b>When Adam hid under a bush, it wasn't from Eve, \n      but from God.</b> When we dare to assume powers that are not ours, including \n      the right to be our own gods, we feel unavoidable hard feelings, especially \n      when confronted with the true owner of those powers and titles--the God \n      of the universe. This feeling, so universal and unavoidable, is shame. Why \n      look only to our outer environment for the source of shame instead of realizing \n      that much of our shame comes from the inner knowledge that we are sinners?    </li>\n    <li><b>According to inner child theorists, the key to release from shame is \n      entering into my own pain and rage.</b> By finally feeling in a deep way \n      my own feelings rather than the feelings of my parents, I differentiate \n      my ego from the ego-mass of my family. But this theory is not proven. Some \n      people appear to dwell on their pain and rage in a way that is quite destructive. \n      If we compiled a list of passages in the Bible which teach on the need to \n      enter more deeply into our suffering and pain and we compared it to a list \n      of passages teaching on the importance of gratitude, thankfulness and worship, \n      how would the lists compare? Isn't it true that, according to the Bible, \n      the emphasis for most people should be on developing appreciation for what \n      God has done, or will do for us, not dwelling on our misfortunes? At the \n      risk of being diagnosed as being \"in denial\" I would point out \n      that even verses on the role of pain and suffering focus more on how to \n      endure and respond to pain than on any need to \"enter into\" it. \n      Such an emphasis need not imply that Christians should practice denial. \n      Paul, Christ and others in Scripture acknowledged they felt pain. It is \n      rather a call to recognize the balance in Scripture, which is heavily weighted \n      in the direction of our need to resist our native negativity, lack of gratitude \n      and self-centeredness. </li>\n  </ol>\n</ol>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Christians have to think about themselves, just like everyone else. But there is such a\nthing as self-absorption in the negative sense, and this is a form of setting our minds on\nthe things of the flesh. There may be certain people who need to focus on themselves and\ntheir past episodes of abuse for a period of time. The rationale for this is that only\nwhen they reach a greater level of resolution will they be able to leave such things in\nthe past for good. But for most people most of the time, God wants us to be liberated from\na self-centered focus, and develop a Christ-centered focus. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=my%20problems\">Ask\nDennis a question or share a comment.</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/counseling/counsdpt.htm\">Return to the Counseling Ministries \n  page</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to the Xenos home page</a>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"My Problems With Self-first and Inner-Child Theories","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/inchild.htm"}

He was well educated, holding the Doctor of Theology from the University of\nStrassbourg, and he had some strong notions that would soon galvanize Europe into another\nsurge of reforming zeal--eventually reaching millions in every corner of the globe. The\npastor's name was Philip Jacob Spener. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Nine years into his first pastorate, Spener would set forth his call for reform in the\nLutheran church in a forward to a collection of sermons by Johannes Arndt. The title of\nthe introduction was <i>Pia Desideria</i>, (Pious Desires) and within weeks this\nremarkable little tractate set off an astounding reaction throughout most of Europe.1 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Modern members of primitive New Testament-style churches will quickly recognize several\nimportant themes in this tract, which have stirred strong sentiments today, as they have\nthroughout church history. These ideas include the need for small meetings in the local\nchurch that will allow the re-introduction of the inter-active style of koinonia described\nin I Cor. 14, the need for the laity to learn the Bible and use it, the necessity of\ncongregational review of the public teacher's positions, a vigorous critique of the\ninstitutional church and others. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">It is the purpose of this paper to identify the key themes of Spener's theology,\nfocusing in the area of ecclesiology. Then, a further attempt will be made to understand\nthe connection between Spener's ecclesiological position and those streams that gave rise\nto it, as well as those that flowed out from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Spener's background</h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Born in 1635 in a practicing Christian home,2 Spener grew up in the aftermath of the\nThirty Years War.3 It is hard to exaggerate the deadening effect that this international\nholocaust had on the view of the average person in Germany toward religion. Stoeffler\nsays, </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>It is difficult to overestimate the catastrophic effect of the Thirty Years War upon\n  the German people, The country being at the mercy of the (sic) Europe's soldiery, the\n  destruction was such that whole villages and even towns simply disappeared. 4 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The thirty years war was only one manifestation of the unhealthy relationship between\nchurch and state at that time. In the sixteenth century the Reformers had turned to the\nGerman princes, as \"the chief members of the church,\" to take a hand in the\nreform of the church in their lands. This move was necessary because, at that time,\ndivergent religious movements were routinely exterminated by armies loyal to the Roman\nCatholic Church. The fact is that if the leaders of the Reformation had not had the armies\nof European nobles on their side (especially in Saxony), they probably would have gone the\nway of previous dissident religious movements like the Albigensians and the\nWaldensians--genocide.5 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">It is hard for the modern reader to appreciate what life would have been like in a time\nwhen religious toleration was unheard of. Yet it was this fact that originally made\npartnership with the state indispensable.6 Unfortunately, while preserving the reformation\nchurch, this appeal for state assistance had led in time to a condition of permanent\ncontrol. By the second half of the seventeenth century many of the rulers were members of\nthe church only in a nominal sense, yet they held ecclesiastical legislation (rules for\nchurch discipline) firmly in their grasp. They also made the choice of who would hold\noffices in the church. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Church and state were united in such a way that the state controlled the church, and\nthe ministers of the church became officials of the state.7 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">One example of state meddling in the church was the legal requirement that everyone\nattend church, and pay tithes.8 Not surprisingly, for most, this state of affairs tended\nto lead to a superficial involvement in the church. Another lamentable feature were the\nterrorizing heretic hunts and witch hunts which periodically engulfed and brutalized a\ngiven territory. 9 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The <i>Christian state </i>concept had also removed the perceived need to convert the\nlost in society. It was assumed that most if not all those in church were authentic\nChristians. Here, the modern reader has less problem identifying with Spener's world. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The unfortunate relationship between church and state was not the only factor leading\nto the growth of nominal Christianity. Lutheran theology and practice were both\nproblematic at this time, as witnessed by many besides Spener. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">In the seminaries, the students were trained to do theology in Latin, as they had been\nfor hundreds of years. \"Disputations\" or debates with other schools of theology\nwere the order of the day. These disputations were not only carried out against Reformed,\nAnabaptist, and Roman Catholic, but also against other Lutherans. They could be carried\nout in person, or in writing, and tended to become more and more vituperative.10 The\nclergy who had been trained this way also tended to bring these disputes into the pulpit.\nMany sermons were scathing sarcastic attacks on rival views, detailed often with latin\nquotations that the people did not understand or care about.11 This form of\nteaching--arid, non-biblical, and unapplied--was compared by some to the <i>schul\nTheologie </i>(scholastic, or school theology) that the Reformation had claimed to\nreplace. 12 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">In church life, a rigid distinction between clergy and laity tends to be quite\nunmotivating for the laity, especially when it is not felt that the lay person can do\nanything of importance. Yet, not only was this distinction maintained as tightly as ever,\nbut other class distinctions were evident as well. Tappert explains, </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>. . .class distinctions were manifest in the churches, where elevated and upholstered\n  places were reserved for the upper classes and only the common people sat on hard seats in\n  the nave.13 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Stoeffler adds, </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>Some of the noble families of Saxony. . . would not not have their children baptized at\n  church because this would involve baptism with the same water used for other children. 14 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">There would have been little enthusiasm for spiritual growth, let alone ministry for\nthe average lay person during this period. Stoeffler summarizes the situation, </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>The popular idea within the territorial churches was that a Christian is anyone who has\n  been baptized and who maintains some formal connection with the Church by making use at\n  least occasionally of the means of grace [[communion, the Word, and baptism] and who\n  believes in general the truths laid down in the doctrinal symbols of his communion and\n  adheres to its cultic forms.15 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Naturally, with the flame of the church burning dimly, people became interested in\nother things. It is not clear whether the drinking bouts and \"rioting\" that\nSpener complained about were worse than usual, but there is no good reason to doubt that\nthey were, especially since this part of Spener's thesis was not questioned by his\ncritics. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The overall situation then, in Germany and much of the rest of Europe, was general\napathy on the spiritual level. Bickering between theologians had lost the interest of the\npeople, and Christianity itself was discredited by the violence of the religious wars. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Yet, even though the people were tired of murderous fanaticism, the nominal,\nformalistic religion that was prevalent was not satisfying either. This fact is attested\nto by scores of written lamentations about the sorry state of the church from this period.\nAs Noll has stated, </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>In fact, German pietism was but one chord in a symphony of variations on a common\n  theme--the need to move beyond sterile formulas about God to a more intimate experience\n  with him.16 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Some of the cries for spiritual reality were radical and even unbiblical such as those\nof Valentine Weigel and Jacob Boehme who were theosophical mystics. Other mystical authors\nwere more moderate in their position. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Spener's favorite book while growing up was by one such author. The book, which was in\nSpener's father's library, was John Arndt's <i>True Christianity</i>, the echoes of which\nare evident in virtually all of Spener's writings. <i>Pia Desideria</i> itself was written\nas an introduction to a collection of Arndt's sermons. Spener was also deeply affected by\nthe religious views of one countess Agathe. Her Christianity has been characterized as\n\"world-fleeing, quietistic, even mystical.\"17 Spener also lists as a key\ninfluence, his parish pastor, Stoll, who was a strict Lutheran with a practical bent.\nFinally, there were several other devotional authors who influenced Spener during this\nperiod. Briefly, they are, Emmanuel Sothom's <i>Golden Crown-Jewels of the Children of God</i>,\n(which was written that \"those who are Christian in name might become Christian also\nin deeds and in truth,\") and Lewis Bailey's <i>The Practice of Piety</i>. 18 Any\nstudent of Spanner's work will recognize the themes of these British quietists readily. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Spener was a sharp student, and by the age of just 16 he was urged to enter the\nUniversity. There he studied under well known Lutheran scholars, especially Dannhaur, who\nmade him read the works of Luther. Spener was so taken by Luther that he would later claim\nthat no other author since biblical times was as enlightened as he. It can fairly be said\nthat Spener received his orthodox material (including his ecclesiology) from Luther\nthrough Dannhaur.19 As he moved toward completion of his education \"he became\nincreasingly biblically oriented and the theological writing which he engaged in becomes\nincreasingly exegetical and practical. Gunberg notes that despite the fact that Spener was\na contemporary of \"Hobbies, Lock, Spines, and Albinos . . .and Bacon, Herbert of\nCherry, and Descartes . . .[were] causing a philosophical revolution, Spener took almost\nno notice of their philosophical labors.\" 20 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">After graduation from class work, Spener took the customary 2 years of travels. One\ninteresting stop in his journeys was in Geneva, where he was exposed to the charismatic\nFrench mystic, Jean de Labadie. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Labadie later became a mystical extremist, and a separatist (i.e. revolutionary against\nthe established church). His doctrinal influence on Spener's will be considered later. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Spener was called to the pastorate in Frankfurt am Main in 1666. He immediately began\nto hold forth his views, which apparently remained relatively unchanged over the next 25\nyears. It was at Frankfurt that he began his <i>collage </i>pietatis in 1670 and published\nthe <i>Pia </i>Desired.21 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Within months, the <i>Pia Desideria</i> was known throughout the Lutheran church. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">The Elements of Spener's Program</h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Spener was catapulted into fame, as already stated, by the publication of <i>Pia\nDesideria</i> in 1676. This little book has some very special qualities as described by\nAland, </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>Spener stands altogether in the stream of a tradition, but with the means at our\n  disposal it is not possible to demonstrate with certainty when he was actually dependent\n  on it. This much is clear. But it is just as clear that he represents a unique phenomenon.\n  Countless books were written on the same theme before and after Spener. None of them,\n  however, even approaches the <i>Pia Desideria</i> in the conciseness and clarity of its\n  thought and the grasp of its goal. . . All the ideas and all the proposals for a reform of\n  existing conditions had been present again and again before him. . . Yet nobody but Spener\n  was capable of putting them together in the way in which we find them in the <i>Pia\n  Desideria</i>.22 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The <i>Pia Desideria</i> contains the clearest summary of Spener's theology. Here the\nparts of the book are mentioned with short representative statements which give the\nfeeling, or flavor of the work. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Spener begins with an introduction that cautions the clergy that they will not have to\nanswer to God for how proficient they were at winning debates, </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>\"Instead, we shall be asked how faithfully and with how childlike a heart we\n  sought to further the kingdom of God; with how pure and godly a teaching and how worthy an\n  example we tried to edify our hearers amid the scorn of the world...23 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Spener's pattern of looking past the external and unimportant to the spiritual\nrealities underlying the situation is immediately apparent. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">After the introduction, the first section contains a lengthy lamentation over the\ncondition of all three estates in German-Lutheran society. Of the first estate, the\nnobility, Spener complains that they do not use their governmental authority in the\ninterest of building a Christian society. </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>How many of them there are who do not concern themselves at all with what is spiritual,\n  who hold with Gallio that they have nothing to do with anything but the temporal!24 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">As already mentioned, the relation between the church and the state was a close one in\nSpener's day, and he saw nothing wrong with this, except for the fact that the nobility\nwere not holding up their end of the bargain. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Of the second estate, the clergy, his main critique is that they have replaced the\nsimple and clear preaching of the gospel with a morbid interest in controversial\nnit-picking. One source of this is the one-sided impractical education that the clergy\nreceive at seminary. </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>When men's minds are stuffed with such a theology which, while it preserves the\n  foundation of faith from the Scriptures, builds on it with so much wood, hay, and stubble\n  of human inquisitiveness that the gold can no longer be seen, it becomes exceedingly\n  difficult to grasp and find pleasure in the real simplicity of Christ and his teaching.\n  This is so because men's taste becomes accustomed to the more charming things of reason,25\n  and after a while the simplicity of Christ and his teaching appears to be tasteless. Such\n  knowledge, which remains without love, \"puffs up\" (I Cor. 8:1). It leaves man in\n  his love of self; indeed, it fosters and strengthens such love more and more. Subtleties\n  unknown to the Scriptures usually have their origin, in the case of those who introduce\n  them, in a desire to exhibit their sagacity and their superiority over others, to have a\n  great reputation, and to derive benefit therefrom in the world. . .They can hardly be kept\n  from taking to market what gives them the most pleasure, and they generally concentrate on\n  something that is not very edifying to their hearers who are seeking salvation.\"26 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Finally, of the third estate, the peasants and the bourgeoisie, Spener deplores the\nlack of biblical morality. Examples that he focuses on include the presence of beggars and\nother poor who are ignored by the working Christians,27 heavy drinking and\n\"riot,\"28 and superficiality in the observance of church ordinances: </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">This leads many people to damnation and even strengthens a false and illusory\nconception of what constitutes true faith. There are many who think that this comprises\nall there is to christianity and thus they have done enough if they have been baptized,\nlisten to the divine word in sermons, confessed, received the absolution, and gone to Holy\nCommunion. 29 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">It is confusing to hear Spener argue against doctrinal wrangling and superficiality in\na way very fit unto the modern fundamentalist church, and then turn around and attack\ndrinking! One wonders whether he would reject or embrace modern fundamentalist churches. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Spener's denunciation of all forms of sin is thorough. Yet he does not believe in\nperfectionism. In the next section of the <i>Pia Desideria</i>, he sets forward a vision\nof a reformed Lutheran church. </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>If one wants to seek perfection one must abandon this life for the next. There alone\n  can one find perfection but prior to eternity we cannot hope to have it. 30 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">On the other hand, </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>Therefore he is never further away from the conceit of perfection than when he works\n  the most zealously to achieve perfection.31 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">He summarizes what he would like to see, </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>We know full well that a wheat field can never be discovered which is so clean that not\n  a single weed can be found in it. But rather we advance to the point that the church is\n  nonetheless free of public scandal and no one expected with scandal is living is left in\n  the church without grave misgivings and finally exclusion, and the true members of the\n  church realize that the degree of perfection with much fruitfulness.32 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">How was the Lutheran church to correct these deficiencies? In answer to this question,\nSpener supplied a series of proposals in the third section of the <i>Pia Desideria</i>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; First, there should be more focus on\nknowledge of the word not only for the clergy, but also for the laity. They should be\ntaught to read it privately, and the\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; clergy should read it and explain\nit publicly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">It is in this connection that Spener brought forward two of his most dramatic and\nfar-reaching proposals--that the church renew Luther's emphasis on the priesthood of all\nbelievers, and that they do so through the initiation of <i><a name=\"DDE_LINK4\">collegia\npietatis</a></i>. These were small interactive meetings of lay Christians focusing on\ndoing exposition of the Bible, admonition, and prayer. The meeting format described in I\nCor. 14 was cited as the model for these meetings, which would meet in member's homes. </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>. . .perhaps it would even be useful if we again brought in to being the ancient\n  apostolic way of gathering the church together, which leads to mature thinking. In\n  addition to the customary sermons other gatherings would be held in the same way Paul in I\n  Cor. 13 describes them. Instead of just one getting up to teach, which will still be done\n  at other times, others who are blessed with talents and insight would also contribute.\n  They would present their pious thoughts which might be instructive to the rest concerning\n  the matters discussed without disorderliness or quarreling. . .What each one contributed\n  would be examined by the rest especially by those whose calling was teaching, as to the\n  conformity with the intent of the Holy Spirit in the scriptures and thus the whole group\n  would be edified.33 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Spener argued that this kind of structure was necessary because the people were not\nlearning the Bible through the customary Sunday meetings. </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>Now if one gathers together all the texts which have been presented in many years one\n  after another to one congregation there will be only a small part of the scripture which\n  has been expounded. The congregation does not hear the rest at all, or they hear only a\n  few sayings or directives which are mentioned in the sermon without being able to\n  understand their whole significance even though there is something important in them. .\n  .The people have little opportunity to grasp the understanding of the scripture in any\n  other way then from the text that are interpreted to them. That they even have less\n  opportunity to use the scriptures themselves as their edification requires.34 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">It was also needed in order to establish what Luther had called the \"Spiritual\nPriesthood\" as a reality rather than a dead letter. This must be done because, </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>. . .one of the foremost reasons why the minister cannot accomplish everything and\n  carry out what should be easy, is that he is too weak without the help of the universal\n  priesthood of all believers. One man is not enough among so many since to just one is\n  usually entrusted the accomplishment of everything necessary for the edification of the\n  people under his care.35 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The fourth proposal had to do with the moral lives of the people. Here, Spener calls\nfor clear teaching and admonition regarding loving God, and one's neighbor. </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>. . .when we awaken a fervent love among Christians--first for each other, then toward\n  all mankind--both of which (love of bothers and love of mankind) must follow one another\n  (II Pet. 1:7) - and bring it into practice. . .then almost everything we desire is\n  accomplished.36 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Changes in behavior when carrying out disputations was the fifth part of Spener's\nprogram. He agreed with Arndt that not all disputing is useful,\"37 but felt that\nleaders should not abandon the practice of debate altogether because, </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>. . .the defense of the pure truth and thus also the disputation which are part of its\n  defense, must be maintained within the church just as much as other functions ordained for\n  the edification of the church. Christ, the apostles, and their followers stand out as\n  blessed examples who also disputed, powerfully refuted the opposing errors and defended\n  the truth. On the other hand those who want to take away and condemn this necessary use of\n  the spiritual sword of the divine Word would plunge the Christian church into the greatest\n  danger, in as much as it should be used against false teaching.38 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">However, they should use loving demeanor, should give no offense, whether it be from\nname calling, or an unloving lack of desire to win the disputant. He thought they should\nrealize the limitations of disputations, and should accept those from other confessions\nwho are close enough to be Christians. Finally, the disputer should practice love and good\nworks to back up his argument.39 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The fifth proposal dealt with correcting the deficiencies in the clergy. Spener argued\nthat the seminaries should choose only qualified students, that is, morally qualified. An\neffort should be made to find out what their lives were like before they were admitted.\nOnce there, the professors should supervise the lives of students, insisting on piety in\naddition to scholarship.40 They should terminate partying, joking around and\n\"rioting,\" and should even give certificates from the seminary stating that the\ngraduate was qualified to minister because of his godly life.41 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">He felt that disputing should be the focus of only the few in seminary, and that the\nothers focus on knowing how to teach Christianity in German to their people. Thus, the\nfocus of seminary would be to produce practical preachers, not idle, picky\nintellectuals.42 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">In order to school the private walk of the students, Spener recommends late medieval\nmystical books like Tauler, <i>Theologica Deutsch</i> (The German Theology) and Thomas a\nKempis, <i>Imitation of Christ</i>. These books, along with the Bible, are what in\nSpener's mind probably made Luther who he was. Arndt's own book is also of the sort\ndesired.43 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Finally, the sixth proposal is that existing clergy should preach sermons planned to\nfurther faith and fruit in the hearers. Like the sermons in Arndt's Postille, for which <i>Pia\nDesideria</i> was an introduction, they should not be designed to show how knowledgeable\nthe preacher was, but to edify. In other words, sermons should be practical, while\nfocusing on inner change, as well as outer. No sermon should ever be devoid of\napplication.44 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">At last, Spener gives a short literary and bibliographical introduction to the volume\nof Arndt's sermons. He comments that, \"In these spiritually enriching writings . .\n.he [Arndt] has directed everything to the true center, to the inner person.\"45 </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/spen_a.htm\">Go back to the Spener table of contents</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/spen2.htm\">Read on to the next section in \"Spener\"</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\">Go back to the Essays page</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=philip\">Ask Dennis a\nquestion or share a comment.</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Go back to the Xenos home page</a>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Philip Jacob Spener's Contribution to the Protestant Doctrine of the Church","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/spen1.htm"}

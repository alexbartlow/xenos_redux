All quotations from <i>The New American Standard Bible</i>, (Lockman\nFoundation, 1963) It is also noticeable from a historical point of view as Norbeck points\nout, \"Early Christianity involved no objectification by means of paintings and\nstatuary...\" Yet this was changed radically before long.

Haddon, <i>Magic and Fetishism</i>, (Constable &amp; Company Ltd.\nLeicester Square, W.C. 1921) p. 92 </p>\n\n<p>23 Alfred C. Haddon, <i>Magic and Fetishism</i>, p. 77 He also says, \"Animism sees\nall things animated by spirits; fetishism sees a spirit incorporated in an individual\nobject.\" p. 77 \"The material objects which form the tutelary deities or Boshun\nof the natives of the Gold Coast are not symbols of gods which usually reside elsewhere;\neach is the actual receptacle or ordinary abiding-place of an indwelling god.\" p. 78\nHe explains that these containers are prayed to, sacrificed to, and venerated like any\nother deity. </p>\n\n<p>24 Eliade, Mircea. <i>Patterns in Comparative Religion</i>. p. 369 </p>\n\n<p>25 Sir James George Frazer, <i>The Golden Bough</i>, (New York, NY.: Macmillan Company,\n1940) p. 56 </p>\n\n<p>26 Geoffrey Parrinder, <i>Worship in the World's Religions</i>, p. 27 We would have to\nside with Parrinder here against Frazer. The argument referred to runs thus, \"But if\nin the most backward state of human society now known to us we find magic thus\nconspicuously present and religion conspicuously absent, may we not reasonably conjecture\nthat the civilized races of the world have also at some period of their history passed\nthrough a similar intellectual phase, that they attempted to force the great powers of\nnature to do their pleasure before they thought of courting their favor by offerings and\nprayer--in short that, just as on the material side of human culture there has everywhere\nbeen an Age of Stone, so on the intellectual side there has everywhere been an Age of\nMagic?\" Sir James George Frazer, <i>The Golden Bough</i>, (New York, NY.: Macmillan\nCompany, 1940) p.55 </p>\n\n<p>This argument, cited here in full because it is typical of the attitude of many\nscholars, is based on conjecture and misinformation. There is never an absence of religion\nin \"primitive\" societies, nor is there an absence of magic in the so-called\n\"civilized races of the world\", as this paper hopefully shows. </p>\n\n<p>27 Alfred C. Haddon, <i>Magic and Fetishism</i>, p. 79 This description fits most\npriestly mystical practices in well developed objectified religion. Haddon further states,\n\"...the conception of the fetish as the vehicle of communication between spirit and\nworshiper raises fetishism to a higher plane in religious evolution...\" p. 80 And\nagain, \"...(fetishism) includes conceptions which persist into higher forms of\nreligion, such as the worship of the symbol of an unseen power.\" p. 92 Here we see an\nexample of language that is somewhat outdated, although the content of the statement is\ntrue. </p>\n\n<p>28 Harold Turner, \"Holy Places, Sacred Calendars\", in <i>Eerdman's Handbook\nto World Religions</i>, (Grand Rapids, MI.: William Eerdman Publishing Company, 1982,)\nTurner is typical of many when he says, \"Since divine power is more accessible at\nsanctuaries, these become places of pilgrimage.\" Here is the \"vehicle\"\nnotion to be sure. However, he then feels it necessary to add, \"The synagogues,\nchurches and mosques of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, however, should be seen as\nmeeting-places for the worshipers, not as sacred dwelling-places for God.\" p.20 This\ndistinction seems unwarranted. Why is it necessary to remove one's shoes before entering a\nmosque? Why are children not permitted to run in the \"sanctuary\"? Why may we\nsmoke in the parking lot, but not in the sanctuary? What does the term Sanctuary mean? </p>\n\n<p>Carmody and Carmody have a more accurate view when they say, \"A mosque, a\nsynagogue, and a church all show likenesses of a Hindu or a Buddhist temple. All five\nenclose sacred space.\" Denise L. Carmody and John T. Carmody, <i>Ways To The Center\nSecond Edition</i>, p. 352 </p>\n\n<p>29 Edward Norbeck, <i>Religion in Primitive Society</i>, p. 82 </p>\n\n<p>30 This is the interpretation favored by Wallis for many objectified aspects of\nreligion. For instance \"...the simple ritual act of crossing oneself, in Catholic\ncustom, by touching the fingers to the forehead and chest in four, must be understood as a\nstatement of intent to secure divine power as a protection against danger, spiritual or\nphysical. The \"sign of the cross\", the extremities of which are indicated by the\npoints touched, invokes the whole story of Christ and its complex meanings; the\naccompanying litany--\"In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,\nAmen\"--...constitutes both a prayer and a primitive magical conception of power\ninherent in naming; Thus, this simple act may be a statement ...of beliefs based both on\nancient Christian mythology and even more ancient conceptions of magic.\" Anthony F.\nC. Wallis, \"Rituals: Sacred and Profane--An Anthropological Approach\", in <i>Ways\nof Being Religious Readings For a New Approach to Religion</i>, p. 156 </p>\n\n<p>31 Haddon, Alfred C. <i>Magic and Fetishism</i>, p.9432 Geoffrey Parrinder, <i>Worship\nin the World's Religions</i>, p. 28. He acknowledges that there are some temples among\nnon-literate peoples, but points out that they are small, and often not built of lasting\nmaterial. </p>\n\n<p>34 Edward Norbeck, <i>Religion in Primitive Society</i>, p. 56 </p>\n\n<p>35 Robert Brow, \"Origins of Religion\", in <i>Eerdman's Handbook to World\nReligions</i>, (Grand Rapids, MI.: William Eerdman Publishing Company, 1982,) p. 31 For a\ngood defense of this theory on the popular level, see Don Richardson, <i>Eternity in Their\nHearts</i>, (Ventura CA: Regal Books, 1981) </p>\n\n<p>36 Robert Brow, \"Origins of Religion\", in <i>Eerdman's Handbook to World\nReligions</i>, \"The essence of priestcraft is the rise of a group of people who claim\nto control access to God, and who suggest that the offering of sacrifice is a meritorious\nact which forces God to grant favors\". p. 38 Brow cites the case of India, \"The\nBrahmins were suggesting that by the right sacrifices, which they could alone offer, they\ncould procure the favors of the gods, various temporal blessings, and a good place in\nheaven. Gods, men, governments, all were under priestly control.\" p. 38 </p>\n\n<p>37 Robert Brow, \"Origins of Religion\", in <i>Eerdman's Handbook to World\nReligions</i>, (Grand Rapids, MI.: William Eerdman Publishing Company, 1982,) \"This\nshows how easily priestcraft degenerates into magic. Once sacrifice becomes a meritorious\nact which forces God to give blessings, it can be used to obtain benefits for oneself and\nharm for one's enemies. Obviously we are now only one stage removed from the medicine\nman...\" p. 38 </p>\n\n<p>38 Sir E.A. Wallis Budge, <i>Amulets and Talismans</i>, (University Books, 1961, New\nHyde Park, NY) p. xvi. </p>\n\n<p>39 Sir E.A. Wallis Budge, <i>Amulets and Talismans</i>, \"...from early Christian\ntimes the Cross has been regarded as the amulet and talisman par excellence throughout\nEthiopia.\"p.xxii, </p>\n\n<p>and again,\"...civilized priests of Egypt, Sumer and Babylonia... did not reject\nthe crude magical beliefs and practices of their predecessors...on the contrary they\nadopted many of them unaltered, and they formed an integral part of the mystery of the\nreligion which they formulated. Henceforth magic and religion went hand in hand. The gods\nbecame magicians, and employed magic when necessary, and dispensed it through their\npriests to mankind.\" p.xvi </p>\n\n<p>and finally, \"...in Babylonia, Assyria and Egypt amulets were designed and made by\nworkmen attached to the great temples, and the inscriptions on them were drafted by the\npriests and engraved by employees in the temples.\" p.xxiv </p>\n\n<p>40 Sir E.A. Wallis Budge, <i>Amulets and Talismans</i>, \"Shortly after the close\nof the IVth century of our Era, a sort of revival in the use of amulets began and the\nChristians began to make use of amulets...by the clergy and laity alike to drive away\ndevils and disease-producing spirits. (the cross)...Then came pictures of the Virgin Mary,\nand pictures and figures of the Archangels and the great saints, and the cult of the\nrelics of the martyrs... Untanned leather and parchment and papyrus and stones were also\ninscribed with extracts from the Scriptures, and finally, after the invention of paper, <i>Amulets\nand Talismans</i> of paper became common. And a species of Christian Magic came into\nbeing. The greatest name and word of power was Jesus, and the Host and sacramental oil and\nincense became, to many, amulets of invincible power, and the Sacred Elements were\nactually called \"immortal medicine\".\" p. xxviii </p>\n\n<p>41 Robert Brow, \"Origins of Religion\", in <i>Eerdman's Handbook to World\nReligions</i>, p. 38 and p. </p>\n\n<p>42 His chronology is open to debate in my view, although the major point is correct. </p>\n\n<p>42 Anthony F. C. Wallis, \"Rituals: Sacred and Profane--An Anthropological\nApproach\", in <i>Ways of Being Religious Readings For a New Approach to Religion</i>,\nWallis also applies these steps to \"secular\" ritual. </p>\n\n<p>43 Anthony F.

Wallis, \"Rituals: Sacred and Profane--An Anthropological\nApproach\", in <i>Ways of Being Religious Readings For a New Approach to Religion</i>,\np. 159 </p>\n\n<p>46 Wallis affirms that \"The ritual process, as described above, is a universal\nhuman phenomenon...\" and, \"One- but only one- way of institutionalizing the\nritual process is to interpret and apply it within the context of a belief in supernatural\nbeings.\" Anthony F. C. Wallis, \"Rituals: Sacred and Profane--An Anthropological\nApproach\", in <i>Ways of Being Religious Readings For a New Approach to Religion</i>,\np. 160 </p>\n\n<p>47 Paul did so frequently, but most clearly in I Cor. 3:16 (note plural\n\"humas\"), Christ did so in John 2:19-21, Peter in I Pet.2:5. </p>\n\n<p>48 Heb. 8:13; 13:10-14; Acts 7:48-50 etc. </p>\n\n<p>49 Col.2:16-17 directly declares the idea of a sacred calendar to be obsolete. Gal.\n4:9,10 says that a sacred calendar is among the \"weak and worthless elemental\nthings.\" Even though Paul allows \"weaker brethren\" to observe \"one day\ngreater than another\", it is clear that he views this outlook as unnecessary. (Rom.\n14) </p>\n\n<p>50 Hebrews chapters 5 through 8 decisively limits the intercession of the high Priestly\nrole to Christ, as does I Tim. 2:5. At the same time, Peter refers to all believers as\n\"a nation of priests\" in I Pet. 2:5, because we are able to intercede for\nothers. </p>\n\n<p>51 It could be argued that the anointing with oil mentioned in James 5:14 and the\nlaying on of hands practiced in Acts were elements of objectification also (Acts 13:3; I\nTim. 4:14; II Tim. 1:6; I Tim. 5:22). However, I think these were cultural features that\nwere not directly related to the worship of God-- that is, they deal with ways believers\nrelate to each other rather than to God. </p>\n\n<p>52 K.

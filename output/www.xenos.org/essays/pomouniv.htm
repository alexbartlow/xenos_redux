The same can be said of the Christian witness in today's\nsecular university. On the one hand, we see more openness to spirituality than in several\ndecades as naturalistic, materialistic dogma has fallen into disfavor in many quarters. On\nthe other hand, the <i>kind</i> of spirituality people are open to is decidedly\nanti-Christian. </p>\n\n<p>I am convinced that as the social and ideological landscape changes, the way Christians\napproach evangelism in the university is in need of change. All too often, we continue\ntaking the same approach that we did two or three decades ago--only to a new generation\nthat no longer accepts many of our key assumptions. Here's one measure of what I mean:\nTwenty years ago when I was an undergraduate philosophy major, Christianity was largely\nrejected because it was thought to be \"unscientific\" and consequently untrue.\nBut today Christianity is widely rejected, not because it was carefully examined and found\nwanting, but merely because it <i>claims</i> to be true. </p>\n\n<p>Effective campus ministry requires discerning the spirit of the age. Until recently,\nChristians enjoyed substantial common ground with most non-Christians. The majority of\nnon-Christians grew up with at least nominal church experience. When they took the time to\nthink about it, most people had a loosely Christian world view. So straightforward gospel\npresentations like Campus Crusade for Christ's <i>four spiritual laws</i> effectively put\nthese common notions into a meaningful and relevant framework. </p>\n\n<p>Today, we have far less common ground with secular culture. Contemporary students,\nchildren of the \"sixties generation\" that left the church in record numbers,\nhave grown up with minimal exposure to Christianity. In an age of religious pluralism, God\nis viewed more as an impersonal force than a transcendent Person. And biblical notions\nsuch as objective moral guilt don't fit into the dominant ethic of openness to everything.\n</p>\n\n<p>The kind of skeptics we now find on university campuses are not terribly moved by the\nevidence for Christianity. Rather, they find Christianity implausible and offensive\nbecause of its <i>content</i>. Christianity can't possibly be true, they think, because it\nexcludes other religious voices and traditions. Christianity may be subjectively true in\nthe sense that it \"works\" for those who believe, but imposing the gospel on\nothers violates today's carefully cultivated credulity toward all universal truth claims.</p>\n\n<p>What accounts for these changes? It's both ideological and sociological. And the two\nrelate to each other in an important way. Let's briefly consider some sociological factors\nthat shape contemporary thought, then examine more carefully the ideological dimension. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sociological factors</h3>\n\n<p>Historically, family and faith provided the foundation for personal identity, beliefs\nand values. These institutions produced a sense of permanence and stability. That God\nexists and that certain things are right or wrong were simply <i>given</i>. Church and\nfamily helped to establish and reinforce these convictions. </p>\n\n<p>Now both of these sources of identity and belief in trouble--and along with them, the\nsense of stability and permanence they once provided. Growing up without meaningful\nparticipation in a faith community of any kind, and often without a two parent family,\ntoday's student has very different lenses to see the world. Alan Bloom has suggested in\nhis <i>The Closing of the American Mind</i> that children of divorce are more likely to\nembrace a relativistic, fragmented outlook because, psychologically, that's been their\nexperience. When a child's most intimate trust has been violated by voluntary separation,\nnothing seems worthy of commitment, nothing is <i>given</i>.</p>\n\n<p>In the vacuum created by the absence of faith and family, education and media have\nemerged as the new shapers of contemporary thought. And these, sociologist Robert Bellah\nobserves, are the most secularized institutions in American society. The outlook\nencouraged by media and education mirrors and reinforces secular thought in the\nuniversity. Let's turn our attention to the ideological undercurrent of our day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Understanding the postmodern shift</h3>\n\n<p>We're witnessing a broad based backlash against reason in our culture. The argument is\nthat every time somebody claims to be in possession of <i>the</i> truth (especially\nreligious truth), it ends up repressing people. So it's more \"informed\" not to\nmake truth claims at all. How has this surprising outlook gained such wide acceptance\nespecially in the humanities and social sciences? That requires us to understand the\nemerging ideology of our day: Postmodernism.</p>\n\n<p>Postmodernism abandons <i>modernism</i>, the humanist philosophy of the European\nEnlightenment. Enlightenment thinking is based on French philosopher Rene Descartes'\nconcept of the autonomous man -- the one who starts from his own thought (\"I think,\ntherefore I am\") and builds his world view systematically from reason alone. Naively,\npostmodernists charge, modernists assumed that the mind is a \"mirror of nature,\"\nmeaning that our perceptions of reality actually correspond to the way the world is. From\nthis presumption, modernists built a culture that exalts technological achievement and\nmastery over nature. As postmodernists see it, expansion-minded capitalism and liberal\ndemocracy, outgrowths of modernist autonomous individualism, subjugated the earth to the\neurocentric, male dominated paradigm.</p>\n\n<p>But modernism planted the seeds of its own undoing. As modernists conquered the globe\nin the name of progress, oppressed and marginalized people have responded. \"Progress\ntoward what?,\" they cry. Postmodernists say that the idols of humanistic rationalism\nand technological proliferation have brought the modern age to the brink of disaster. The\nmyth of \"modern progress\" ends up in a nightmare of violence, both for the\npeople it marginalizes and for the earth. That's why today there is such interest in\nprimal cultures and for a world view that promotes the unity of humanity <i>with</i>\nnature, rather than man standing <i>over</i> nature. </p>\n\n<p>Postmodern critiques of humanism, progress and the efficacy of autonomous reason are\nwarranted. Grandiose claims of Enlightenment rationalists, who believed that human reason\nwas sufficient to arrive at ultimate truths independent of divine revelation, are\nunfounded. Blind optimism that technological advancement and essential human goodness will\nsolve all social problems is equally naive. </p>\n\n<p>While Christians should welcome much of postmodernism's critique of modernism, the <i>basis</i>\nof their critique rests on equally dubious assumptions and leads to disastrous\nconclusions. The rhetorical power of postmodern terms like \"tolerance,\"\n\"openness,\" and \"inclusion\" effectively disguise a more destructive\nobjective -- the end of all absolutes. Postmodern openness to spirituality may <i>seem</i>\nlike a positive step away from modernist naturalism. But the reality is that postmodern\nspirituality is inherently anti-Christian, because it considers the Christian message\n(like all world views) true only for those who accept it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Postmodern constructivism</h3>\n\n<p>Rather than seeing humanity as an ocean of individual rational selves, as modernists\nheld, postmodernists think of humans as products of culture and deny the individual self\nall together. Humans are considered \"social constructs.\" Postmodern psychologist\nand social critic Kenneth Gergen notes in his <i>The Saturated Self</i>, \n\n</p><dl>\n<lh>\n</lh>\n  <dd>With the spread of postmodern consciousness, we see the demise of personal definition,\n    reason, authority. . . All intrinsic properties of the human being, along with moral worth\n    and personal commitment, are lost from view. . . </dd>\n</dl>\n\n<p>The self stands under \"erasure\" for postmodernists, meaning that all\ntranscendent categories, including essential human personhood and human value are lost.\nThis raises not only important questions about human rights, but directly relates to the\nquestion of objective truth and reason. Postmodern anthropology is based on the idea that\nhumans are \"social constructs,\" or socially determined beings. Peter Berger's\nwork in the sociology of knowledge well expresses postmodern \"constructivism\"\nand its implications. In <i>Invitation to Sociology</i>, Berger states, \n\n</p><dl>\n<lh>\n</lh>\n  <dd>A thought of any kind is grounded in society. . .The individual, then, derives his\n    worldview socially in very much the same way that he derives his roles and his identity.\n    In other words, his emotions and his self-interpretation like his actions are predefined\n    for him by society, and so is his cognitive approach to the universe that surrounds him. </dd>\n</dl>\n\n<p>Rather than conceiving the mind as a mirror of nature, postmodernists argue that we\nperceive reality through the lens of culture and language. This leads postmodernists to\nreject the possibility of discovering objective truth since each culture approaches\nreality differently, depending on its particular needs and historical conditions. To claim\nknowledge of objective truth presumes the possibility of transcending the social\nconstruction of knowledge, which is, on postmodern assumptions, impossible.</p>\n\n<p>In the place of objective truth and what postmodernists call \"metanarratives\"\n(comprehensive world views), we find \"local narratives,\" or stories about\nreality that \"work\" for particular communities--but have no validity beyond that\ncommunity. Indeed, postmodernists reject the whole language of truth and reality in favor\nof literary terms like <i>narrative</i> and <i>story</i>. It's all about interpretation,\nnot about what's real or true.</p>\n\n<p>Postmodernists hold that the pretence of objective truth always does violence by\nexcluding other voices (regarding other world views to be invalid), and marginalizing the\nvulnerable by scripting them out of the story. Truth claims, we are told, are merely tools\nto legitimate power. Michel Foucault writes, \"We cannot exercise power except through\nthe production of truth.\" For postmodernists, truth claims reduce to mere propaganda,\nthe pernicious \"will to power.\" That's why in postmodern culture, the person to\nbe feared is the one who believes that we can actually discover ultimate truth. The <i>dogmatist</i>,\nthe <i>totalizer</i>, the <i>absolutist</i> is both naive and dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, rather than dominating others with our \"version of reality,\" we\nshould accept all beliefs as equally valid. Openness without the restraint of reason, and\ntolerance without moral appraisal are the new postmodern mandates. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Personal beliefs define truth</h3>\n\n<p>In postmodern culture, it's not possible to separate what a person believes from who\nthey are since the act of believing makes it true (for the person who believes).<b><i> </i></b>So\nrejecting the <i>content</i> of faith means rejecting the person holding it, because truth\nnow means <i>personal preference</i> and <i>personal empowerment</i>. It's no more\nappropriate to question the validity of a person's belief than to critique their choice\nfrom the dinner menu. Simply believing is justification enough. Striving together to\ndiscover truth through debate and spirited discussion is out, because no real difference\nexists between what a person chooses to believe and what's \"true for them.\" The\nreal concern is finding spirituality that \"fits.\"</p>\n\n<p>America is a religious smorgasbord. The only question seems to be \"what are you\nhungry for?\" And taste is more important than substance. That's why people are\nlargely unmoved when it is pointed out that their beliefs are often hopelessly\ncontradictory or that they live inconsistently with them. </p>\n\n<p>For most people, the postmodern outlook I've described is more \"absorbed\"\nthan thought out. An impressive majority of Americans believe that truth is relative. But\nfew know <i>why</i> they think that way. Still fewer have any clue about how their beliefs\npractically relate to their own lives. In general, people are more ideologically confused\nthan deeply committed to their convictions. So while we hear the rhetoric of openness to\neverything and tolerance for everyone, it's rare to find someone who really understands\nwhat this means. It's just the socially appropriate attitude to have.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, in an age of anti-dogmatism, radical subjectivity leads to the dangerously\narrogant inference that no one can ever be <i>wrong</i> about what they believe. If we are\nfree from the constraints of rationality, nothing separates truth from self-delusion.\nGergen's words are both candid and chilling: \n\n</p><dl>\n<lh>\n</lh>\n  <dd>. . . evaluation can only take place from within a perspective. To favor one of these\n    perspectives because it is 'objectively true' presupposes that I have a perspective in\n    which 'objectively true' is an intelligible criterion of evaluation. If in my view\n    'objective truth' is a misleading term, I can scarcely condemn a theory because it is\n    objectively false. </dd>\n</dl>\n\n<p>The age of anti-dogmatism ends up being the age of anti-intellectualism. Truth has been\nreplaced, especially among many academics, for politically empowering narrative. This kind\nof thinking is a the foundation of revisionist history, feminist critical method, and many\ncurrent formulations of multiculturalism.</p>\n\n<p>Christians need to be respectful of what others believe and of the traditions and\nexperiences that form those beliefs. But the postmodern demand to uncritically accept all\nbeliefs as true (at least for the person who believes them) is fanatical. Beliefs formed\nin the postmodern climate of openness and tolerance create a firewall against genuine and\nsubstantive dialogue about spiritual and moral truth. For example, \"Political\nCorrectness\" advocates like Stanley Fish have argued that since all speech is a\npolitical power-play, ideas must be monitored and managed, not rationally and\nconstructively engaged. This has given rise to the accusation, even among liberal\nacademics like Harvard's Alan Dershowitz, that a new McCarthyism pervades intellectual\nlife today. History offers sobering testimony to the high price such anti-rational\ndogmatism exacts.</p>\n\n<p>To reach today's university student with the gospel and to raise up a new generation of\nChristian servants, Christian leaders on campus must understand postmodernism in both\nideological and popular forms. Traditional apologetic approaches that stress historical\nand scientific evidence will be compelling only when confidence in the objectivity of\ntruth and reason have been restored--and this is the central apologetic task of our day.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/resource.htm\">\n\n<p>Return to the resources page</p>\n</a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/index.htm\">\n\n<p>Return to the Crossroads Project</p>\n</a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\">\n\n<p>Return to the Essays page</p>\n</a>\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:LeffelJ@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=postmodem\">Send Jim a\ncomment or question</a> </p>\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Understanding Today's Postmodern University","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/pomouniv.htm"}

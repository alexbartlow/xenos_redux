Provinces throughout Europe were designated either Lutheran, Calvinist, or\nRoman Catholic. Other groups (such as Anabaptists, Quakers, and Mennonites) were outlawed\neverywhere. H.

Tappert, trans. p. 43. </p>\n\n<p>25It is relatively easy to demonstrate that Spener's use of the word \"reason\"\nshould usually be taken in the sense of \"autonomous reason.\" This is evident\nfrom the fact that at the same time that he resists reading the Scriptures with the use of\nreason, he prescribes standard hermeneutical rules for the proper interpretation of\npassages. For example, \"Every person reading the Scriptures must first pay attention\nhow the verses fit together and then pay attention to each individual word. Various parts\nof the Scripture must be compared with one another. . .not too much typological or\nallegorical understanding. . . One must be particularly careful not to allow reason to\nrule where faith ought to.\" Philip Jacob Spener, \"On the Necessary and Useful\nReading of the Holy Scriptures,\" in Peter C. Erb, ed.

II p. 37. </p>\n\n<p>28He considers this bad enough to cause loss of salvation in the perpetrator. \"For\nGodly faith cannot exist without the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit cannot exist along\nside of premeditated and prevailing sins.\" Philip Jacob Spener, Pia Desideria, Allen\nC.

In\nPhilip Jacob Spener, \"The Spiritual Priesthood,\" in Peter C. Erb, ed. Pietists:\nSelected Writings, p. 62, we read, \"But are women not forbidden to teach? Yes, namely\nin the public congregation. But that it is permitted to them outside of the public\ncongregation is clear from the passages and apostolic examples cited (I Cor. 14:34; I Tim.\n2:11,12).\" This he could argue with more plausibility from the scriptures cited.\nHowever he makes no effort to harmonize I Cor. 14:34 with I Cor. 11:5 which must refer to\npublic prayer and prophecy in context. </p>\n\n<p>66Francke (Spener's disciple) even more strongly rejected the distinction between\nclergy and laity \"`What horrid Mischief this wicked distinction is the cause of.. .\n.'

The Council of\nTrent states plainly: `If any one saith that by the said Sacraments of the New Law grace\nis not conferred through the act performed (ex opere operato), but that faith alone in the\ndivine promise suffices for the obtaining of grace, let him be accursed.'

Valentine\nWeigel was a mystical author and Lutheran pastor who turned out to be a theosophist when\nhis private works were published posthumously. He was therefore completely discredited in\nthe minds of orthodox Lutherans, and his name was a synonym for mystical heresy. </p>\n\n<p>Quakers were likewise a symbol of religious extremism in Germany at this time. They\nwere widely believed to be guilty of \"enthusiasm\" which means that they thought\nGod was speaking directly to them. </p>\n\n<p>83Ernst Stoeffler, The Rise of Evangelical Pietism, p. 2. </p>\n\n<p>84So, Harnack cited in Allen C.

Of course, both of these possibilities could be\ntrue at once. Steven E. Ozment, Mysticism and Dissent, p. 12.

Deeter,\ntrans. Bk. II p. 93,94. Spener believed that he was following the lead of Luther in this\nposition. On the strong impact of the mystics on Luther's theology see Ernst Stoeffler,\nThe Rise of Evangelical Pietism, p. 191,192 However, stoeffler reminds us that Luther\n\"progressively grew away from mysticism. . . \" p. 192. </p>\n\n<p>94Philip Jacob Spener, \"On Hindrances to Theological Studies,\" in Peter C.\nErb, ed.

He also\npoints out that \"Ritschl scents a departure from Lutheranism in his [Arndt's]\nadoption of medieval mystical elements, but his contemporary opponents were more concerned\nwith traces of `enthusiasm.'\" p. 54. Interestingly, Arndt could with some\njustification be called a Weigelian because one of the chapters in his Vom wahren\nChristenthum (section 34 of Book II) was seen to be from Valentin Weigel, when the\nlatter's works were published in 1611. p. 54. </p>\n\n<p>104For example, see Hans Denck's comment that, `For one who is not in God's household,\nthe letter [i.e. Scripture] is of no use; one who is in his household knows how\ntrustworthy the Lord is without the letter.'

Deeter, An Historical and\nTheological Introduction p. 46. </p>\n\n<p>144With regard to ecclesiology, the anabaptist movement had many who argued in a\nsimilar vein. </p>\n\n<p>145Ensign is the author who argues this case most strongly. Yet he is not entirely\nconvincing. The elements he mentions as belonging to Boehmism include;<br>\n\"The Christian is to have no sect. . .\" (19) This could also have come from an\nidealistic reading of many passages in the Bible (Eph. 4:3ff). There are certainly many\nmodern theologians who have this view without reference to Boehme.<br>\n\"Predestination to damnation was a blasphemous idea,\" (20) but Spener and many\nothers (such as the Quakers) thought the same thing.<br>\n\"One must `put on Christ' and experience the `process' of the incarnation within\none's self,\" (20) but it is sometimes a fine line between this language and Pauline\nnotions of identification with Christ (II Cor. 4:7-18). The process idea is also typical\nof other German mystics. Lordship theology was typical of all pietists.<br>\n\"Sophia mysticism,\" Ensign admits is \"a variation on the typical medieval\nlove-phantasy theme, based on the Song of Solomon.\" (20,21) Indeed this theme was\nvery common in the medieval period, as well as after the reformation (see \"Other\nArndtians\" below). Besides, Ensign admits, \"some [radical pietists] abstained\nfrom either of these sentimental cults,\" (21).<br>\n\"Celibacy as a spiritually more desirable state than marriage,\" (21) but this\nwas hardly new with Boehme. One need never have heard of Boehme to have this view, which\nhad dominated the middle ages, and is clearly evident in the earliest monastic writers. <br>\n\"Religion should not be controlled in any way by the state,\" (21) but this was\nthe automatic cry of all those who were being persecuted by the state for Religion.<br>\nFinally, Ensign not only admits, \"Other origins may be found for many, if not most,\nof these ideas. . .Boehme himself was a part of the mystical-spiritualist tradition.\"\np. 21, but also \"They [the radical pietists] did not consider themselves Boehmists as\nsuch in most instances,\" and \"Writers presenting Boehme's ideas rarely\nacknowledged their dependence on him.\" p. 21. <br>\nOne must ask at this point whether sufficient value is left of the theory when it is so\nqualified that virtually nothing remains? Unless there is other material that was not\nproduced, this author remains unconvinced that Boehme is the main source of the radical's\ntheology. <br>\n</p>\n\n<p>This is not to say that he was not an influence at all. We know that Gichtel was a\nBoehmist. He said, \". . .I must acknowledge that [Boehme's] writings gave been to me\nof more service for the understanding of the Bible than all my University learning.\"\ncited in Rufus M. Jones, Spiritual Reformers in the 16th and 17th Centuries, p. 153. And\nwe can place Gichtel in direct influence of Gottfried Arnold, and probably Hochman.\nHowever, does this mean that Arnold's teachings are simply Boehmist? The fact must be\nreckoned with that virtually all of these ideas were rife in the intellectual climate of\nGermany at this time, leading this author to feel that Ensign is over-simplifying the\nissue.

Brown goes further, pointing out that in\nspite of their alleged agreement with the Lutheran definition of the church, Pietism\ntended to shift its stress from the visible to the invisible church.

The question remains as to\nwhether Pietism paved the way for a similar secular expression of these themes.\" p.\n858. This observation deserves consideration, but may be superficial. The points of\ncontact could be coincidental, and do not necessarily stem from the same basis.

And some\nChristian authors have defended the 'big bang' theory as more consistent with the biblical\ndoctrine of creation. </p>\n\n<p>Barbour submits that both theories are capable of either a naturalistic or theistic\ninterpretation. Both theories regress to an unexplained situation which is treated as a\n'given'; the 'primeval nucleus' in Gamow's oscillating universe theory and the 'continual\ncreation' of matter in Hoyle's steady state theory.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, at this time the standard 'big bang' model enjoys the widest acceptance\nof the scientific community. While this model can be interpreted as compatible with the\ntraditional doctrine of creation <i>ex nihilo</i></p> this is presently at best speculative.  \n\n<p>Themost constructive aspect of modern cosmology is that it attempts to scientifically\ndescribe the formation of the universe without religious recourse. The theories\nacknowledge their limited domain of describing mechanisms of formation of the universe and\nnot purposes external to the system observed. </p>\n\n<p>While the effort has not been flawless and many philosophical interpretations have been\nadded to the scientific statements (particularly in the popularized versions) the effort\nhas produced a cosmology essentially devoid of mythical content. The effort to produce a\nscientific cosmology has been conducted without any overt attempts at simultaneously\nproducing a natural theology. It is interesting to note that this more or less objective\neffort has produced (at least in the minds of those who hold a concordists view of the\nbible) a cosmology that points to the biblical creative origin of the universe.</p>\n\n<p>In an apologetic defense of the biblical creation narrative some caution must be used\nwhen attacking the weaknesses or embracing the merits of a particular scientific theory.\nThis applies to both theories of cosmology or evolution. </p>\n\n<p>The concordist's attempts to align the non-scientific biblical narrative of creation\nwith the current scientific cosmology can be perilous. This approach runs the risk of\nsetting-up an endless cycle of reconciliation of theological and philosophical aspects of\nChristianity with the mechanical details of each new theory or theoretical modification. </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps a more fruitful strategy would be to expose the philosophical parasites that\nattach themselves to scientific theories and masquerade as scientific conclusions. If we\nare going to critique technical details of a scientific theory then we should stand along\nside the scientist as a scientist and critique the mechanical details of a theory on\nscientific ground. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>APOLOGETIC SIGNIFICANCE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This discussion should provide basis for; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x95; identifying and resolving \"false\" conflicts or pseudo-problems due to\ncomplementary descriptions of events,</p>\n\n<p>&#x95; eliminating confusions between metaphysical inductions/deductions and physical\ninductions/deductions attributed to scientific interpretations of data,</p>\n\n<p>&#x95; defining a proper interaction between science and theology in which a mutual,\nalthough distinct, concern for the truth about the nature of reality suggests a\nrelationship more characteristic of allies than combatants.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>BIBLIOGRAPHY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Smith, Quentin (1992), <i>Faith and Philosophy</i>, Vol. 9, No.2, 217-237.</b> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Presents an argument for God's nonexistence using Big Bang cosmological theory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Craig, William Lane, (1992), <i>Faith and Philosophy</i>, Vol. 9, No.2, 238-248.</b></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Refutes the arguments given in the previous citation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Lindley, David (1993), <i>The End of Physics: The Myth of a Unified Theory</i>, </b></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Provides an historical overview of developments leading to Big Bang cosmology and\npoints out some of the presuppositional elements in the development of cosmological\ntheories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Schhroeder, Gerald (1990), <i>Genesis and the Big Bang: The Discovery of Harmony\nBetween Modern Science and the Bible</i>, Bantam Books.</b></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attempts to harmonize our current understanding of cosmology, quantum mechanics, and\ngeneral relativity with an essentially literal interpretation of Genesis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Ross, Hugh (1991), <i>The Fingerprint of God</i> (Second Edition), Promise\nPublishing Company.</b></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Presents a concordist view of modern cosmology and Genesis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Weinberg, Steven (1992), <i>Dreams of a Final Theory</i>, Pantheon Books.</b></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Justifies a reductionist view of cosmology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Hawking, Stephen (1988), <i>A Brief History of Time</i>, Bantom Books.</b></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discuses the implications of theories of cosmology that would render the existence of a\ncreator (God) as superficial because physics does not permit him to do any thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Peebles, P.

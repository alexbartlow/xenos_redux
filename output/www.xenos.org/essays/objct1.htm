It is also one of the most universal features of religion. As Norbeck\nobserves, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Great religions have indeed arisen as ethical or philosophical principles for the\n  guidance of man, but once they have become the province of multitudes...they have met a\n  common fate of objectification; that is, of being cast into concrete form so that they may\n  be actively appreciated by the eyes, ears, or other sense organs rather than remaining\n  only abstract ideas and beliefs.\"1 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And again, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Objectification in varying degree and form appears in all known religious\n  complexes of primitive peoples and it has been outstanding in the religions of civilized\n  societies.\"2 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The student of history of religion must wonder why this is such a universal tendency.\nAny phenomenon that appears everywhere on earth, during every period of history, and in\nevery known religious complex, must have some underlying explanations that are fairly\ncommon or general. </p>\n\n<p>The purpose of this study is to survey some of the current and past explanations put\nforward for objectification of religion, and to evaluate the credibility of these views in\nthe estimation of this author.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Methodology: Discovering Reasons for Objectivation</h3>\n\n<p>The first question that must be raised is whether generalized themes of the sort\nenvisaged in this paper are really valid, or whether we are simply imposing an artificial\nframework onto the field of comparative religion. Parrinder complains that, \"A good\ndeal of tinkering has been done at the theory of religion, without coming to grips with\nthe facts of religious experience.\"3 </p>\n\n<p>This complaint is no doubt appropriate, especially when one considers the very great\nnumber of blunders that unbridled speculation has produced.4 He also explains another\nproblem,(the religious) \"...state is externalized in rites which we can observe, but\ntheir meaning depends finally on an awareness of God and that men are dependent on him and\nmust be resigned to his will. At this point the theologian takes over from the\nanthropologist.\"5 </p>\n\n<p>Authorities today increasingly agree that a deeper understanding is required of the\ncultures, economies, languages, and histories of each religious group before trying to\ncompare them, and reach generalized conclusions, if, indeed, we can then reach such\nconclusions. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, we must agree with Norbeck when he observes that, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"...very few comparative studies of primitive religion of any sizable compass have\n  been attempted in America during the past two decades; and none has been attempted in\n  England, where a common view seems to be that we must understand every detail of the\n  social and cultural context of each religion from the native viewpoint before any kind of\n  comparison is attempted... something which seems hardly attainable...\"6 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Norbeck recognizes that if we insist on taking every religious system as a separate\nentity even to the extent that it cannot be compared to others (because the social context\nis different) we wind up in a shoreless ocean of unintelligible detail. Unless it is\npossible to draw some general conclusions, there would seem to be no basis for a study of\ncomparative religion at all! Carmody and Carmody agree with this when they say, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"...we believe that the empiricism that misses such unity (between religious\n  concepts) and mystery is at least an unwitting reductionism-- an insistence that humanity\n  is no more than as it behaves. Usually, that insistence indicates an impoverished\n  imagination...\"7 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Certainly, if we take care to qualify any conclusions reached, and to ascertain that\nthey are truly representative, it is legitimate to seek for more or less universal themes\nunderlying universal practices. This is especially true when we see some practices that\nare far too widespread and similar to be coincidental. Whether we look into the nature of\nman, or into the nature of man's environment, (or both), there must be some connecting\nfactors that explain these patterns of similarity. </p>\n\n<p>As stated earlier, one pattern that is extremely similar throughout the world and\nthroughout history, is objectification of religion. Since the subject of objectification\nof religion is too broad to treat completely in a paper such as this, we will be majoring\non the aspect of objectification known as <i><b>sacred space</b></i>.8 We hope the notion\nof sacred space will shed light on the process of objectification as a whole. </p>\n\n<p>Sacred space refers to the universal tendency of religious man to identify space that\nis <i>sacred</i>, and to carefully delimit that space from <i>profane </i>space. This\nspace, once marked off, usually also plays a key role in the ongoing worship and religious\npractice of the faithful in that system. </p>\n\n<p>Delineation of sacred space is expressed in a tremendous variety of ways in different\nreligious systems, but is always recognizable as the same basic practice, even when the\ntype, size, or purpose of the space differs. This is why the notion of sacred space, which\nis a key component in objectification of all religions, is a good departure point for a\nstudy of this type. \n\n</p><ul>\n  <li>It is universal </li>\n  <li>It is crucial to the process of objectification, and </li>\n  <li>There is no obvious external reason for it </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Perhaps by discovering the reasons for delineating sacred space, we can identify themes\ninvolved in the larger questions of objectification of religion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=objectification\">Ask\nDennis a question or share a comment.</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/objct_a.htm\">Go to the Objectification table of contents</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\">Go to the Essays page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/objct2.htm\">Read on to the next section in \"Objectification\"</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Go to the Xenos home page</a> </p>\n\n<p>Send Dennis a comment of question</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Objectification Of Religion: Universal Themes I","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/objct1.htm"}

The defining scene of the movie is\nan exchange between a zealous, if naive young missionary and a cynical, displaced Native\nAmazonian. The latter confronts the missionary, saying, \"If the Lord made Indians the\nway they are, who are you people to make them different?\"</p>\n\n<p>You don't have to go to the Brazilian jungle to get this message. It is also the ethic\nat most secular universities. Attempting to convert someone is considered intolerant and\narrogant, because it implies standing in judgment over their unique experience and\nculture. Christianity is not a live option for a growing majority of the emerging\ngeneration, but for reasons that are rather unique to our day. It's not that Christianity\nhas been refuted by scientific fact or historical scrutiny. Rather, it's considered\nimplausible because it claims to be universally and objectively true--that is, true for\neverybody. Put simply, the Christian message violates today's carefully cultivated\nincredulity toward all absolutes, especially religious ones.</p>\n\n<p>Christian <i>exclusivism</i>, the position that Christianity is the final word on\nmatters of ultimate truth, is not \"politically correct.\" Sometimes professing\nfaith in Christ in higher education is tantamount to admitting that you're a racist or\nsexist. Most of the time though it's met with the mantra-like refrain, \"I'm glad\nyou've found something that works for you, but don't impose your beliefs on me.\"</p>\n\n<p>I suggest that the primary barrier to getting a hearing for the gospel on the vast\nmajority of campuses today is ideologically driven <i>pluralism</i>. Pluralism takes the\nfact of the world's rich cultural diversity and makes an \"ism\" out of it. It\ndoesn't merely extol the virtue of understanding and appreciating cultural differences;\nvirtually everyone is for that. Pluralism holds that distinct cultural beliefs are true\nfor that culture--but not for cultures that operate out of a different\n\"paradigm.\" Pluralists say that truth is a \"social construction.\" It\nis <i>created</i> through social consensus and tradition, not discovered in reality that\nexists independently of our beliefs. Truth is subjective interpretation, not\ncorrespondence between our beliefs and reality.</p>\n\n<p>Since pluralists consider truth to be a cultural construct, it is the height of\narrogance to try to convert someone from their paradigm (especially if it's non-western)\nto Christianity. That's what most people mean when they say that Christianity is\nintolerant. But should we accept the pluralistic definition of \"tolerance\"?</p>\n\n<p>Social intolerance used to mean attacking someone or discriminating against them\nbecause of who they are or what they believe. Biblically minded Christians should oppose\nthis form of intolerance because it is bigotry and prejudice. We must also accept the fact\nthat Christians have acted intolerantly in this sense. Indeed, the name of Christ has been\nattached to some of history's greatest outrages. While Christians have often been at the\nforefront of social reform, we must come to terms with a legacy of hypocrisy in areas like\nslavery, savagery toward Native Americans and other human rights abuses.</p>\n\n<p>Having made these observations, it must be emphasized that such hypocrisy is\nunbiblical. That is, while Christians have treated vulnerable peoples unjustly, biblical\nChristianity itself is not intolerant. The Bible gives us a genuine basis to recognize\nhypocrisy and confront it for what it is. Because the Bible upholds the dignity of all\npersons as image-bearers of God, we have a basis for a genuinely diverse culture. When\nfaithful to the scripture, Christianity is tolerant in the appropriate sense of the term.</p>\n\n<p>But as many define tolerance today, Christianity <i>is</i> intolerant. When tolerance\nmeans that we are to accept all beliefs as equally true and valid, Christians must\nrespectfully object. The notion that truth is a social construct is both unbiblical and\ndangerous. Truth matters. It's no mere philosophical abstraction. Jesus said, \"You\nshall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.\" Our commission is to spread\nthe good news to all the peoples of the earth. To make effective inroads in today's\nmulti-ethnic, culturally diverse university, we must do the hard work of engaging the\nthinking behind pluralism and the demands of this new meaning of tolerance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Understanding postmodern pluralism </h3>\n\n<p>The pluralistic view of tolerance is rooted in a broader intellectual and cultural\nmovement called <i>postmodernism</i>. For postmodern thinkers, who now dominate the arts,\nhumanities and social sciences of many universities, everything is a social construct. All\nclaims to truth are rooted in cultural bias, so there is no objective truth. Ethical\nvalues are the product of unique cultural traditions, so there are no moral absolutes.\nHuman personhood is the product of socialization, so there is no universal human essence.</p>\n\n<p>These assumptions have enormous implications. Postmodern psychologist and social critic\nKenneth Gergen notes in his book <i>The Saturated Self</i>, \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li>With the spread of postmodern consciousness, we see the demise of personal definition,\n    reason, authority. . . All intrinsic properties of the human being, along with moral worth\n    and personal commitment, are lost from view. . .<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pluralsm.htm#Endnote1\">[endnote\n    1]</a><a name=\"end1\"> </a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The self stands under \"erasure\" for postmodern pluralists, meaning the denial\nof all transcendent categories, including human personhood. This raises not only important\nquestions about human rights, but directly relates to the question of objective truth and\nreason. Though not a postmodernist, Peter Berger's work in the sociology of knowledge\nprovides the basis for postmodern \"constructivism\" and its implications. Berger\nwrites, \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li>A thought of any kind is grounded in society. . .The individual, then, derives his\n    worldview socially in very much the same way that he derives his roles and his identity.\n    In other words, his emotions and his self-interpretation like his actions are predefined\n    for him by society, and so is his cognitive approach to the universe that surrounds him.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pluralsm.htm#Endnote2\">[endnote 2]</a><a name=\"end2\"> </a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Berger's observation, true in part, is driven to a radical conclusion by\npostmodernists. They reject the possibility of discovering objective truth all together,\nsince each culture approaches reality differently, depending on its particular needs and\nhistorical conditions. To claim knowledge of objective truth presumes the possibility of\ntranscending the social construction of knowledge, which is, on postmodern pluralistic\nassumptions, impossible.</p>\n\n<p>In the place of objective truth and what postmodernists call \"metanarratives\"\n(comprehensive world views), we find \"local narratives,\" or stories about\nreality that \"work\" for particular communities--but have no validity beyond that\ncommunity. Indeed, postmodernists reject the whole language of truth and reality in favor\nof literary terms like <i>narrative</i> and <i>story</i>. It's all about interpretation,\nnot about what's real or true.</p>\n\n<p>Postmodern pluralists hold that the pretense of objective truth always does violence by\nexcluding other voices (regarding other world views to be invalid), and marginalizing the\nvulnerable by scripting them out of the story. Truth claims, we are told, are merely tools\nto legitimate power. Michel Foucault writes, \"We cannot exercise power except through\nthe production of truth.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pluralsm.htm#Endnote3\">[endnote 3]</a><a name=\"end3\"> </a>For postmodernists, truth claims reduce to mere propaganda, the\npernicious \"will to power.\" That's why with postmodern pluralism, the person to\nbe feared is the one who believes that we can actually discover ultimate truth. The <i>dogmatist</i>,\nthe <i>totalizer</i>, the <i>absolutist</i> is both naive and dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, rather than dominating others with our \"version of reality,\" we\nshould accept all beliefs as equally valid. Openness without the restraint of reason, and\ntolerance without moral appraisal are the new pluralistic mandates. That's what makes\nevangelism so unfashionable on campuses today.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, in an age of anti-dogmatism, postmodern radical subjectivity leads to the\ndangerous inference that no one can ever be <i>wrong</i> about what they believe. If we\nare free from the constraints of rationality, nothing separates truth from self-delusion.\nGergen's words are both candid and chilling: \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li>. . . evaluation can only take place from within a perspective. To favor one of these\n    perspectives because it is 'objectively true' presupposes that I have a perspective in\n    which 'objectively true' is an intelligible criterion of evaluation. If in my view\n    'objective truth' is a misleading term, I can scarcely condemn a theory because it is\n    objectively false.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pluralsm.htm#Endnote4\">[endnote 4]</a><a name=\"end4\"> </a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Postmodern anti-dogmatism ends up being anti-intellectual. If we can't reject a theory\nbecause it is objectively false, then the pursuit of truth is meaningless. This explains\nwhy truth has been replaced, especially among many academics, for politically empowering\nnarrative. This kind of thinking is often found in revisionist history, feminist critical\nmethod, and many pluralistic formulations of multiculturalism.</p>\n\n<p>Christians need to be respectful of what others believe and of the traditions and\nexperiences that form those beliefs. Scripture upholds the value of cultural diversity by\ntells us to \"respect what is right in the sight of all people\" (Romans 14) and\n\"be all things to all people\" (1 Corinthians 9). But the postmodern demand to\nuncritically accept all beliefs as true (at least for the person who believes them) is\nfanatical. </p>\n\n<p>Beliefs formed in the pluralistic climate of openness and tolerance create a firewall\nagainst genuine and substantive dialogue about spiritual truth and human rights. For\nexample, \"political correctness\" advocates like Stanley Fish have argued that\nsince all speech is a political power-play, ideas must be monitored and managed, not\nrationally and constructively engaged.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pluralsm.htm#Endnote5\">[endnote 5]</a><a name=\"end5\"> </a>This has given rise to the accusation, even among liberal academics like\nHarvard's Alan Dershowitz, that a new McCarthyism pervades intellectual life today.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pluralsm.htm#Endnote6\">[endnote 6]</a> <a name=\"end6\"></a> History offers sobering\ntestimony to the high price such anti-rational dogmatism exacts. </p>\n\n<p>Contrary to the inviting rhetoric of openness and inclusion, postmodern pluralism\nthreatens those who are marginalized the most. If truth is really a political power-play,\nthe dominant culture is probably going to be the winner. And if human nature is a mere\ncultural construct, the rights of those who don't fit the arbitrary \"norm\" are\nat risk. As our culture continues down the path of fragmentation and alienation,\nChristians who make an informed and compelling case for the gospel and intrinsic human\ndignity have a powerful message for a pluralistic age. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The pluralist objection to Christian exclusivism</h3>\n\n<p>Dispite the clear and intractable problems with postmodern pluralism, it remains a\npowerful force both in academics and in popular culture. But nowhere is this more evident\nthan in religion. Religious pluralism is an emerging, measurable consensus of our\npostmodern age.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pluralsm.htm#Endnote7\">[endnote 7]</a><a name=\"end7\"></a> Oddly\nenough, some of the most ardent defenders of religious pluralism and virulent critics of\nChristian exclusivism are theologians and philosophers who profess faith in Christ.\nDistinguished philosopher of religion John Hick concludes, \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li>I believe that anyone who is either born or \"born again\" into the\n    conservative-evangelical thought world, and who has a questioning mind, will find that he\n    has to face challenges to the belief system within which his Christian faith was first\n    made available to him, and that he will almost certainly be led by rational or moral\n    considerations to modify or discard many of its elements.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pluralsm.htm#Endnote8\">[endnote\n    8]</a><a name=\"end8\"></a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So what are the \"rational and moral considerations\" for giving up\nexclusivism?<i> </i>Reflecting on the diversity of the world's religions, Hick says, \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li>[I]n the light of our accumulated knowledge of the other great world faiths [Christian\n    exclusivism] has become unacceptable to all except a minority of dogmatic diehards. For it\n    conflicts with our concept of God, which we have received from Jesus, as the loving\n    heavenly Father of all mankind; could such a Being have restricted the possibility of\n    salvation to those who happen to have been born in certain countries in certain periods of\n    history?<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pluralsm.htm#Endnote9\">[endnote 9]</a><a name=\"end9\"></a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Hick rightly points out that religious intolerance is usually born out of ignorance.\nOnce we become aware of the rich traditions that form the world's religions, it is much\nmore complicated to maintain the exclusivist view. But for Hick, Christian exclusivism is\nuntenable because it violates the moral character of God. He wonders how an all loving God\ncould condemn the vast majority to eternal hell simply because they happen to have been\nborn in the wrong place or at the wrong time? And isn't it arrogant to think that sincere\nand well intentioned people will be damned just because they happen to have encountered\nand accepted a different religion? Hick thinks that only the salvation of all humanity\nthrough various religious traditions is morally acceptable and rationally compelling. This\nfacet of pluralism is called <i>universalism.</i></p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Hick and other pluralists don't accurately represent Christian\nexclusivism. The Bible doesn't teach that God's judgment is based on where or when a\nperson is born. Also, religious sincerity is certainly no measure of truth. Yet Hick\nraises a troubling point. I really can't think of anything that bothers me more than the\ndoctrine of judgment. I don't like thinking about the possibility that people I love and\nrespect might be eternally separated from God. I'm troubled by Jesus' observation that\n\"narrow is the path that leads to salvation.\" Christians will make few inroads\ninto our pluralistic culture without providing a sensitive and coherent response to this\nrhetorically powerful and emotionally charged objection. To that end, I encourage you to\nread the excellent texts on this subject listed in the endnotes.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pluralsm.htm#Endnote10\">[endnote 10]</a><a name=\"end10\"></a> </p>\n\n<p>For the purposes of this essay, I'd like to make a couple of observations about Hick's\nalternative to Christian exclusivism. Does pluralistic universalism avoid the moral and\nrational problems Hick and others see in Christian exclusivism?</p>\n\n<p>Hick supposes that if God is truly loving, he will be revealed in all the great\nreligious traditions of the world. But let's note that accepting religious pluralism does\nnot entail universalism. On the contrary, all of the monotheistic religions Hick believes\nto be valid teach divine judgment. And the eastern religions--Hinduism and Buddhism in\nparticular--certainly don't teach universal salvation or <i>moksha</i> (release from the\ncycle of life). So simply asserting that all religions are legitimate paths to God, as\npluralists do, doesn't result in universal salvation. Indeed, it seems that if\nuniversalism is true, then it really doesn't matter what a person believes or what they do\nwith their life. Universalism actually has nothing to do with the pluralistic view of\nreligion. Consequently, pluralism does not overcome Hick's moral objection to Christian\nexclusivism.</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, universalism trivializes the meaning of divine love. This is so\nbecause if there is no ultimate accountability for our lives, no judgment, then the\nchoices we make in life are of no final consequence. Without judgment, there is no way to\ndistinguish between heaven and hell. After all, how would you characterize eternity with\nan unrepentant Hitler? In what sense could this be heaven? Further, how would six million\nJews think about the love of God if it didn't make any ultimate difference to him what\nHitler and the Nazis did? Universalism does not uniquely allow for the love of God as\npluralists suppose. It makes God indifferent to cruelty and trivializes the significance\nof human freedom by dislodging choices from their consequences. Any meaningful definition\nof God's love must also affirm his justice. Once we grasp the necessity of justice in\ndivine love, the uniqueness of the Christian message strikes a powerful chord. By God's\ngrace, he has poured out his judgment on Christ so that we who deserve judgment may\nreceive eternal life.</p>\n\n<p>The moral objection to Christian exclusivism based on God's judgment is simply not\ncompelling. But what about the religious pluralists' claim that it's arrogant and naive to\nsay that Christianity alone is true? Is pluralism a more reasonable position as Hick\npurports?</p>\n\n<p>Hick follows several lines of argument in support of religious pluralism. Here we\nconsider the two that most influence popular pluralistic views.</p>\n\n<p>First, Hick says that the universe is \"religiously neutral.\" By this he means\nthat none of the arguments for any particular world view are uniquely compelling. Even\ntrying to say which arguments are the most plausible is out, since knowledge of the\nuniverse is so limited. A range of alternatives that include atheism and all the great\nworld religions must be kept open. \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li>It seems, then, that the universe maintains its inscrutable ambiguity. In some aspects\n    it invites whilst in other it repels a religious response. It permits both a religious and\n    a naturalistic faith, but haunted in each case by a contrary possibility that can never be\n    exorcised. Any realistic analysis of religious belief and experience, and any realistic\n    defense of the rationality of religious conviction, must therefore start from this\n    situation of <i>systematic ambiguity.</i><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pluralsm.htm#Endnote11\">[endnote 11]</a><a name=\"end11\"></a> </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>To the extent that it is possible to be objective, the universe fails to come to the\naid of any particular world view. That's what Hick means by <i>systematic ambiguity</i>. </p>\n\n<p>On the one hand, Hick's position makes good sense. When theology is naively wed to\nprevailing scientific theories, it can lead to the corruption of both religion and\nscience. This is the lesson of the medieval marriage of Ptolemaic astronomy and Catholic\ndoctrine. Theology suppressed the growth of scientific inquiry, and the Copernican\nrevolution created the unnecessary conflict between science and religion. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, to say that the data of science and history is of no value in\ndiscerning religious truth goes too far. That the universe is finite, for example, is a\nwell established fact. This is consistent with the Bible, but inconsistent with eastern\nreligious teaching and suggests that the world is not, in Hick's words, \"religiously\nneutral.\" The data of science lends plausibility to some religious doctrines, while\nfalsifying others. Similarly, were factual statements made in the Bible shown to be\nhistorically false, this would count as positive evidence against Christianity. Clearly,\nscience and history have implications for religious truth claims. Religious propositions\nare subject to falsification just as any other truth claim.</p>\n\n<p>Second, pluralists think of religious truth as human experience within a cultural\nparadigm. Hick isn't interested in the data of science or history, since they maintain\ntheir \"inscrutable ambiguity\" on matters of ultimate reality. He adopts an\nessentially constructivist view of truth. Following the philosopher Immanuel Kant, Hick\nsays that we must distinguish between reality <i>as it is</i> (noumena) and reality <i>as\nwe perceive it</i> (phenomena). The idea is that we don't have direct access to reality as\nit is in itself. We think through \"interpretative filters\" that shape our\nperceptions of reality. For example, we see colors and hear sounds because that's the way\nour perceptual organs are set up to interpret light and sound waves. We have no way of\nknowing what, if any, color the world actually is since we can't escape perceiving the\nworld the way we do. Reality as it is <i>in itself</i> is beyond our grasp. We can be sure\nof our <i>ideas</i> of reality, but not of their correspondence to the world as it\nactually is. Philosophers have called this the <i>egocentric dilemma</i>.</p>\n\n<p>Hick applies this noumena/phenomena distinction to religion. Since human perception,\ngoverned by cultural conditioning, shapes our religious beliefs, Hick concludes that God,\nor the <i>Real</i> in itself, is beyond all human concepts.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pluralsm.htm#Endnote12\">[endnote 12]</a><a name=\"end12\"></a> Some religions conceive\nGod as personal, others as impersonal. Some view God as transcendent, others as imminent.\nBut once we recognize the basic distinction between reality as perceived and reality in\nitself, all of these differences based in human perception loose their significance. Hick\nstates, \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li>The distinction between the Real as it is in itself and as it is thought and experienced\n    through our human religious concepts entails. . .that we cannot apply to the Real in\n    itself the characteristics encountered in its [religious representations]. Thus it cannot\n    be said to be one or many, person or thing, conscious or unconscious, purposive or\n    non-purposive, substance or process, good or evil, loving or hating. None of the\n    descriptive terms that apply within the realm of human experience can apply literally to\n    the unexperiencable reality that underlies that realm.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pluralsm.htm#Endnote13\">[endnote\n    13]</a><a name=\"end13\"></a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>On this view, no religion truly reflects the Real in itself. That's what is thought to\nfollow from the noumena/phenomena distinction. Yet, Hick makes it clear that the major\nworld religions are valid within their cultural context. \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li>[Yahweh] is, according to my hypothesis, the divine persona in relation to the Jewish\n    people. And as such he represents a genuine, authentic, valid human perception of the\n    Eternal One from within a particular human culture and strand of history. But he is a\n    different divine persona from, say, Shiva or from Krishna, who are divine personae in\n    relation respectively to the Shaivite and the Vaishnavite communities of India.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pluralsm.htm#Endnote14\">[endnote 14]</a><a name=\"end14\"></a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Notice the dilemma in Hick's proposal. He wants to say that all major religions are\n\"genuine, authentic, valid human perceptions,\" and at the same time, \"[the\nReal] cannot be said to be one or many, conscious or unconscious, purposive or\nnon-purposive, substance or process, good or evil, loving or hating.\" In other words,\nit's valid for Christians to believe that God is \"good, purposive and\nconscious,\" yet those beliefs aren't actually true about God as he actually exists.\nOur experience of God is somehow valid even though it doesn't correspond to the the way\nGod is.</p>\n\n<p>This creates a strange tension within the pluralists' position. Either the major world\nreligions are authentic, valid manifestations of the Real, or they are not. If they are\nvalid, then the Real must be both personal and impersonal, purposive and non-purposive and\nso on. But this impossible, for it can not be the case that the Real possesses a\ncontradictory nature. It violates the <i>law of identity</i>. In affirming two mutually\nexclusive things about God, the pluralistic view ends up being rationally incoherent. God\ncould be personal <i>or</i> impersonal, but not <i>both</i> personal and impersonal. But\nif God is either personal or impersonal, then the pluralistic hypothesis fails because\nvarious religions disagree on this very important point.</p>\n\n<p>In reality, Hick is not committed to the pluralistic hypothesis that each religion is\ntrue in its own way. He is actually advocating agnosticism--the idea that no one can know\nGod or say anything true about him (her or it). Indeed, Hick seems to be disguising a\nrather well-trod agnosticism in the inviting rhetoric of religious pluralism.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Coming to terms with pluralistic tolerance</h3>\n\n<p>What does this analysis of pluralism mean for the Christian witness to secular culture?\nHere are a few principles to apply.</p>\n\n<p>First, Most people's thoughts about the world's religions are shaped more by their\ncultural and political legacy than the propositional or doctrinal content. With this in\nmind, Christians should not try to defend the indefensible. The only association many\nprimal cultures have with Christianity has been when it has been used as a tool of\nexploitation and domination. Even when that has not been the personal experience of\nnon-Christians on campus, it's usually the main thing they are taught about Christianity.\nWestern imperialism and Christianity, they learn, go hand in hand. We should lament and\ndecry this legacy of injustice just as loudly as anyone else. But just as emphatically, we\nshould demonstrate that the cynical use of religion to justify economic and political\nambition is anti-Christian. We need to distinguish between what the Christian message is\nand how it has been abused. There are also important examples of the biblical foundation\nfor many important civil rights movements such as the abolition of slavery and child\nlabor.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the rise of pluralism requires us to be more sensitive to the role culture\nplays in personal identity and forming spiritual beliefs. Becoming a Christian is not the\nsame thing as living and thinking like the conservative white middle class. Yet, that's\nthe image most non-Christians have in their minds-- which is why Christ is not a live\noption for many of them. </p>\n\n<p>We must be careful to minimize the intrusion of non-essential cultural baggage into our\nChristian witness. That means looking for opportunities to meet people in places where\nthey are comfortable even if we aren't. Subverting the expectations non-Christians have of\nChristians is an increasingly important part of being effective ambassadors for Christ\ntoday. We must be willing to move as far toward the culture as we need to, so long as it\ndoes not involve compromising biblical morality or truth. In short, it means adopting\nprinciples of cross-cultural missions in domestic evangelism. </p>\n\n<p>Third, we must be aware of the fact that the vast majority of people have\n  been well indoctrinated into the pluralistic tolerance ethic. To \"give\n  an account of the hope that is within us\" as scripture commands, we should\n  be familiar with pluralistic arguments like the ones considered in this paper.\n  By carefully and sensitively stripping away the attractive veneer of postmodern\n  pluralism, exposing it for what it is, we can eliminate a key barrier to communicating\n  the gospel. One thing stands out in my mind\n  more than anything else as I reflect on the Christian witness in our day: we\n  must be far more sophisticated in our thinking and flexible in our methods\n  than perhaps ever before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a name=\"Endnote1\">1. </a>Kenneth Gergen, The Saturated Self (New York: Basic Books,\n1991), 228,9. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/pluralsm.htm#end1\">Back to text</a></p>\n\n<p><a name=\"Endnote2\">2. </a>Peter Berger, Invitation to Sociology (Garden City, NJ:\nDoubleday &amp; Co., Inc., 1963), 117.</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"Endnote3\">3. </a>Micheal Foucault, Power/Knowledge (New York: Pantheon Books,\n1980), 132.</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"Endnote4\">4. </a>Gergen, <i>The Saturated Self</i>, 229.</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"Endnote5\">5. </a>See Stanley Fish, \"There's No Such Thing As Free Speech,\nAnd It's A Good Thing, Too<i>!,\" Boston Review</i>, (February, 1992), 3.</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"Endnote6\">6. </a>Alan Dershowitz, \"Harvard Witch Hunt Burns the Incorrect\nat the Stake,\" <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, Washington edition (22 April 1992), A11.</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"Endnote7\">7. </a>George Barna's research has found, for example that,\n\"about four out of every ten adults strongly concurred that when Christians, Jews,\nBuddhists, and others pray to gheir god, all of those individuals are actually praying to\nthe same god, but simply use different names for that deity.

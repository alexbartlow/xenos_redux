The\ncourse did not make me change my approach to Christian ethics. However, it did help me to\nmore clearly understand the basic components of Christian ethics. </p>\n\n<p>The purpose of this paper is to describe the basic components of this\n\"principles\" approach, to explain its hermeneutical approach, to contrast this\nethical approach to the contextualist and the theonomist approaches, and to apply this\napproach to the some of the issues which were discussed in class.</p>\n\n<h3>The Basic Components of the Approach</h3>\n\n<p>Using Chismar's schematic, the following terms need definition. </p>\n\n<p><i>Boundary Conditions</i> refer to those moral principles which are timeless and\ntherefore do not require cultural adaptation. Boundary conditions would be similar to what\nother \"principles\" ethicists call rules. Boundary conditions include both issues\nof hierarchical importance and moral dictums. Hierarchical issues would include the\npriority of people over things, and the priority of seeking God's approval rather than\nman's. Moral dictums would include the sanctity of human life (to be safeguarded wherever\npossible), sexuality to be expressed within the context of heterosexual marriage, the\nbenevolent rulership of man over nature, and basic respect for other people's property and\nwell-being in all social activity. </p>\n\n<p>It has been noted that most, if not all of these boundary conditions can be found to\ncorrespond in what is called \"natural law\". \"Natural law\" refers to\nthose things which men know instinctively about how they should live<a name=\"Footnote1A\">Footnote1</a>.\nThe Bible does seem to teach that there are moral norms which people know instinctively\n(cf Rom. 1:26,27,28,32; 2:14,15). A study of the basic ethics of world religions and\nphilosophers throughout history has revealed a remarkable agreement<a name=\"Footnote2A\">Footnote2</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p><i>Values</i> refers to that state of affairs on earth which God wants to bring about.\nObviously, one would be more solely dependent upon the Bible to discover values. It should\nbe noted that these values do not inherently contradict one another, but it is often not\npossible to have all of these values at the same time, so that some sort of prioritization\nmust be found to determine which are most strategically desirable in a given period of\nhistory. Such values would include man's reconciliation with God, peace on earth between\npeople, the treatment of all human beings with love and the meeting of their basic needs,\nunity within the Body of Christ, and the development of individual God-given abilities to\nglorify Him and serve man. </p>\n\n<p><i>Moral character development</i> refers to virtue, or the sanctification of the\nindividual Christian by the Holy Spirit so that he/she comes to manifest the values,\ngoals, attitudes and motivation of Jesus Himself. This definition of moral character\ndevelopment is, like the above values, dependent upon scripture for its definition, and\nsupremely on Jesus for its example. Such character would include above all\nself-sacrificing love for God and other people, as well as the wisdom to express that love\nappropriately (Phil. 1:9-11) in concrete situations as Jesus did. </p>\n\n<p>Moral character development should be seen as of primary importance both for the\nindividual's personal ethical development and, by extension, for the development of a\nchurch and then a society which reflects God's values.</p>\n\n<h3>Hermeneutical Approach</h3>\n\n<p>How one interprets the Bible is the critical question in Christian ethics, and it is a\nquestion which is not easily resolved. A bewildering array of questions faces the\nChristian ethicist: How do we go about finding the rules and values of scripture? How do\nwe integrate the unity and the diversity of scripture - specifically, what role does\nsalvation history play in developing our ethics? How do we discern what is cultural and\nwhat is trans-cultural? How binding are the applications of scriptural rules? What\nguidance does the Bible give for new applications of those rules? These questions are\nprofound and can only be touched on in this paper. </p>\n\n<p>It seems obvious that the <i>boundary conditions</i> would be expressed throughout the\nBible. We would expect to find these timeless moral absolutes expressed often and every\nliterary genre of the canon. We would expect that the major covenants in scripture (i.e.\nMosaic and New) would continue to emphasize rather than negate them, since they constitute\nthe purpose of God which <i>is</i> the goal of salvation history. </p>\n\n<p><i>Values</i> seem to be relatively easy to distill from scripture. One can read God's\noriginal commission to man in the early chapter's of Genesis and get a basic picture of\nthe way in which God ideally wants man to relate to Himself, other men and nature.\nExamining descriptions of the rule of Christ after His return (regardless of one's\nmillennial view) yields a very detailed description of the same values which God wants for\nman. </p>\n\n<p>The problem area in values is not in understanding what they are, but rather in how to <i>prioritize</i>\nthose values in the stage of God's redemptive plan in which we now find ourselves. For the\nfall has shattered the kind of world God desired for man. God is in the process of\nrestoring man and the world to the way He desires it, and He will accomplish that goal\nafter the return of Christ. But until that day, we live in a fallen, abnormal world in\nwhich it is impossible for all of God's values to be realized. The reason for this is\nobvious. God's purposes for man are built on the foundation of man being in right\nrelationship with Him. Since the majority of people are not reconciled to God, and since\neven those who are reconciled to Him still have fallen natures, there is a fundamental\nimpossibility of all of His values being realized in human society at this present time. </p>\n\n<p>This fact has great implications for the area of values in Christian ethics. While one\nmust hold all of God's values to be true and perfect, one must prioritize which of these\nvalues be given greatest attention. and decide how he will approach pursuing those values.\nIn other words, it is impossible to separate ethics from salvation history. If we believe\nthat God has a strategy for accomplishing His goal (to bring the world back under His\nloving rulership), then how we see God pursuing that goal and what specific stage we see\nGod to be in must become our guideline for <i>what</i> values we as God's people will\nstress most and <i>how</i> to go about working for them. </p>\n\n<p>It is my contention that such guidance is available to us in the New Testament and\nspecifically in those passages in the New Testament which explain the role of the church,\nthe Body of Christ. This is the stage of God's program which we ourselves are in.\nTherefore, we can look to these passages to find what God says are our primary objectives,\nand also to discover how God says those objectives are to be pursued. </p>\n\n<p>It seems self-evident that the overriding mission of the church is to be Christ's\nwitness so that people from every ethnic group in the world will come back to the right\nrelation with God through Him and His work on the cross.<a name=\"Footnote3A\">Footnote3</a>\nTo this end, verbal evangelistic mission is obviously highly prioritized. So also is the\nsanctification of individual Christians and the church, since we as Christians and the\nBody of Christ are the presence of Christ in the world - the light of the world<a name=\"Footnote4A\">Footnote4</a>, the salt of the earth<a name=\"Footnote5A\">Footnote5</a>,\nthe pillar and support of the truth<a name=\"Footnote6A\">Footnote6</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, the New Testament gives priority to witness over socially perfecting\nexisting human society. While the church is to be a \"new society\" that shows the\nworld the kind of society God wills for man, even this is ultimately so that lost people\nmay come to Christ<a name=\"Footnote7A\">Footnote7</a>. The reason for this is obvious: it\ntakes regenerated people to have a regenerated society. The church has a responsibility to\nactualize the \"new society\" of the Body of Christ. While that actualizing\nprocess may even (and has) influence secular society for good, to make the betterment of\nsecular society the priority is both unscriptural and unreasonable. How can we expect\nunregenerate people to love God's way and be able to follow it? To assert this is to deny\nthe biblical view of man's depravity and to undercut the value of Christ's death<a name=\"Footnote8A\">Footnote8</a>. </p>\n\n<p>So it should not surprise us to see that the New Testament has relatively little or\nnothing to say about changing the secular institutions of its day. I do not believe that\nthe reason for this is merely because they were politically unable to change it. Rather,\nthey did not focus on bettering secular institutions because Christ's strategy was far\nmore biblical and radical: to change human society by changing humans through reconciling\nthem to Jesus Christ through the gospel. </p>\n\n<p>Longenecker agrees that this was the real reason for Paul's \"relaxed\"\nattitude concerning the institution of slavery in the first century world.<a name=\"Footnote9A\">Footnote9</a> It was not that Paul was \"relaxed\" about\nslavery; it was that he was <i>more</i> concerned about mission/witness because he\ncorrectly saw that only when society is deeply permeated with vital Christian churches can\nsignificant social change occur. Paul was <i>forced</i> to prioritize God's values, and he\ndid so according to Christ's commission for himself and the church. Our situation has not\nmaterially changed today. Though Christians can exert more political influence, we still\nface an unregenerate society dominated by a non-Christian consensus. Therefore, the first\npriority must be evangelism, the vitality of the church and church planting domestically\nand abroad. To focus first on the betterment of secular society is to violate not only the\nexample of the New Testament church, but also its theology.<a name=\"Footnote10A\">Footnote10</a>\n</p>\n\n<p>The New Testament must also be our guide on <i>how</i> to pursue God's values for this\nstage in His plan. It is here that the New Testament emphasis on grace is so crucial.\nGod's people have discovered the grace of God. They are to proclaim that grace to\nnon-Christians, live under that grace in their own lives and approach other believers\nconsistently with the grace that God has shown them. </p>\n\n<p>This emphasis on grace is in contrast to an emphasis on law: specifically on imposing\nGod's law on non-Christians, on relating to God nomistically<a name=\"Footnote11A\">Footnote11</a>,\nand on relating to other Christians nomistically. This insight has tremendous implications\nfor Christian ethics. </p>\n\n<p>To pursue God's values by grace means first of all that Christians are not to impose\nGod's ethics/values on non-Christians. This is in contrast to the Mosaic Covenant, in\nwhich God imposed His law on unbelieving Jews. If we are to be consistent with scripture,\nwe must admit that that situation, while necessary, was inferior to God's way today.<a name=\"Footnote12A\">Footnote12</a> Today God does not call non-Christians to keep His law -\nHe calls them first to come to know Him personally. This is why we see the New Testament\nChristians refusing to impose Christian ethics on non-Christians<a name=\"Footnote13A\">Footnote13</a>.\nJesus was not intent on getting the woman at the well to change her sexual behavior, but\non getting her to accept the free gift of living water, which would then change her whole\nlife from the inside out.<a name=\"Footnote14A\">Footnote14</a> </p>\n\n<p>To pursue God's values by grace also means to seek sanctification (or <i>moral\ncharacter</i> <i>development</i>) by relating to God personally and depending on the power\nof the Holy Spirit to change us<a name=\"Footnote15A\">Footnote15</a>. This is in contrast\nto pursuing sanctification through a rule and task-oriented approach, which inevitably\nbecomes impersonal and self-energized. Longenecker calls this \"nomism\", as\ndistinct from \"legalism\", which refers to seeking justification by works. He\ncorrectly notes that nomism was a part of God's plan under the Mosaic Covenant, but again,\nthis was necessary because the Jews did not have the indwelling of the Holy Spirit and the\nadoption as sons (Gal. 4:3-7). But this was an inferior way to approach sanctification and\nis now ruled out by God in favor of \"walking by the Spirit\" under grace. </p>\n\n<p>Understanding this has definite impact on the success of God's purpose for the church -\nmission and witness. Christians who relate to God nomistically will not be vital examples\nof the Spirit-filled life. They will misrepresent the gift God wants to give them through\nJesus Christ. Their churches will be more like miniature Israels under the Mosaic Covenant\nthan like the vibrant churches of the New Testament which attracted people to the grace of\nGod and a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ.</p>\n\n<h3>Applying Biblical Ethics to Today</h3>\n\n<p>One problem for all Christian ethical approaches is how to apply the biblical ethics to\na society that is two thousand to thirty-five hundred years removed the biblical period.\nOn the one hand, there is the danger of making the biblical material irrelevant by\noveremphasizing the change in and uniqueness of contemporary society. On the other hand,\nthere is the equal and opposite danger of ignoring or straight-jacketing culture by\nrefusing to acknowledge societal change. All biblical Christians must wrestle with the\nfact that the Bible does not speak to many very real and pressing ethical issues created\nby our own society<a name=\"Footnote16A\">Footnote16</a>. This is another aspect of the\nhermeneutical issue involved in Christian ethics. </p>\n\n<p>The theonomist approach to ethics is an example of an approach which seeks to keep the\nrelevance of specific biblical ethical commands intact and relevant. It insists that the\nOld Testament (or New Testament) Law is applicable \"in exhaustive detail\" to\ntoday's society<a name=\"Footnote17A\">Footnote17</a>. It can and should be applied to\nsociety wherever presently possible, and society should be changed wherever necessary so\nthat all of it can eventually be applied. </p>\n\n<p>The most serious critique of this approach, in my opinion, is that the New Testament\napostles clearly demonstrate that they did not apply either the Old Testament Law or\nJesus' \"law\" in exhaustive detail. Rather, they discerned the <i>principles</i>\nunderlying those laws and applied that principle to their own situations according to the\nstage of salvation history in which they were, and/or according to the cultural or\nsituational setting in which they found themselves. </p>\n\n<p>Examples of this kind of application abound - a few will suffice. In 1 Cor. 9:8-11,\nPaul applies the principle underlying the Mosaic law of not muzzling the ox while one is\nthreshing to the payment of Christian workers. He seems to specifically call attention to\nthe principle <i>rather than</i> the specific Old Testament application of that principle\nin vs. 9 and 10. In 1 Cor. 7:12-15, Paul adds another reason for permissible divorce (i.e.\nthe unbelieving spouse's desertion or unwillingness to consent to live with a believer) to\nthat of Jesus' (i.e. immorality). Though this is a hotly debated passage, it at least\nseems clear that Paul feels the freedom to give an application to the principle laid down\nby Moses and Jesus (that sometimes divorce is regrettably necessary) which they themselves\ndid not give. This is possibly because they did not face the same societal situations\nwhich Paul faced. </p>\n\n<p>Such passages seem to discredit the theonomist approach to biblical laws. They also\nsupport the \"principles\" approach which seeks to discern, wherever possible, the\nprinciples underlying specific biblical commands, and then to apply them faithfully to\ncurrent situations. Though there is inevitably more interpretive ambiguity with this\napproach than with the theonomist approach, it allows the Bible to speak to more issues\ntoday without becoming excessively rigid or forcing society to change to fit the society\nof biblical times. </p>\n\n<p>The contextualist approach attempts to reduce the ethical content of the Bible to one\noverriding principle - love<a name=\"Footnote18A\">Footnote18</a>. This approach says that\nlife is too complex for laws or rules (\"boundary conditions\"). The <i>one</i>\nmandatory thing is to act in love. While the Bible may be consulted to see examples of how\npeople acted in love, these examples should not be permitted to become new\n\"laws\". Each ethical situation is totally unique and therefore each ethical\nchoice must also be existential and unique. The desire to rely on \"laws\" is\nscorned as a sure sign of spiritual weakness like that exhibited by the Pharisees. </p>\n\n<p>This approach makes the opposite mistake that the theonomist approach makes. Whereas\nthe theonomist approach seeks to apply not only the biblical principles, but also <i>all</i>\nof the biblical specific case laws, the contextualist approach ignores all but one of the\nbiblical principles. The crucial problem for the contextualist is to have any idea of <i>how</i>\nto know what is loving without additional ethical guidance. To be loving is more of a <i>motive</i>\nwhich must underlie our actions than concrete direction for what actions to choose. This\nis why the Old and New Testaments always combine the admonition to be loving with more\nspecific moral content. Clearly, more than one ethical principle is given in the Bible.\nClearly also, many \"boundary conditions\" are given. Though one may argue about\nhow to resolve dilemmas in which one \"boundary condition\" must be broken, to\nsimply throw overboard all of the \"boundary conditions\" seems neither\nscripturally consistent nor practically feasible since love by itself is an inadequate\nfoundation for ethical decisions. </p>\n\n<p>The above critique of the contextualist approach also lends support for the\n\"principles\" approach in the area of application. The \"principles\"\nethicist will seek to discover in any given situation what \"boundary conditions\"\napply. He will also seek to discover what biblical principles (including love) apply. He\nwill also consult the Bible for examples of similar situations for further help. Thus, the\n\"principles\" approach makes fuller use of the Bible than does the contextualist\napproach. </p>\n\n<p>The \"principles\" approach is not, however, without its problems. Foremost\namong its problems is bridging the gap between biblical application of God's principles\nand values and contemporary application of them. Longenecker's suggestion is that we view\nthe New Testament application of the gospel of Jesus, not as case laws, but as paradigms\nor examples of how to apply the gospel to our own day<a name=\"Footnote19A\">Footnote19</a>.\nI find this suggestion to be very helpful. Something like this is necessary for the\n\"principles\" ethicist. As was stated earlier, examining how the Bible gives\nspecific application to its own values and principles must be considered a valuable source\nof wisdom in making such contemporary applications. </p>\n\n<p>But Longenecker goes beyond this to suggest two things which are highly questionable in\nmy opinion. The most serious suggestion is that there is some kind of \"progressive\nrevelation\" going on in church history as to how to apply the gospel<a name=\"Footnote20A\">Footnote20</a>. A logical implication of this position is that we must\nconsult church history in order to understand this progressive unfolding of how to apply\nthe gospel<a name=\"Footnote21A\">Footnote21</a>, and that such consultation may yield\napplicational guidance as authoritative as the scriptural guidance itself<a name=\"Footnote22A\">Footnote22</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In all fairness to Longenecker, my objection to these statements may be a result of not\nunderstanding him properly. But this in itself is a criticism, because one must be careful\nto speak clearly on a matter as important as the one under discussion. If Longenecker is\nsaying that God is faithful to through the Holy Spirit to supply wisdom to apply the\ngospel to today, I have no quarrel with him. This would be the \"illuminating\"\nministry of the Holy Spirit which Paul says is available to all Christians (Eph. 1:17;\nCol. 1:9-11; Phil. 1:9-11). However, it is not clear that Longenecker is saying only this.\n</p>\n\n<p>If he is saying that God actually inspires believers through church history in their\nformulation and application of the gospel, I must disagree. The promises of Jn. 14-16\nconcerning the Holy Spirit are given to the disciples, <i>not</i> to all Christians. Only\nwhen we find other New Testament passages which apply the same ministries of the Spirit to\nall believers can we make such application today. Even if Longenecker's interpretation of\nMatt. 13:52 is correct, one is still faced with the fact that it was spoken to the\ndisciples and <i>not</i> to all Christians. In other words, the ministry of inspiration\nseems to be given only to the apostles. Only <i>their</i> words and writings were to be\ntaken as the Word of God (1 Thess. 2:13; 2 Thess. 2:15). </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, there is the very dangerous tendency for uninspired application of\nscripture to become equal to and then superior to scripture itself in authority. This was\nwhat Jesus rebuked the Pharisees for in Mk. 7. Such a rebuke is equally applicable to\nchurch leaders throughout church history. The big problem in church history is not that\nleaders do not consult church history, but that they consult it too much and too\nuncritically. To say this is not to say that church history cannot yield great help in\nunderstanding how to apply scripture. It is only to say that such a task must be done very\ncarefully and with real insistence that scripture alone is the final judge of church\nhistory. Actually, church history may be much more profitable as a guide on what <i>not</i>\nto do, what mistakes <i>not</i> to fall into, than as a positive guide in the sense that\nLongenecker suggests. </p>\n\n<p>The Christian leader should apply the gospel to his day. He should depend upon the Holy\nSpirit for wisdom to do so. But he should not take the position that his applications of\nthe gospel are of equal authority or inspiration to those of the apostles. He cannot say ,\n\"I say, not the Lord\" in the same authoritative way that Paul could (1 Cor.\n7:12). He cannot say about such applications \"If anyone does not recognize this, he\nis not recognized\" (1 Cor. 14:38). He must view the apostolic applications as\ninspired, but he may not view his own applications that way.<br>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Ethical Dilemmas</h3>\n\n<p>Another point of contrast between ethical approaches is the subject of ethical\ndilemmas. Are there situations in which we must violate God's boundary conditions? If so,\nhow do we decide which to break? Is violating the boundary condition wrong in that case?\nThe implications of this subject are far too detailed to cover in this paper. A simple\ncomparison of the three approaches' views on this issue is all that can be attempted here.\n</p>\n\n<p>My understanding of the theonomist approach is that it would hold that such ethical\ndilemmas do exist and that one should violate the lesser of the boundary conditions. It\nwould also say that this violation, though perhaps necessary, is still wrong. It would say\nadditionally that such ethical dilemmas are not primarily the result of living in a fallen\nworld, but more specifically the consequence of not structuring society according to\nbiblical (Old Testament or New Testament) case laws in exhaustive detail. Thus, such\nethical dilemmas provide additional incentive to structure society thusly. </p>\n\n<p>The concept that ethical dilemmas are the consequence of previous disobedience to God's\nwill is an appealing one. One may think of many examples in which this seems to be the\ncase<a name=\"Footnote23A\">Footnote23</a>. It is even possible that the previous wrong\nchoices of others may have the same result in the lives of a later generation<a name=\"Footnote24A\">Footnote24</a>. This seems to be a biblical position, in that Adam's\nfall may be the ultimate source of all ethical dilemmas. If this be so, nothing short of a\nnew humanity could alleviate the human race of indigenous ethical dilemmas. It is just\nthis that Jesus Christ came to inaugurate (Rom. 5:12-19). </p>\n\n<p>My problem with the theonomist's understanding of ethical dilemmas lies not in their\nassessment of ethical dilemmas, but in the solution they offer. To go back to the case\nlaws of Old Testament Israel would be wrong for the reasons described previously in this\npaper. Furthermore, it would not really alleviate ethical dilemmas. The Old Testament\ncivil law does not speak specifically to the many medical and technological ethical\ndilemmas which exist in today's society. To advocate going back to second millennia B.C.\nmedicine in order to escape from these dilemmas is hardly an \"ethical\" answer! </p>\n\n<p>The contextualist approach would hold that no true ethical dilemmas exist. While the\nhuman situation is so complex that no set of laws can ever avoid the trap of ethical\ndilemmas described in the above sense, this only proves the inadequacy of a\n\"laws\", multiple absolutist approach. The contextualist holds that the only\nabsolute is to act in love, and that therefore as along as one acts in love, there can be\nno true ethical dilemmas. </p>\n\n<p>This approach does eliminate ethical dilemmas in the technical sense of the term, but\nit pays too high a price for doing so. Because of the critique of this approach offered\nearlier, it is difficult to see how contextualism is ultimately any different than moral\nrelativism. To sacrifice all moral guidance in the process of escaping from the\npossibility of experiencing ethical dilemmas is unscriptural and unwise. </p>\n\n<p>The principles approach described in this paper would hold that ethical dilemmas are a\npart of man's fallen condition. Both because of poor individual choices and because of the\ncorporate solidarity of humanity, we can find ourselves in situations in which one of\nGod's boundary conditions must be broken. This approach would advocate seeking to do\n\"the lesser of two evils\" in that situation. But that choice would still be\nwrong and the individual would be unable to justify himself - he would still be morally\nresponsible to God for his choice. Such experiences, like others in a fallen world (Gen\n3:16-19), should make us see the abnormality of our condition and drive us to Christ for\nforgiveness and further sanctification.<a name=\"Footnote25A\">Footnote25</a> </p>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>Although no biblical ethical approach is without problems, the \"principles\"\napproach described above is the superior approach. When compared to the other approaches\nstudied, it affords overall the most extensive use of scripture and the most application\nto contemporary society. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\">Return to the Essays page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to the Xenos home page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:DeLashmuttG@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=christian%20ethics\">Ask\nGary a question or share a comment.</a> </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><a name=\"Footnote1B\">Footnote1</a> </p>\n\n<p>Arthur F.

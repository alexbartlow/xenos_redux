The following is a simple list of moods of verbs in the New Testament and what\nthey generally signify: \n</p><ol class=\"style1\"><ol><li>indicative - mood of certainty, actuality </li>\n    <li>subjunctive - mood of probability </li>\n    <li>optative - mood of possibility </li>\n    <li>imperative - mood of command </li>\n  </ol></ol><p class=\"style1\">As the list indicates, the New Testament uses indicative statements when discussing\nwhat God has done, is doing or will do. Imperative statements are used when saying what we\nshould do. It is important to realize, not only that both moods are present in the Bible,\nbut that <b>there is a specific relationship between these two moods in the area of\nsanctification</b>. Namely, what God commands us to do (the imperative) is based upon what\nhe has done, is doing or will do (the indicatives). God is signifying by this consistent\npattern that sanctification depends on God, but involves human volition and cooperation.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Examples</h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">In the following examples, the imperative mood is underlined, while the indicative is\nin italics. </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">Romans 6:1-19 and 8:1-13 are two of the best examples of this relationship, covered in\ndetail in <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/wiv.htm\">Walking in Victory</a> </h5>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">Philippians 2:12b-13</h5>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>. . .<u>work out your salvation with fear and trembling</u>, for it is God who works in\n  you to will and to act according to his good purpose. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">In this example, we see that the imperative command to work out our salvation is based\non the fact that God is at work in us. The use of the word \"for\" indicates\ndependence or causality. </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">Colossians 3:1-17 Colossians 3:1-16</h5>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p><i>Since, then, you have been raised with Christ</i>, set your hearts on things above,\n  where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on\n  earthly things. <i>For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God</i>. <i>When\n  Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory</i>. Put to\n  death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity,\n  lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry. <i>Because of these, the wrath of God is\n  coming.</i> You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived. But now you must\n  rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy\n  language from your lips. Do not lie to each other, <i>since you have taken off your old\n  self with its practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge\n  in the image of its Creator. Here there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised,\n  barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all</i>. Therefore, as\n  God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness,\n  humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances\n  you may have against one another. Forgive <i>as the Lord forgave you</i>. And over all\n  these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity. Let the peace\n  of Christ rule in your hearts, <i>since as members of one body you were called to peace</i>.\n  And be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one\n  another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns and spiritual songs with gratitude\n  in your hearts to God. And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name\n  of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Again, by looking at the linkage between the statements (e.g. words like\n\"since\" \"for\" \"as\" and \"because\"), you will notice\nthe imperatives are dependent on indicative statements. When we consider the thought\ndevelopment in this passage we realize Paul is at pains to regularly remind his readers of\nthe basis for each ethical instruction. </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">Hebrews 10:19-25</h5>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>Therefore, brothers, <i>since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the\n  blood of Jesus, by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his\n  body</i>, and <i>since we have a great priest over the house of God</i>, <u>let us draw\n  near to God with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled\n  to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water. Let\n  us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful. And let us\n  consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds. Let us not give up\n  meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another--and\n  all the more as you see the Day approaching</u>. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">In this passage, no fewer than five separate imperatives are tied to two wonderful\nindicatives: our confidence to enter the holy place by the new way, and our great high\npriest. Notice the word \"since\" before both indicative statements, indicating\nthat they provide the basis for the imperatives to follow. </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">Ephesians 4:32</h5>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p><u>Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other</u>, <i>just as in\n  Christ God forgave you</i>. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">It is because God has forgiven us that we should forgive others. Compare this to the\nstatement in Matthew 6:14,15, where God's forgiveness is conditional on our forgiving\nothers. The formulation in Matthew is typical of the sermon on the mount, with teaches the\ntrue nature of the law. There, the imperative is the <i>condition</i> for God's\nforgiveness, not a response to it.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Dynamic Relationship</h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The New Testament also teaches that, although the imperatives are based upon the\nindicatives, in many cases the <i>experience</i> of the indicatives is dependent upon our\nwillingness to respond to the imperatives by faith. In other words, if I fail to act in\nfaith based on what God has commanded, I may not experience the reality of my position in\nChrist. Of course my position is no less real, but I may not experience it in the way God\nwants me to. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">This corrects a common misconception among Christians: that even after we have\nunderstood God's promises, we should wait until we experience God's power, forgiveness,\netc. before we act on what He says to do. On the contrary, we must act in the knowledge of\nthe indicatives before we actually sense or experience the truth. Thus, the biblical order\nis not LEARN--EXPERIENCE--ACT, but rather LEARN--ACT--EXPERIENCE. This also corrects the\nerroneous position that man's response is not important in sanctification. Of course, our\nexperience is not unimportant either, especially when it is understood in its proper\nplace. </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\"><b>EXAMPLES </b>- You may enjoy examining this relationship in the following passages:</h5>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Romans 12:1; John 13:17; I Pet. 2:2; Romans 6:15; I Pet. 3:7; Romans 8:4-13; I John\n3:14,18,19; Galatians 5:16-23; Jas. 1:21-24; 1 Peter 2:9-12; 2 Peter 1:3-9; I John. 4:19</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a name=\"DDE_LINK1\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/outlines.htm\">Return to the Outlines\npage</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to the Xenos home page</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=indicative%20moods\">Ask\nDennis a question or share a comment.</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"mailto:DeLashmuttG@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=indicative%20moods\">Ask Gary\na question or share a comment.</a> </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n</body></div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Indicative & Imperative Moods","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/indic.htm"}

Tourn argues that during this\nperiod, Waldo was influenced by \"the Cathari, Pierre de Bruys, the monk Henri and\nothers.\"52 From these schismatics, they heard stiff criticism of the Roman Catholic\nChurch. </p>\n\n<p>For the first time, the movement began to include radical protest in its views.\nClearly, there was a need to re-define their views on the sacraments, and other features\nof ecclesiology, since they no longer had access to these \"means of grace\"\nthrough the Church. Yet the shift seems to have been minimal, especially in the area of\nsoteriology. There was still no breakthrough in the area of salvation by grace. On the\nother hand, all of the changes that did occur during this period were in the same\ndirection as later reform movements. </p>\n\n<p>Adding momentum to change was the merger with some northern Italian splinter groups.\nThese groups heard in the preaching of the Poor of Lyons views that they already held.\nLatourette says that the Waldensians were \". . .joined by many of the Humiliati, who\nhad arisen in and near Milan and in that same year (1184) had come under Papal\nprohibition. . . They criticized prayers in Latin on the ground that they were not\nunderstood by the people, and derided church music and the canonical hours.\"53 </p>\n\n<p>These dissidents were established before the time of Waldo, and tended to have a more\ncommunal ideal in their piety. They probably had the effect of stabilizing a movement\nwhich was devoted to vagrancy by providing centers of agitation (this also made them easy\nto locate, and therefore vulnerable). Milan had such a welcoming attitude that they\npermitted the Waldensians to build their own house of prayer. This may have been the only\noccasion on which they could openly have such a building for the next 300 years. </p>\n\n<p>The Lombards, as the North Italian group was called, had many ideas of their own. They\nwere actually thrown out of the Waldensian movement in 1205 by Waldo, but later re-joined.\n</p>\n\n<p>Melia, who argues that the Waldensians were not Protestant in their doctrine, can be\ncounted on to refuse all exaggeration in the area of the Poor's evangelical beliefs. He\ndoes admit (and documents each from more than one authentic Waldensian source) the\nfollowing listing of their divergent views during the period before the Hussite\nrevolution. \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li>The Church of God has failed. </li>\n  <li>The Holy Scriptures alone are sufficient to guide men to Salvation. </li>\n  <li>The blessings and consecrations practiced in the Church do not confer any particular\n    sanctity upon the things or persons blessed or consecrated. </li>\n  <li>Catholic priests. . .have no authority; and the Pope of Rome is the chief of all\n    heresiarchs. </li>\n  <li>Everyone has the right to preach publicly the word of God </li>\n  <li>Every oath is a mortal sin.54 </li>\n  <li>Purgatory is a dream, an invention of the sixth century. </li>\n  <li>The indulgences of the Church are an invention of covetous Priests. </li>\n  <li>There is no obligation to fast, nor to keep any holy day, Sunday excepted. </li>\n  <li>The invocation of Saints cannot be admitted. </li>\n  <li>Every honor given in the Church to the holy images of paintings, and to the relics of\n    Saints is to be abolished. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>To this list, he adds doctrines that belong to the period between the Hussite revolt\nand the Lutheran Revolution: \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li>Auricular Confession is useless, and. . .it is enough to confess our sins to God. </li>\n  <li>The definition of the church is, \"the whole of the elect from the beginning of the\n    world to its end.\" and that regarding ministries, \"the holy Catholic Church is\n    the congregation of all ministers and people obeying the Divine will, and by obedience\n    united. . .\" </li>\n  <li>It is necessary to receive the Eucharist under two kinds.55 </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>To these I would add, \n\n</p><ol>\n  <li>The church and the state should remain as separate authorities.56 </li>\n  <li>The Eucharist is to be viewed as a memorial, not as a sacrifice.57 </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You can see that <b>every one of these doctrines are the natural outgrowth of exclusion\nfrom the Roman Church</b>. It was natural that the Poor of Lyons, feeling that they had\nacted out of devotion to God from the beginning, would wonder whether denial of access to\nthe priestly functions of the Roman Church could alter their destiny. Especially with the\nBible in their own language, it was natural that they would re-examine these issues, and\nultimately deny Roman Catholic teaching in these areas. Therefore the rejection of\npriestly function in the church was probably done in reaction to the action of the Roman\nChurch, rather than being a native sentiment of the movement. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding the last point, on the Eucharist, it may be asked how the Waldensians thought\nthey would obtain salvation, since Roman Catholic doctrine has the grace of God becoming\neffective through the sacraments. Here, it seems that no clear answer is available.\nApparently, the worshiper is to do his/her best to be good, and ask forgiveness from God\nfor the rest. There was also confession to a \"barba\" (\"uncle\" or\nteacher-leader) and prayer on behalf of the penitent.58 Unfortunately, the grace aspect of\nHuss' teaching seems to have been substantially lost on the Waldensians. </p>\n\n<p>Given these tenets, there does not seem to be warrant for referring to \"two\nreformations\" as does Amedo Molnar--the first being the Hussite and the Waldensian\nmovements, and the second, being the movements of the sixteenth century.59 At the same\ntime, it must be admitted that these two movements did make a substantial though\nincomplete movement back toward the biblical model. The Waldensian movement was a\nrevolution based on radical ecclesiology, but without substantial change in soteriology.\nTheir contribution should not be disregarded any more than the Lutheran and Calvinists,\nwho continued to accept defective doctrine in the area of eschatology and ecclesiology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/waldo1.htm\">Go back to the Waldensian table of contents</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/chhist.htm\">Go back to the Church History page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/waldo6.htm\">Read on to the next section in \"Waldensians\"</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Go back to the Xenos home page</a> \n\n</p><dl>\n  <dt><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=waldensian\">Ask Dennis a\n    question or share a comment.</a> </dt>\n</dl>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Waldensian Movement From Waldo to the Reformation IV","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/waldo5.htm"}

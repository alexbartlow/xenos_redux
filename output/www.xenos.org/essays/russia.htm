To the amazement of Westerners, the entire system of centralized\nsocialism is coming unraveled. As countries under communist rule have succumbed to despair\nin their economic and governmental system, the bankruptcy of Marxism as an ideology has\nbeen unmistakably revealed. Meanwhile, capitalism and democracy continue to flourish\nwherever they are practiced. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Biblical Christians are not surprised at the demise of Marxism, because we have known\nall along that Marx and Lenin failed to come to grips with the truth about the human race\nas revealed in Scripture. The Bible reveals that people were created with the urge to\ncreatively accomplish something significant. Even before the fall, God placed humans in\nthe garden to \"cultivate it and keep it.\" He also ordered humankind to \". .\n.fill the earth and subdue it, and rule. . ..\" Here we see that even in paradise,\npeople were not left to sit around and <i>exist</i>. Created in God's image, people looked\nforward to ownership, sovereignty, and accomplishment. Telling a human to pedal an\nexercise bicycle daily for the rest of his/her life and ignore the question of whether\nthere are any results is contrary to the image of God built in from the beginning. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The fall of Adam and Eve has not made socialism any more likely, but in fact, even\nless. The socialistic idea--\"from each according to his ability, to each according to\nhis need\" -- sounds nice as an ethic. But to make this kind of ethic a reality in\nhuman society, we would have to eliminate all human selfishness! People who are in a\nfallen state would have to be willing to produce as much as they could while settling for\nno more than what they need. Also, an elite would have to be trusted to administrate the\nwhole system without taking any more than they needed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Unfortunately, the Bible says that the heart of man is \"deceitful above all things\nand beyond cure\" and that \"There is no one righteous, not even one.\" (Jer.\n17:9; Rom. 3:10) Neither the factory worker at his machine, nor the bureaucrat at his desk\ncan be relied upon to do all they can regardless of whether they receive personal benefit\nin the process. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">As a result, under socialism, factory workers and bureaucrats have developed an\napathetic <i>chore</i> mentality that has gradually bankrupted the economies of all of the\ncountries operating under that system. This apathetic mentality develops when work is not\nexciting, challenging or rewarding, because the individual doesn't stand to gain anything\nfrom hard work. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The really sad part to the Christian observer is that the problems of socialism not\nonly affect communist countries; they also afflict the modern Christian church. A moment\nof reflection will reveal that many churches today have a lot in common with Russian\nfactories, including the same unmotivated mentality in its members.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Motivation</h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">In businesses that are privately owned, success results in increased wealth. But\nsuccess in a socialist factory will probably result in nothing, unless perhaps the worker\nreceives a meaningless medal or a plaque on the wall. More recently, factories have been\nissuing \"coupons\" for hard work, which are supposed to help the recipient buy\nconsumer goods, but there aren't enough goods to buy even with coupons. As a result,\nRussian workers and managers are generally less creative and less motivated than their\nWestern counterparts. Since the advent of <i>Glasnost</i>, Western audiences have been\ntreated to TV reports showing Russian restaurant workers standing around smoking while\ntheir customers wait for service. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">When factories and businesses are not owned by individuals operating on a profit\nmotive, there simply is none of the entrepreneurial spirit that so animates Western\nbusiness. This is to be expected when we remember the Bible's description of human nature.\nWhen we cannot perceive any immediate goal or significance to our task, it becomes tedious\nand burdensome. This will break down motivation over the long haul, even for the\ncommitted. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">In Russia, workers are admonished to excel at their labor for the glory of world\nsocialism. But even for those who believe in socialistic ideals, this turns out to be too\ndistant and theoretical to stimulate hard work day-in and day-out. Here, Christians are\nurged to witness and engage in ministry based on biblical command. Unfortunately, the\nfrequent reliance on biblical imperative leads to a <i>chore</i> mentality. We may\ndutifully jab at the job, but whether there are very many results is not really important.\nAfter all, the Bible calls on us to witness, not necessarily to succeed. Like their\nRussian counterparts, American Christians end up standing around chatting while their\ncustomers wait for service. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Like the Russian factory worker, the average church member finds it difficult to say,\nor to feel, what the real immediate benefit of successful evangelism and discipleship is.\nEven the benefits they can name are (like Russian coupons and plaques) of comparatively\nlittle value in their eyes. The proof of this is the fact that so little successful\nevangelism goes on in most of our churches. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Of course we get to see people attain eternal life and we can meditate on the fact that\nwe will someday receive eternal reward. These incentives should be adequate from an\nidealistic standpoint, but they are long-term. They need to be supplemented by near-term\nbenefits. Even authentic Christians with the power of the Holy Spirit and the Christian\nworld view have to fight the inertia of our lower natures. Besides, the Spirit can and\ndoes use goal orientation and a sense of fulfillment and accomplishment to help us with\nflagging motivation. We will see the help God has offered us here when we turn to the\nbiblical evidence later. As far as the here-and-now, Christians need to answer the\nquestion, \"What are the real incentives for becoming involved in hazardous Christian\nwork?\"</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Innovation</h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Managers in Russian factories have little incentive to update designs and methods as\nlong as quotas are met. Russian and Eastern European car manufacturers, for instance, are\nstill using designs that are long obsolete because there is no incentive for up-dating.\nQuality also suffers. Quality workmanship is not necessary beyond the level that will keep\nthe worker out of trouble. We are amazed to see people in a modern technological country\nwaiting years to receive a car that is far below western standards. One recent newscast\nshowed East German factory workers using a breaker bar to straighten crooked doors on\nbrand new cars that would not close. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">When watching the weakness of socialistic factories, one is sometimes reminded of some\nchurches in America. Recently, leaders like Os Guinness have charged that American\nChristians are shallow, ignorant, and intellectually lazy. [Lecture at the ICBI,\nWashington, D.C. 1988] It is probably safe to say that only a fraction of the potential of\nmost local churches is ever really developed theologically or practically. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Change is usually uncomfortable and often unpopular with the old guard as well. In\nRussian factories, little change or originality is ever evident, and the resulting\nproducts are hopelessly obsolete and slow in delivery. American church leaders and members\nare also very resistant to change, especially if it goes beyond the most superficial area.\nThere is probably no institution in the western world as conservative as the church. Of\ncourse, we hope to see conservation of the pure gospel message. But our conservatism goes\neven into areas having nothing to do with the gospel. Our meetings, modes of\ncommunication, and cultural practices may be grossly obsolete, but there simply isn't\nsufficient reason to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Accepting risk</h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Risk taking is particularly unlikely in a setting where the premium is on staying out\nof trouble rather than on maximizing profits. Observers of eastern block countries have\nconsistently reported lack of initiative and innovation (particularly in the practical\nareas) in the work forces and governmental departments. Russian scientists tend to be\ntheorists who don't care about applying research. For instance, Russians have had laser\ntechnology as advanced as western scientists for about the same length of time, but are\nonly now beginning to apply any of the technologies to factory construction. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The Evangelical community in America is also sometimes paralyzed by fear. The dangers\nthat may accompany authentic delegation of ministry responsibility and decision making to\nlay leaders has been enough to deter most leaders even though the price has been high.\nEvangelicals will even refuse to countenance active participation in culturally normative\nactivities because it might be too risky, notwithstanding the loss of outreach that may\nresult. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">The Alternative</h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The beauty of capitalism is that it harnesses the built-in features of the human race\nto the task of production of wealth. Even fallen tendencies such as greed are not\nantithetical to success in a capitalistic economy. Especially in an environment where\nexcesses are curbed by a responsible government (and this part is important), capitalism\nseems to have been able to turn the nature of the human race to its own advantage, at\nleast in economic terms. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Interestingly, Jesus also seems to have made concessions to the human desire for\nwealth. He said, \"Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven. . ..\" Many\nstudents of scripture have been disturbed by this admonition. Doesn't this seem to be\nsuggesting that Christians should do the right thing for the wrong reason? Isn't Christ\nsuggesting that we should be selfless so that we can enjoy rewards for self? </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Clearly, there is a puzzle in this teaching. But the bottom line seems to be that Jesus\ndid not consider it bad to have added incentive for doing the will of God, beyond merely\ndoing the right thing. A number of other passages reiterate the teaching (I Cor. 3:10-15;\nI Cor. 9:23-27; Mt. 25:21 and parallels; II Tim. 4:7,8). In one of the most intriguing\nformulations of the idea of incentives, Paul says \"The hard working farmer should be\nthe first to receive a share of the crops.\" (II Tim. 2:6) He also says, \"Reflect\non what I am saying for the Lord will give you understanding into all this.\" (vs. 7)\nMany Christian leaders are reflecting on the statement, and wondering how to understand\nit. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">In missions, the power of forming truly indigenous churches has been discovered during\nthe past few decades. The local workers are more motivated when they truly take over\ncontrol of the ministry. When mission workers refuse to import professional outsiders, and\ninsist that the locals take possession of the task and the goals of the church, a more\nvigorous church takes shape. Yet in developed Christian countries we do not insist that\nthe local church develop its own leadership. We repeatedly see situations where members\nare urged to take on ministry roles, but when we need a new professional, we hire in an\noutsider. What does this say to our members? </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">On the other side of this discussion are the legitimate worries that people in the\nchurch \"take possession\" of ministry as though it belonged to them. Some\nchurches, including our own, have reported provincialism--a lack of concern for any part\nof the church other than our own particular ministry. At other times, we may see\npragmatism in ministry--unprincipled acts calculated to \"get the results\" even\nif by the wrong means. We steer a delicate course between the chore mentality and rampant\ngreed when, as leaders, we try to determine how to motivate our people. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">When will the church in developed countries realize the meaning of what Paul is saying\nand begin their own <i>Perestroika</i> (restructuring)? When will we turn away from\nsymbolic gestures of lay-leadership and allow lay Christian workers to emerge as true\nleaders in the church? When we do, they will begin to exhibit a new kind of creativity and\nenergy. But this energy cannot be the energy that is seen when people know they are\nbuilding their \"own ministry,\" not \"someone else's ministry.\" Instead,\nboth lay people and leaders must waive their ownership of ministry, and agree that the\nchurch is God's ministry. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The challenge that faces the leadership of the Western church today is to discover how\nto make members feel that they are directly benefiting from Christian work, especially\nwhen it is successful. As in socialistic societies, such delegation will require the\nleadership to make a painful decision to relinquish control. People will have to be\nallowed to build their own ministries without the deadening effect of overly controlling\nsupervision. All too often, a church member no sooner gets a successful home Bible study\nor other successful ministry going, than the church shows up to take over leadership of\nit. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The opposite extreme of anarchical capitalism, however, is not the answer. The church\nleadership should provide what government does in the West: a good infrastructure\n(facilities, training materials, equipping opportunities) and restraint from some of the\nworst (but not from all) abuses. We, as leaders, have to provide the structures and\nguidance that allows people to formulate and pursue ministry ideas with the help and\nencouragement of the rest of the church. This we now do through our ministry team\naccreditation and <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/map.htm\">assessment </a>processes. Today, it is\npossible for anyone with a good ministry idea to set up and do ministry with the\nassistance of the church, as long as they have a good plan and their idea is not\ncontradictory to the vision of the church. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">At the same time, we have to teach entrepreneurial ministry leaders to not forget the\nrest of the community or the ethical principles of altruistic service. This is no small\ntask. In Xenos, we now limit leadership to ethical and principled people who are prepared\nto put God's interests before their own through the <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/steam.htm\">Servant\nTeam</a>. The rest will be up to the free spontaneity of the Holy Spirit gifted Christians\nas they truly discover their role in the Body of Christ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Ask Dennis a\nquestion or share a comment.</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\">Back to the Essays page</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Back to the Xenos home page</a>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Russian Factory and the American Church: Lessons From Eastern Europe","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/russia.htm"}

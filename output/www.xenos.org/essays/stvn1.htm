In his excellent commentary on Acts, Howard Marshal says, </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">. . . the purpose of this speech is still much disputed. In form it is a lengthy\nrecital of Old Testament history, discussing in detail what appear to be insignificant\npoints and culminating in a bitter attack on the speaker's hearers. What is the speaker\ntrying to do?\" 1 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">later he complains, </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">. . .it is not clear what the theological point of the details is.\" 2 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">These are striking statements, coming, as they do, from one who demonstrates keen\ninsight throughout the text of Acts. Yet, they are hardly unusual. Dibelius is much\nstronger,The irrelevance of this speech has for long been the real problem of exegesis. It\nis, indeed, impossible to find a connection between the account of the history of Israel\nto the time of Moses (7:2-19) and the accusations against Stephen. . .The major part of\nthe speech shows no purpose whatever. . . </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">and finally, </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The most striking feature of this speech is the irrelevance of its main section.3 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Gealy asks, \". . . How are we to explain the fact that Steven does not really\nspeak to the charges brought against him?\"4 In fact, Gealy thinks that the whole text\nis so unrelated to the flow of the Steven narrative that 7:1-53 must be one of three\nconflated traditions, namely \"an anti-Jewish polemic which Luke fashioned into a\nspeech for his purposes.\"5 He thinks that the only point made in the speech is that\nthe history of Israel is \"a history of continual disobedience to God\".6 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Unfortunately, Gealy has missed the point of this brilliant speech. The speech is\ncertainly not anti-semitic,7 and the fact that Israel was disobedient to the law, though\nmentioned, plays a subordinate role in the thought development. It is only certain kinds\nof disobedience that Stephen focuses on. In fact, this speech is the lynch-pin in the\ntransition between Christianity as a localized ethnic religion, and a universal body.8\nStephen the Hellenist was able to see the implications of the Gospel to an extraordinary\ndegree. 9 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">While there are confusing sections in the speech, there are also sections that are well\nunderstood by modern interpreters. Commonly accepted motifs are: \n</p><ol class=\"style1\">\n  <li>The history of Israel demonstrates ineptitude (on the part of the leadership especially)\n    in seeing the hand of God and in recognizing His agents. </li>\n  <li>The Temple cultus has been misinterpreted all along, and should now be set aside.\n    10These motifs are clearly argued in this speech. This author has no objection to either\n    application. On the other hand, there must be more involved in the argument, because much\n    of the detailed material in the speech does not address these two points. There is still a\n    substantial body of detailed Old Testament material not included in the argument for these\n    two obvious points. It is this extra material (some of it strange), that is the focus of\n    this study. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">The Missing Message</h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The key to understanding the inclusion of seemingly irrelevant detail in Stephen's\nspeech is to realize that they deal with geography. The speech is overly concerned with\ngeography, and with the people's and God's relationship to it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">It is the argument of this paper that a mistake is being made by interpreters when the\nsecond purpose of Stephen's speech is limited to answering charges regarding the temple.\nThe nucleus of the thinking here is not only a response to the temple, but to the broader\nand more foundational concept of sacred space or sacred land.11 Stephen will argue that\nthe notion of sacred land, used by God in the past for communication purposes, was not,\nand should not be viewed as a limitation upon Him. \"God can work just fine without\nthe use of any sacred space,\" is Stephen's argument. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Only this broader understanding will account for all of the material in the speech, as\nwell as explaining the strategy Stephen follows in refuting the charges made against him.\nOne of the charges brought against Stephen was that he speaks against, \"this\nplace,\" (6:13).12 Marshal thinks that the accusation that Stephen blasphemed\n\"this holy place\" (tou hagiou topou toutou vs.14) is a reference to the temple.\nThis may be correct, even though the examples he cites do not use the word topos, but\nnaos.13 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Whether the phrase refers exclusively to the temple, or to the sacred area around it\n(Jerusalem, Mt. Zion or even Israel) it seems clear that the greater question of sacred\nspace in the sense of sacred land had come up in the debate earlier.14It would be hard to\nexaggerate the centrality of the sacred land of Israel in the understanding of the\ncovenantal blessings at the heart of Judaism at this time.15 At the heart of\nethnic-religious world views are the twin values of \"Race and Space,\" or to put\nit differently, \"Blood and Soil.\" </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">These values are hardly unique to first century Judaism. The same terms have been used\nto understand thought systems such as Naziism. Unfortunately, they would adequately\nsummarize the ethos of much of modern western Christianity. These values can be dangerous\nsubstitutes for real spirituality, and may stand as barriers to a truly universal, loving,\noutreaching, and caring form of Christianity. Most of the book of Acts is concerned with\nGod's efforts to overcome the inertia that emanates from the unbalanced application of\nthese two values in the name of religion. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">By speaking to the issue of sacred space, including the sacred city and sacred land of\nIsrael, Stephen's speech lays a firm ideological foundation for the subsequent movement of\nthe focus of God's work away from both in the following chapters. Immediately, we find\nPhilip putting into action the lateral movement that Stephen's analysis of Scripture so\nbeautifully justified. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Having asserted this theme, we can now briefly note how it is developed in the text of\nStephen's speech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/chhist.htm\">Go back to the Church History page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/summns.htm\">Go back to The Summons page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/stvn2.htm\">Read on into the next section of \"Strange Details\"</a> </p>\n\n<p>Download the whole \"Strange Details\" paper (32K) </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/stvn_a.htm\">Go back to the Strange Details Table of Contents</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Ask Dennis a\nquestion or share a comment.</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Bo back to the Xenos home page</a>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Strange Details in Stephen's Defense: A New Accounting","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/stvn1.htm"}

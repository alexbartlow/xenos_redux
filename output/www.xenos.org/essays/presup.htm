For instance, we may assume\nthat our eyes see a real world. These beginning points are called <i>presuppositions</i>\nbecause we pre-suppose our beginning points are true. Without presupposing something we\ncould not think or talk to each other. No one can avoid adopting some sort of\npresuppositions. But are our presuppositions consistent with our other beliefs? If not, we\nare a living contradiction. We say we believe one thing, but we really believe something\nelse. This line of thought leads to the conclusion that a personal infinite creator God\nexists, and that he has created us as spiritual and personal beings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">An illustration may be the easiest way to understand this argument [This illustration\nis adapted from a similar one by Richard Taylor, cited in John Hick, <i>Arguments for the\nExistence of God</i>. (New York: Herder and Herder, 1971), pp.23,24]. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Suppose two men are riding in a railway coach and glancing from the window at one of\nthe stops, they see numerous white stones scattered about on a hillside near the train in\na pattern resembling these letters: <b>THE CANADIAN RAILWAYS WELCOMES YOU TO CANADA</b>.\nOne man observes that it took a lot of work to arrange the stones in that pattern, but the\nother disagrees. The second man sees no proof that <i>any </i>work was expended on the\narrangement. After all, similar stones are scattered about on other parts of the hill, and\nthey could roll down the slope periodically. He argues that the rocks may have simply\nrolled <i>accidentally </i>into this curious arrangement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">At this point, the first man may feel that the second man is being credulous and\nirrational, but he has to admit that he has no actual proof (from where they are sitting)\nthat anyone arranged the rocks this way. He may feel his own explanation (that someone\npurposely arranged the rocks) is easier to believe than the accidental theory, but this\njudgment is based on probability and is somewhat subjective. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">(So far, this is an <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/design.htm\">argument from design</a>. Now observe the\nfurther step we can take in our thinking based on the question of presuppositions.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">A few minutes later, the second man (who believes the rocks were arranged by accident)\nsuggests that they should get out at the station and exchange their U. S. currency for\nCanadian money. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">\"What makes you think we should do that?\" asks the first man. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The second man answers, \"Can't you read?\" while pointing to the rocks on the\nhill \"It says we're entering Canada!\" </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">\"Okay, hold it right there!\" the first man says. \"You just claimed these\nrocks fell into this arrangement by pure chance, but now you're saying the arrangement of\nthe rocks means we are entering Canada!\" </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><b>The second man is acting in a way inconsistent with his own presuppositions</b>. By\nsuggesting they change their money, he has demonstrated that he, too, believes the\narrangement of the stones is no accident. His conclusion that they are entering Canada,\nbased on the arrangement of the stones, is inconsistent with his earlier claim that the\nstones had fallen into that pattern by accident. His actions and words demonstrate that\nhe, too, believes someone placed the stones in this arrangement on purpose in order to\ncommunicate something.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Applying the Illustration</h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Atheists, agnostics and other naturalists are inconsistent with their own\npresuppositions all the time, just like this man in the train. By learning to identify\nthose areas of inconsistency, we can help such people to see the strong likelihood that a\npersonal creator-God exists. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Let's examine a few examples of this inconsistency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Reason </h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Any time we use our reasoning ability to draw conclusions, and any time we look at\npatterns in the universe to discover truth (such as scientific laws) we are affirming by\nour actions that we already suppose there is a rational basis to the universe. Therefore,\nnaturalists (e.g. materialists or atheists) who use reason are being just as inconsistent\nas the man on the train. Let's see how this works. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">According to naturalists, everything in the universe is the result of chance and arose\nout of chaos. They see reality as a series of causes and effects, matter in collision with\nmatter and energy, reacting according to natural law. If this is true, then everything\nthat exists has been chemically <i>determined</i>. Chemicals and energy don't <i>decide </i>what\nto do when they collide. They do whatever the conditions and natural laws dictate. In\nother words, there is a cause and effect sequence in operation wherein each event has a\ngiven result. According to this naturalistic model, there can be no outside influence\n(like the human mind) that is not <i>also a part of this cause and effect chain</i>. What\nwe think are free thoughts on our part are really just chemical reactions in the synapses\nof our neurons, according to this naturalistic world view. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">If we, including our minds, are part of this cause and effect chain, all our thoughts\nand perceptions must be preconditioned by chemistry and physics. Why, then, would anyone\nwith this world view think his own thought processes (themselves conditioned) could tell\nhim anything about reality? Clearly, if we think our minds are not completely conditioned\nby natural law, we must presuppose the possibility that something non-material exists. We\nmust suppose the supernatural exists. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The fact that we use our reason to interpret reality, and the fact that we trust these\nconclusions also shows that we believe that there is an orderly and rational basis to the\nuniverse. Such reasoning, and such confidence in reason is consistent with <b>theism</b>\n(belief in an infinite personal God, like the God of the Bible), not with <b>naturalism </b>(the\nbelief that nothing exists but matter and energy). As theists, we argue that this\nreasonable and orderly basis behind the universe is none other than the reasoning and\npersonal one who created all, and is himself the ground of all being.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Freedom and Morality</h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">When we act as though we are free choosing beings, rather than determined ones, we\nimply that we believe there is a basis for freedom. Again, belief in personal freedom is\nonly consistent with theism, <i>never </i>with naturalism. As theists, we argue that this\nbasis is the eternally free and sovereignty choosing creator God who has made us in his\nimage. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The same goes for morality. Morality is impossible without free choice. Suppose I use a\nchain saw to sever someone's head from his body. When the police come, they arrest me, not\nthe chain saw, even though the chain saw actually did the cutting. Why shouldn't the chain\nsaw have to serve a prison sentence along with me? </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The answer is obvious. The chain saw is a machine, incapable of choice. It does\nwhatever I make it do. Therefore, we ignore the saw from the standpoint of morality and go\nthe first free-choosing being involved in the crime. Only when we are free to choose can\nwe be held responsible morally. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">People who accept that there is such a thing as morality must also <i>presuppose </i>a <i>personal\nbasis for morals</i>. But naturalists have no such basis in their world view. Ask\nyourself, \"Is it morally wrong to sexually abuse 3 year olds?\" \"Is this\npurely a personal moral preference, or is there a <i>universal </i>moral standard at\nstake?\" If such a moral is universal, and lies outside of the individual's decision\nto <b>make </b>it a moral, then there must be a basis. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Chemicals bumping into one another cannot teach us that child abuse is wrong, or that\nhuman life matters. Quite the contrary! If we are purely matter, and are the result of\nmaterial processes, then we are destined one day to perish as a race in the destruction of\nthe present solar system. If this is so, what difference does it make how that matter is\nconfigured in the meantime? Whether our molecules take one form (a living person) or\nanother (a decomposed body) could not be moral issue. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Neither could we explain why people are free under the naturalistic world view. If\npeople are nothing but matter, they must do what they do because they were <i>conditioned </i>to\ndo so. What other reason would there be? But if we were conditioned to do what we do, we\nare no more free in our choices than the chain saw. All morality disappears. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">In one area after another, we will find that it is impossible to act in such a way that\nwe are consistent with the world view of naturalism. Therefore this world-view fails the\ntest of internal consistency, and should be rejected by honest thinkers. Instead, we\nshould accept the fact that a personal moral and rational God has indeed created us and\nour world.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">When people realize their presuppositions don't match their conclusions, they often\nbecome open to new information. We have the information they need! The universe is\npersonal, moral, and free at it's core because its creator is personal, moral, and free.\nNotice that the presuppositional argument will not point to the pantheistic deities of the\neast. Only a personal and infinite God can account for what we see in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=presuppositions\">Ask\nDennis a question or share a comment.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/evang.htm\">Go to the Evangelism page</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/fms.htm\">Go to the Faith Makes Sense page</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Go to the Xenos page</a>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Presuppositions and the Existence of God","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/presup.htm"}

The directly revelatory part concerns the main purpose of the Scripture (to\n  make man wise unto salvation) and is inerrant. The facilitating parts are not inerrant and\n  are important only as a framing for the revelatory parts - therefore, they should not be\n  made to harmonize with science and history.2 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">This view is put forward in response to attacks on scientific and historical portions\nof the Bible. It is argued by some, that if only the \"spiritual\" parts are\ninspired, then the scientific and historical parts (which are most often questioned) do\nnot need to be defended in order to maintain the inspiration of Scripture. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Unfortunately, while such a view makes Scripture unrefutable, but it also makes it\nunverifiable, and open to the accusation that it contains only \"subjective\ntruth.\"3 The partial inerrancy position has been compared to the assertion that,\n\"UFO's exist, but they only appear when no one is around\". While this example is\nsomewhat disanalogous, it does serve to illustrate the fact that a position that cannot be\nfalsified, is not open to rational discussion. Stated differently, if the Bible is shown\nto be false in those areas that can be checked on, why should it be believed in the areas\nthat cannot be checked on (i.e. the spiritual parts)?4</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Partial Inerrantist Arguments</h3>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">Intentionalist vs. Correspondence Theories of Truth</h5>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The infallibility view argues that the Bible's view of truth is\n\"intentionalist\" rather than \"correspondence.\" This means a statement\nis true if it accomplishes its intended purpose, even if some of its factual assertions do\nnot correspond to reality. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">I would argue on the contrary, that the Bible's view of truth is the correspondence\nview.5 When the biblical authors do adopt an intentionalist approach, they indicate that\nthey are speaking in a parable by using appropriate parabolic language. It is unlikely\nthat unannounced parables are present in the text. </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">Church History</h5>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Another argument put forward by partial inerrantists is that the verbal plenary view of\ninspiration is not the historical view of the church. They claim the so-called verbal\nplenary view (or total inerrancy view) was the formulation of rationalistic Western\nthinking of late 19th century Fundamentalist theologians (Hodge, Warfield, &amp; friends)\nand therefore should not be equated with orthodoxy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Here we need to see that the more important issue is whether Jesus believed in verbal\nplenary inspiration, and (secondarily) whether the authors of Scripture believed in it.\nThe answer to these questions are affirmative.6 The view held by various periods of church\nhistory is of academic interest, but does not provide an adequate basis for faith. It is\ntoo easy to demonstrate error in the thinking of the church in history. </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">Accommodation</h5>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Another argument advanced by the partial inerrantists is that Jesus accommodated\nHimself to the 1st century Jewish view of inspiration, even though He did not personally\nbelieve in it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">This argument does not seem to be supportable. Jesus did not hesitate to differ with\nJewish beliefs that were wrong. We can quickly see in the Sermon on the Mount that Jesus\nwent directly after false beliefs of the day. Another striking example is the\nconfrontation with the clergy in Mt. 23. Why would Jesus become squeamish at the point of\nBiblical inerrancy? It would be difficult to claim that it is an unimportant issue.\nFurther, Jesus seems to go out of his way to affirm this teaching (which he supposedly\nknew was false, according to partial inerrantists). It seems impossible to draw any\nconclusion under the accommodation view other than that Jesus was lying. How many other\nfalse doctrines were ringingly affirmed by Christ for the sake of diplomacy? </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">Actual Apparent Errors</h5>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">There are a few obvious historical and scientific errors in the Bible.8 We do not have\nroom for a detailed response here. However, these can be answered by seeing that the\nerrors could be actually: \n</p><ul class=\"style1\">\n  <li>not errors at all (Mk. 10:45; Lk. 18:35) </li>\n  <li>copyist errors (II Chron. 22:2 is copyist error, see II Chron 21:20; see also II Kings\n    8:26 for the correct age) </li>\n  <li>a current lack of data, which, when corrected, will answer the problem just as it did in\n    the case of Dan. 5:31. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">Apparent Borrowing From Other Texts</h5>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">A final argument used against inerrancy is that parallels with pagan myth suggest\nborrowing or common sources. Again, without attempting to answer in detail, these\nparallels to myth may be explained in six other possible ways. \n</p><ul class=\"style1\">\n  <li>There may have been a common memory such as the case of the world flood. </li>\n  <li>The authenticity of many of the claimed parallels is debatable, as in the case of Gen. 1\n    and <i>Enuma Elish</i>. </li>\n  <li>The parallels may have been deliberate for the sake of communication and relevance.\n    (Deut. compared to 2nd millennia BC Hittite Suzerainty Treaties). </li>\n  <li>There may have been deliberate copying for sake of polemicizing (Ps. 74:12-14; Ps. 93). </li>\n  <li>There may have been borrowing because the statements borrowed were true (Proverbs). </li>\n  <li>Pagan sources may have borrowed from the Bible </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">These are the main directions we could go in defending the notion of inerrancy against\naccusations. We are left with the objections that I would raise against the partial view.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Why Reject Partial Inerrancy?</h3>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">History vs. Theology?</h5>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">In the first place, theology and history in Scripture cannot be meaningfully separated.\nHistory is often revelatory (for instance, the Exodus, the creation, the resurrection of\nChrist, etc.). </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Another question that must be raised is, \"Who determines which historical events\nare revelatory and which ones are not?\" Isn't the partial inerrantist simply\ntransferring to himself the very inerrancy that he denies to the Scriptures? </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">The Character of God</h5>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The partial view raises serious questions regarding the power and character of God.\nWhen God fails to communicate in both history and theology without error, is it because He\nis unable, or because He is unwilling? In either event, it seems that we have a problem. A\nGod unwilling to avoid error would be dishonest. A God unable to avoid error would be\nimpotent. </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">Other Points</h5>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">If the apostles can't be trusted to give accurate information about secular areas, why\nshould they be trusted in \"spiritual\" areas?9 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Jesus made no distinction between the historical and revelatory parts of the Old\nTestament in His quotation of it. He also quotes from Gen. 1-11 over 80 times.10 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The purpose of the Bible is \"to make man wise unto salvation\" and it is not a\nscientific or historical textbook. But it is also truthful in all areas that it affirms. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Thus I think that if we admit that there is sufficient warrant for believing that the\nBible is inspired, then that definition of inspiration should be understood to include\ntotal verbal inerrancy. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Endnotes</h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">1 It has also been called the partial inerrancy vs. total inerrancy debate. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">2 Montgomery, John Warwick, <i>God's Inerrant Word</i>, p.24, (Bethany Fellowship Inc.,\nMinneapolis, Minn.,1973) quoting Daniel P. Fuller's article \"The Nature Of Biblical\nInerrancy,\" in the <i>American Scientific Affiliation Journal</i>.XXIV/2 (June\n1972)p.50. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">3 In other words, truth that may not correspond to the real world, and/or is not\nsubject to the laws of reason. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">4 The infallibility position would argue that the inerrantist's appeal to the\nautographs is subject to the same criticism. However, there is a difference, because the\nclaim that an accurate standard used to exist is quite different from the position that\nthere has never been such a standard. The original existence of an inerrant text bears\nheavily on the whole theology of revelation including the reliability of the imperfect\ntexts that we now have. See Harris's illustration of the stolen yard bar. Harris, R.\nLaird, <i>The Inspiration and Canonicity of the Bible</i>, (Zondervan Publishing House,\nGrand Rapids, MI 1957,1969) pp.88,89 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">5 See Ex. 20:16; Jn. 8:44 with reference to Gen. 3:4; 2:17; Acts 5:1-4; Gen. 42:16; I\nKings 22:16-22; Ps. 119:163; Jn. 5:33; Acts 24:8,11; Lev. 4:2,27. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">6. See a short outline including Jesus' teachings on inspiration in Verbal Plenary\nInspiration, by Dennis McCallum and Gary DeLashmutt. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">7 The authors of Scripture are unambiguous in their claims to inspiration. These\nclaims, if not true, would discredit completely any other claims they made. Old Testament\nAuthors: Josh. 1:8; 22:5; II Sam. 23:2; Heb. 9:3,30; Neh. 10:29 New Testament Authors: I\nCor.14:37; II Pet. 3:2; II Pet. 1:16-21; Rev. 1:3; Rev. 22:18,19; I_Tim._5:18; I Thess.\n2:13,15; II Pet.3:15,16; Gal.1:11-12; Jn. 21:24; II Tim. 3:16 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">8 For instance, II Kings 8:26 compared to II Chron. 22:2. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">9 This is exactly Paul's question in I Cor. 15:15. Although the resurrection was an\nhistorical event, Paul felt that inaccuracy in that area discredited all of his testimony\nin other areas. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">10He made no distinction between the historicity of the first eleven chapters and the\nother chapters in Genesis. See Mt. 19:4,6; 24:38; Lk. 17:32; 11:30 for examples.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=the%20extent\">Ask\nDennis a question or share a comment.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\">Back to the Essays page</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Back to Xenos home page</a>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Extent and Nature of Inspiration","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/innernt.htm"}

His\nzeal was so intense that it might well have been considered fanaticism in our culture. On\nthe positive side, his zeal no doubt was an important element in his ability to lead and\npersuade others. On the negative side, he tended to lack patience, driving himself to the\npoint of physical collapse on several occasions.36 He lived in self-imposed poverty. </p>\n\n<h5>Idealism </h5>\n\n<p>Nee was not only idealistic, he was hyper- idealistic. The word \"compromise\"\nwas not in his vocabulary. Cliff points out that he bitterly denounced the western\nmissionary churches because, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\". . . (he) found the Christians of the missionary societies' churches\n  half-hearted and compromising, and charged that the denominations were weighted down with\n  what was to him man-made traditions regarding baptism, worship and ordination, teaching\n  what was quite foreign to what he read in the New Testament.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and again, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Convinced of the rightness of his unstructured assembly, free from denominational\n  traditions, he asserted, `Those who really want to live entirely in accordance with the\n  Lord's truth will know real freedom in our midst.'\"37 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nee considered the western form of church life (especially the existence of\ndenominations) \"an affront to God\".38 He berated western missionaries for\nshamelessly asking for money for themselves.39 He deplored the clergy/laity distinction\nthat was so strong in western Christianity.40 \"While the responsibility of expanding\nthe work of the Church lay chiefly, if not solely on the shoulder of the pastor in the\nother denominational churches, Nee concentrated on training all the believers to do the\nwork of God.\"41 </p>\n\n<p>Thus Nee manifests himself as a purist in terms of primitive biblical Christianity.\nInterestingly, Cliff points out that a number of western missionaries agreed with Nee's\ncriticisms, and forsook the agencies that had sent them in order to work with Nee.42 This\ndid not earn Nee any popularity with western churches. </p>\n\n<p>Another aspect of the same purism was his refusal to become a part of the popular\nnationalism that was dominating China at the time. During the war with Japan, he refused\nto pray that China or Japan would win. \"It must be possible,\" he said in 1940,\n\"for British and German, Chinese and Japanese Christians to kneel and pray together.\n. . in China, Christians and Missionaries have too much intimacy with the state. . . we\nask for neither a Chinese nor a Japanese victory, but for whatever is of advantage. . . to\nThee. . . \"43 This remarkable excerpt from a war-time sermon was not what the average\nChinese wanted to hear! </p>\n\n<p>In another area, Nee argued that Christian workers should not only refrain from asking\nothers for money for their own ministry, but that they should also not give any indication\nof need whether verbally or otherwise.44 </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, like so many purists, Nee's meticulous insistence on even the smallest\ndetail sometimes resulted in a violation of a major ethical imperative. Nee's idealism was\none of his greatest strengths, but without prioritization, it also became a weakness.45 </p>\n\n<h5>Studious:</h5>\n\n<p>Nee is repeatedly characterized by those who knew him as a profound student of the\nScriptures. He demonstrates knowledge of the Greek text in his writings, although it is\nnot clear to me whether he was versed in Greek or depended on other authorities.46 </p>\n\n<p>Kinnear comments on Nee's preaching, that no one ever saw him use any notes, for he\nremembered and could reproduce anything he read.\"47 After visiting Shanghai Charles\nBarlow commented: </p>\n\n<p>Some of these dear brethren are very sincere and thirsting for truth. Watchman Nee is\nundoubtedly the outstanding man among them. He is far beyond all the rest. He is only 28,\nbut has had a good education and is possessed of marked ability. He is a hard worker and\nreads much. . . 48 </p>\n\n<p>Witness Lee said of Nee, \"I have never met a man so well-versed in the Scriptures\nas he.\"49 Noted Chinese evangelist John Sung said, \"For exposition of the\nScriptures, I am not equal to Watchman Nee.\"50 Therefore, like so many great figures\nin the history of the church, Nee had powerful intellectual gifts that were well\ndeveloped, as well as a love of God's Word. </p>\n\n<p>When this evidence is considered, it may seem surprising that Nee is sometimes\nconsidered anti-intellectual by western readers. This conclusion stems from his\nmystical-fideistic bent which was suspicious of autonomous reason. His very early magazine\ncarried the statement of purpose, \"The fostering and cultivation of the spiritual\nlife, with no attempt to debate rationally.\" This position seems to have softened in\nlater life, with better education.51 </p>\n\n<h5>Activistism:</h5>\n\n<p>Although Nee's works have been rightly criticized for \"superspirituality\",\n(falsely dichotomizing Christian good works and spirituality) his own life does not seem\nto have been plagued by introspective paralysis. Some later readers of books attributed to\nNee have complained that he calls for so much concern over whether an action is\n\"soulish\" or \"spiritual\" apart from whether it is ethical, that he\nbecomes very de-motivating, and deflating. A careful reader of Nee has no difficulty\nidentifying faulty statements in this area. However, it is interesting to note that Nee's\nlife and that of his immediate hearers was characterized by almost constant action.52</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee5.htm\" target=\"cright\">Read on to the next section of Nee and the House\nChurch Movement</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=wathman\">Ask Dennis a\nquestion or share a comment.</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Go back to the Essays page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/chhist.htm\" target=\"_top\">Go back to the Church History page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Go back to the Xenos home page</a> \n</p>\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Watchman Nee Section IV","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/nee4.htm"}

Outward forms can refer to: \n</p><ul class=\"style1\">\n  <li>the sacred buildings or shrines in which worship occurs </li>\n  <li>the calendar of sacred days and times around which religious life is oriented </li>\n  <li>the rituals through which followers can experience the sacred or be fixed in some way </li>\n  <li>special dress, diet, language, or other behaviors unique to that religion </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Why Not?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Formalism is found the world over in all religions. It is also common in historical\nChristianity, but is roundly condemned in the Bible, both in Old and New Testaments.\nFormalism is an impersonal outlook which misses the point where the things of God are\nconcerned. It diverts people's attention and affections from the important to the\nunimportant--from the wine to the wineskins. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">At Xenos, we have developed a thorough critique of formalism, which we believe lies at\nthe root of many of the problems in contemporary Christianity. You can see material on\nformalism in several places on this site: </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/objct_a.htm\">The Objectification of Religion</a> is a research paper on one\naspect of formalism; sacred space. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/formpray.htm\">Formalism in Prayer</a> is adapted from Senior Pastor, <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/personal/den.htm\">Dennis McCallum</a>'s book, <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/wiv.htm\"><i>Walking\nin Victory</i></a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/um1-1.htm\">The Relation of the Church to the Old Testament</a> is a\ntraining guide for a class on ecclesiology. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/stvn_a.htm\">Strange Details in Stephen's Defense</a> is a study of \n  Acts 7 highlighting how Stephen attacked formalism. <br>\n  <br>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Contact Dennis with a comment\nor question</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/minteam.htm\">Return to the Ministry Team page</a> </p>\n\n<p><span class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to the Xenos home page</a></span> </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Formalism: What Is It, and Why Not?","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/frmlism.htm"}

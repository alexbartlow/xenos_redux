But what I am\nconcerned with is the Bible's view of itself. We could look at this question from the\nperspective of each author or each segment of scripture and ask how the Torah views its\nauthoritativeness, and alternately then the Prophets, the Writings, the Gospels, etc.,\nuntil we put together a comprehensive view on the scripture's attestation of its own\nauthority. </p>\n\n<p>But as this  task would be far beyond the scope of this paper, I will\nadopt a shorter route. Probably the most fruitful and concise way to examine the\nScripture's view of itself is through the words of Christ. As he is God's revelation,\nGod's Word, which has come to us in human form, he has the greatest potential to shed\nlight on the entirety of Scripture. In Christ we have the references to God's past\nrevelation (still current and operative), God's present revelation in Christ's person and\nwords, and what would be His future revelation through the disciples. What I am proposing\nis that Christ's view on the authority of the biblical text is paradigmatic of the\nScripture's view of itself.</p>\n\n<p>In taking this approach at least one potential objection may be raised against it and\nit is best to deal with this up front. That objection is the charge of circular reasoning,\nthat is that we are using the Scripture's own testimony to support itself. In other words,\nwhat Christ says about the Scripture is contained within the Scripture itself. There are\nno external witnesses to corroborate Christ's words and therefore we are left with the\nBible affirming its own truthfulness.</p>\n\n<p>In order to deal with this criticism we need to establish the text's reliability as a\nwitness before proceeding to demonstrate Christ's views regarding his authority or the\nauthority of past or future revelation. If the text shows itself to be reliable in matters\nof history including statements of fact as well as geography, etc., then we may conclude\nthat it is a reliable source regarding other matters that it affirms (See my paper\nentitled Doubting.doc for a more complete argument regarding the reliability of the text.)\nFor time's sake and to avoid duplication we can affirm that the text is indeed a reliable\nwitness. And because it is a reliable witness we may reasonably conclude that it\nrepresents Christ's words faithfully. Therefore, let us examine what He has said. </p>\n\n<p>What is immediately apparent upon reading Jesus' references to Scripture is that He\nquotes it in a variety of ways referring to the author at times or making general\nallusions to the past or broadly affirming its character. In all of the manners and ways\nin which He communicates regarding the Scripture, His high views of it are apparent. For\nour purposes, Christ's handling of Scripture can be divided into three types of usage:\nreferences, quotations, and direct affirmations. In His references to Scripture He\ndirectly or indirectly lends authority to an event such as Moses' writing of the law or\nthe factual nature of Noah's experiences. In quotations of Scripture, Christ submits to\nits authority and bestows on it His approval in numerous ways including the well known\nformula \"it is written.\" Although less frequent, though no less important, are\nChrist's direct affirmations to the Scripture's veracity. But while these are important,\nwhat is more telling as to Christ's view of the Scripture, is His casual use of Scripture.\nEven without His direct attestation to it, His views regarding Scripture are apparent. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>References to Scripture</h3>\n\n<p>Christ makes use of two kinds of references to Scripture apart from directly quoting\nit: references of fact and indirect references. In the former Christ assumes the\nhistoricity of the event, lending to it His authority as if to say, \"this actually\nhappened.\" Examples of this kind of reference are numerous. \"I tell you the\ntruth, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of\njudgment, than for that city\" (Mtt 10:15). In this statement Christ lends His\nauthority both to the factual existence of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, and their\njudgment, as well as the biblical teaching of a judgment yet to come. Likewise,\nregarding Noah and the events of his life, \"For the coming of the Son of Man will be\njust like the days of Noah. For as in those days which were before the flood they were\neating and drinking they were marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah\nentered the ark . . . (Mtt 24:36ff). Christ maintains that there was a person in history\nnamed Noah who lived and whose existence follows a chronology preceding and postdating a\ncataclysmic earth wide flood.</p>\n\n<p>Christ repeatedly refers to events, not as stories being told in order to illustrate a\npoint (as He does with parables e.g., <i>omoioV estin</i>), but as factual historical\nevents. \"There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah. . . . there were\nmany lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha. . . (Lk 4:25ff.). He refers to Jonah and the\nactual people of Nineveh who lived and died there. He refers to Lot and the wicked city in\nwhich he lived, as well as to many other historical persons and events. Christ affirms\nthat Scripture is accurate as an historical document and what it teaches are not stories\nbut historical events.</p>\n\n<p>Christ lends his authority to biblical authorship as well by other references of fact.\nHe makes statements such as, \"in the book of Moses\" (Mrk12:26), \"David\nsaid\" (Mrk 12:36), \"spoken through Daniel the prophet\" (Mtt 24:15). While\nit is certainly possible to argue that Christ lends His authority only to those passages\nwhich he actually cites, or that He spoke to accommodate Himself to the reader, to do this\nis to read into the text. It is to enforce an artificial interpretation on the natural\nreading, an interpretation which is beyond demonstration. The most natural,\nstraightforward reading is that Christ believed and affirmed that these books were indeed\nwritten by these men. </p>\n\n<p>Christ indirectly references Scripture, as well. Some of these passages give powerful\ninsight into Christ's beliefs for the very reason that they are not His direct teachings\nregarding Scriptures. What they reveal are more foundational, that is, His assumptions\nregarding Scripture.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/inerrcy.htm#Footnote1B\" name=\"Footnote1A\">Footnote1</a>\n\"The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses;\ntherefore all that they tell you, do and observe, but do not do according the their deeds;\nfor they say things, and do not do them\" (Mtt 23:2,3). Christ is indicating that the\nlaw of Moses is binding regardless of who teaches it. The \"chair of Moses\" is\nauthoritative for life and not subject to the attestations of men, for the very reason, as\nwe shall see, that there is a difference between men's teachings and traditions and God's\ntruth. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Mark 7:8,9. In the context of quoting an Old\nTestament passage Christ says, \"Neglecting the commandment of God, you hold to the\ntradition of men. . . You nicely set aside the commandment of God in order to keep your\ntradition.\" Christ draws a sharp distinction here between the words of men,\npresumably the Talmud and various other traditions, and the words of God. The words of men\nare not binding on mankind, in fact they are to be subservient to God's commandments. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Quotations from Scripture</h3>\n\n<p>And what are God's commandments? Here we move out of Christ's indirect references to\nScripture and into direct quotations, specifically, those in which the author of Scripture\nis spoken of interchangeably with God. Christ continues in the very next verse of Mark,\n\"For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother. . .'\" The words of God are\nthe words of Moses, and Isaiah (quoted by Christ in the preceding verses Mark 7:6,7), and\nthe rest of the Old Testament Scriptures. Christ does not ascribe these words to a human\nauthor as though they were human and therefore less binding. Another instance of a similar\nkind occurs in Matthew 19: 4-5. \"The Creator said, 'For this reason a man will leave\nhis father and mother.\" Christ attributes Moses' words, the author of Genesis, as\nbelonging to \"the Creator.\" In citing Moses' words He ascribes them to the very\nwords of God, their real author.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/inerrcy.htm#Footnote2B\" name=\"Footnote2A\">Footnote2</a>\nSomehow God has worked through Moses and Isaiah to produce words that are God's very own\nas Christ calls them \"the commandment of God.\" What greater attestation could we\nhave from Christ than to equate Scripture with God's words, to equate writings of human\ninstrumentality with divine actuality.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/inerrcy.htm#Footnote3B\" name=\"Footnote3A\">Footnote3</a></p>\n\n<p>Christ quotes the Scriptures in many other ways. He uses quotations to attest to His\nministry, to clarify truth, to demonstrate prophetic fulfillment, as well as to\ndemonstrate its binding nature as in the use of the phrase \"it is written.\"\nScripture is a foundational part of Jesus' ministry as He demonstrates by His reliance\nupon and usage of Scripture. In every phase of His life and ministry He showed a complete\nreliance on Scripture. Never correcting it or overruling it but rather clarifying Jewish\ninterpretation of it and thereby affirming His commitment to it.</p>\n\n<p>Christ also uses the Scriptures as an attestation of truth. While this may be an all\ntoo obvious usage, it is necessary to call attention to it in order to see the importance\nof Scriptures in Jesus' ministry. When the Jews misunderstood something or emphasized one\nprinciple to the detriment of another Christ valued the truth of Scriptures enough to\ncorrect their misunderstanding because their use of the holy writ was not simply a\nreligious exercise but a matter of utmost importance. Thus Christ quotes Hosea 6:6 \"I\ndesire compassion, and not sacrifice,\" to correct their rigid view of the Sabbath.\nHad Christ not viewed this as an issue of ultimate importance and relevance, He could have\noverlooked it. But it was a misunderstanding that dealt with the Scriptures and their view\nof God and He could not overlook this. Their traditions, men's words, had overridden the\nScripture, God's words. And therefore Jewish teachings had corrupted their understanding\nof who God was. And this is what Christ challenged referring them back to Scripture as the\nfinal court of appeal to correct their false views of God.</p>\n\n<p>He also attests to the Scripture's ability to provide the truth necessary for\nsalvation. The Scriptures' so thoroughly attest to the truth of God that they are\nsufficient for salvation. Christ responds to the lawyer in Luke 10:25 who asks what he\nmust do to inherit eternal life, after quoting from the law Christ responds to him,\n\"You have answered correctly; Do this, and you will live.\" If understood and\napplied correctly the Scriptures are necessary and adequate for salvation. It is difficult\nto overstate this point. That is, the Scriptures are so thoroughly God's word, as we have\npreviously seen, not just the words of men, and in that they are God's word they are able\nto bring men to Him. They provide a right perspective of God as well as a right\nperspective of men and therefore dictate the terms by which one can approach the other.</p>\n\n<p>The Scriptures' ability to provide salvation find their fulfillment in Christ, for they\nbear witness to Him. This is another of the means by which Jesus uses the Scriptures, as\nthey relate to fulfilled prophecy. He is careful to draw His listeners back to the\nauthoritative word. Christ begins his ministry in the gospel of Luke by reading from\nIsaiah 61. Upon completing his reading of the text he declares, \"Today this Scripture\nhas been fulfilled in your hearing\" (Lk 4:21). </p>\n\n<p>He places a great amount of emphasis on the fulfillment of Scripture in order to\ndemonstrate and affirm its veracity. In referring to His deliverance to the authorities He\nclaims, \"But all this has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets may be\nfulfilled\" (Mtt 26:56). And again, \"These are My words which I spoke to you\nwhile I was still with you, that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses\nand the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled\" (Lk 24:44). He affirms that the\nScriptures are true and must happen as they so declare. God's will as recorded in\nScripture is not subject to the will of man. The words are true and God will intervene to\nbring them to pass. God is bound, not by the words of men, but by His own words, His own\npromises.</p>\n\n<p>However, it is not just that Christ attests to Scripture's truth in prophetic\nfulfillment, but that the Scriptures attest to Him. In fact he rests His authority on the\nveracity of prophetic Scripture. \"For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me;\nfor he wrote of Me. But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My\nwords?\" (John 5:46ff.). Christ is willing to stake His ministry and His character on\nthe truthfulness of Scripture. </p>\n\n<p>This point cannot be overlooked. If the Scriptures are in error, how can they attest to\none who is without error? If the Scriptures are fallible, then in what way can we depend\non them to attest to Christ? Without question God uses fallible human means to attest to\nHis infallibility, but never does God tie His infallibility to humans in the way in which\nChrist ties His truthfulness to that of the Scriptures. If the Bible is in error, then\nsurely Christ cannot be trusted. This may not be a position we would want to place Christ\nin, but it is the position in which He puts Himself.</p>\n\n<p>An accurate demonstration of Christ's reliance upon Scripture is given in each of the\nsynoptic gospels upon Christ's death. According to the synoptic gospels, the last words\nout of Jesus' mouth before His death are words from the Scripture. Mark and Matthew show\nHim quoting Psalm 22, \"My God, My God, why Hast Thou forsaken me?\" (Mtt 27:46,\nMrk 15:34). Luke demonstrates the same idea, \"Into Thy hands I commit my spirit\"\n(Lk 23:56). With Matthew and Mark, and possibly Luke, the Scriptures He quotes are\nprophetic. Until His last breath Jesus is pointing to the truthfulness of the Scriptures\nto demonstrate that His character and ministry are from God and not from man just as the\nScriptures are God's words and not man's.</p>\n\n<p>Another way in which God's word is quoted by Christ as such is in the use of the\nformula \"it is written.\" This formula appears 39 times in the gospels, 26 of\nthose are from the mouth of Christ. He uses this phrase as an ultimate appeal to\nauthority. When the Jews could not believe that their \"vineyard\" might be given\nto another, Christ appeals to the Scripture. \"What then is this that <i>is written</i>,\n'The stone which the builders rejected, this became the chief corner stone?'\" (Lk\n20:17). Jesus shows that He accepts as authoritative everything that \"is\nwritten,\" including His own suffering. \"For I tell you, that which <i>is written</i>\nmust be fulfilled in Me, 'And he was numbered with transgressors'; for that which refers\nto Me has its fulfillment\" (Lk 22:37). </p>\n\n<p>Of the \"it is written\" formulaic passages probably the most important are\nthose occurring in the beginning of Matthew and Luke in the temptation narratives. While\nChrist is being tempted by the devil in the wilderness a battle takes place and the\nweapons of warfare used by Christ, and the devil, are the Scriptures. Jesus is shown as\nbeing tempted three times: to satisfy His needs, to prove His identity, and to gain power.\nIn all three situations he responds by quoting Scripture beginning with the formula\n\"it is written.\" What is significant here is that instead of battling Satan\nbased on His own authority, which He could have done, He rests His authority on the\nbiblical writings. Jesus demonstrates His utter dependence on the truthfulness of the\nwritten word. \"It is written\" is the ultimate appeal to authority. Its\nequivalent is \"God said\" or \"thus saith the Lord.\" This is the power\nChrist rests on and this is the power that silences His adversary. For Christ, and even\nSatan, \"it is written\" is the last word for it demonstrates the authority of\nGod.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Direct Affirmations of Scripture</h3>\n\n<p>The last aspect of Christ's teaching to be examined is His direct affirmations of\nScripture. In this section I am including His attestations to the Old Testament as well as\nHis attestation of His own words. In Luke 16:17 we hear Christ speak these words,\n\"But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter\nof the Law to fail.\" God's truthfulness in the written word will last longer than the\nheavens and earth. This remarkable statement certainly appears to indicate that Christ\nvalued every detail of written Scripture as true. Notice that Christ does not appeal to\nthe \"word of God\" language that might have protected Him from affirming the\nauthority of potentially corrupted written texts. He affirms that not one \"stroke of\na letter\" will fail.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/inerrcy.htm#Footnote4B\" name=\"Footnote4A\">Footnote4</a>\nHe immediately applies this by adding that divorce is wrong. Man's traditions cannot\noverride God's written word from the most minute to the most essential issues.</p>\n\n<p>Matthew witnesses to Christ's unbending commitment to the written word in the same\nmanner. \"Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come\nto abolish, but to fulfill. For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not\nthe smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law, until all is\naccomplished\" (Mtt 5:17,18). Later in Matthew's gospel Jesus demonstrates just how\nseriously He takes this statement. In correcting the Sadducees' view of the resurrection,\nJesus bases His argument on the tense of one verb, \"'I <i>am</i> the God of Abraham,\nand the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' He is not the God of the dead but of the\nliving\" (Mtt 22:32). Christ affirms the Scriptures as accurate down to the verb\ntenses.</p>\n\n<p>As with the written word of God, Christ maintains that His words are good for\nsalvation, they will not pass away, and they are equal to the Father's words. While His\nwords were not canonical at the time that He spoke them, it is worth briefly noting their\nrelationship to His teaching on the canonical Scriptures. \"Heaven and earth will pass\naway, but My words shall not pass away\" (Mtt 24:35, Lk 21:33). In saying this Christ\nmaintains that His words will survive, presumably also in written form, and that they are\nvirtually the same as the rest of the written Scriptures. This view is buttressed by John\n14:23, 24. \"If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him,\nand We will come to him, and make Our abode with him. He who does not love Me does not\nkeep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father's who sent\nMe.\" God's words are recorded in the Old Testament scriptures and they are also\nspoken through Jesus. </p>\n\n<p>The question as to the truthfulness, infallibility, inerrancy of the Scriptures comes\nto rest on the person of Jesus Christ. Who is Christ? Who we decide Christ to be will\ndetermine what we decide about the Scriptures. If Christ is God, all knowing and all\nloving then we can come to no other conclusion than His own. The written word is truthful\nin every stroke of every letter. If however Christ is not God or not loving and truthful,\nthen we can believe what we will regarding the Scriptures. What we cannot do, in order to\nremain true to Christ and the Bible, is to mingle these views. We cannot legitimately hold\nto Christ's divinity and veracity while holding to fallible Scriptures. The authority of\nboth are intimately tied together, not by our logic but by Christ's own words. One basing\nHis authority on the other, the other attesting to the authority of the One. We cannot\nhold for a fallible Scripture and an infallible Christ, just as it would be ludicrous to\nhold for an infallible Scripture and a fallible Christ. Each attests to the other and we\nmust decide what to do with them both, for they present themselves as a package. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bibliography</h3>\n\n<p>Erickson, Millard J. \"The Dependability of God's Word: Inerrancy.\" Chapter in\n<i>Christian Theology</i>.

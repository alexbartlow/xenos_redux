Some of these explanations seem to carry more weight than\nothers. It would not be correct, in my view, to record and analyze these explanations\nwithout also adding the Christian perspective held by myself. </p>\n\n<p>The suggestion made by Norbeck, Davies, Warnac and others that people are unresponsive\nto the abstract, and need something concrete to relate their faith to, is no doubt true to\nsome extent. It seems that some objectified features are appropriate for most people,\nbecause God himself included objectified elements in the Bible. </p>\n\n<p>The Old Testament is rife with classic structures of objectification, ranging from\nstrictly delineated sacred space in the temple, to a detailed cultus surrounding that\nspace. </p>\n\n<p>It is interesting to note that in the New Testament, we find this level of\nobjectification radically truncated, though still not eliminated altogether. There is\nabsolutely no provision in the New Testament Era (which I take to have begun at Pentecost)\nfor any form of sacred space. The provision for sacred space in the Old Testament is\nreinterpreted by Paul, Christ, Peter, and the author of Hebrews to correspond to the\nassembly of true believers in Christ.47 The early Christians may have continued to relate\nto the temple for some time, although this is condemned in Hebrews and elsewhere.48\nLikewise, there was no claim made in the area of sacred time, or a religious calendar.49\nPriesthood was attributed first to Christ, and secondarily, to all believers, making\nformal priesthood obsolete.50 </p>\n\n<p>There were two specific features to New Testament Christianity that suggest\nobjectification-- water baptism, and the Lord's Supper.51 </p>\n\n<p>We could speculate on the likelihood that God may have provided objectified forms in\nthe Old Testament period because He realized that the people at that time would not stay\nwith any religion that did not have such structures. Therefore, the sacred space and the\ncultus served the purposes of providing a point of unity for the nation, teaching\nspiritual truths (many about Christ), and providing a tangible expression for a people who\nwould not have been willing or able to maintain their spiritual identity without such\nstructures. We already know that God was prepared to speak to the people in their own\nhistorical terms, as demonstrated by the relationship of the Deuteronomic code to Hittite\nsuzerainty treaties.52 </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, at the time of Pentecost, the universal indwelling of the Holy\nSpirit would enable the people to remain faithful, and would provide a more personal\navenue of relationship. God therefore dispensed with the \"shadows\" or\n\"elemental things\" that had served as a tutor before.53 Yet even at that time,\nsome objectification was allowed, for the sake of the special kind of fellowship that is\npossible through these ordinances. As Warnac observes, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The two worlds of God and man, heaven and earth, spirit and matter meet\n  preeminently in the religious symbol. Even the etymology of symbolon, from symballein (to\n  cast together), suggests this.\"54 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While recognizing the value of symbols, the Christian historian is also acutely aware\nof the spiritual dangers of objectification. </p>\n\n<p>Even in the Old Testament period, there was a tendency to look to the symbols\nthemselves, rather than to the reality they expressed. As Brow points out, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"...the prophets constantly had to fight priestly rapacity and the misconceptions\n  of the people. Where there were no prophets, priesthood and temple worship always\n  degenerated into the ugliness of priestcraft.\"55 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Likewise Norbeck, speaking from an entirely secular perspective says,\"...religious\nacts tend to become goals in themselves. Histories of religions provide many examples of\nrituals rendered meaningless by the passage of time but which are nevertheless tenaciously\nretained. Empty of their original significance, the rites themselves have become goals\nwhich the members of society are under compulsion to reach by faithful\nperformance.\"56 </p>\n\n<p>Therefore we must conclude that from the Christian perspective, there are benefits and\ndangers in objectification. Because of this, it would be perilous to introduce new\nfeatures of objectification which are not authorized in the Bible, without carefully and\nrepeatedly differentiating between the wine and the wineskins.57 </p>\n\n<p>What then should we conclude regarding the \"unresponsiveness to the abstract\"\nthesis advanced by Norbeck, Davies and Warnac? To this I answer that, in my view, such an\nexplanation is suspect. It is too easy to assert that the \"great unwashed\nmasses\" are not as smart as we are. On the contrary, there is frequent response to\nthe abstract on the part of common folk both now, and at various times throughout history.\nThe New Testament is very lean on objectification, and long on abstract truths. Yet, the\nauthors address their letters to the rank and file of the church, not just to the\nleadership.58 Also, substantial history in the Christian church demonstrates that this\nkind of thinking has led to the disenfranchisement of the laity from ministry, and from\naccess to the Scriptures. The thinking that says, \"They can't understand the\nScriptures, so let us give them a picture of Jesus to relate to...\" is foreign to the\nNew Testament. </p>\n\n<p>This position was taken by the leadership in the early church, either because it was\nthe easy way out, (in that it spared the clergy from the burden of educating their people)\nor as Brow, Schmidt, and Richardson claim, because it led to personal gain on the part of\na corrupt clergy. </p>\n\n<p>The latter position cannot be ruled out, in my view, by anyone who believes in the\nbiblical doctrine of the depravity of all mankind. Behavior that benefits oneself is\nalways tempting, and anyone who has experience in church ministry knows the urge to take\nover and \"do it myself.\" </p>\n\n<p>Certainly, the overall effect of objectification has been to create and sustain an\nintermediary role for the clergy that precludes lay initiative in the vital areas of\nspiritual life. </p>\n\n<p>For these reasons, I think the \"corruption of religion\" theory is a\nworthwhile contribution to our understanding of objectification, especially if we remember\nthat these urges are very subtle in the minds of the various clergies, and that the\nchanges that benefited them were very slow in developing. Later clergy, on the other hand,\ncould look at a long tradition of objectification which tended to sustain itself. </p>\n\n<p>Eliade, who was influenced by the German scholar Walter F. Otto, and who in turn is a\nclear and major influence on Carmody and Carmody, has a unique empathy for the religious\nmentality. His reflections on sacred space are useful, as noted earlier. At the same time,\nthese authors, with their postmodern acceptance of the validity of all religious forms,\nend up negating the truth claims of Christianity, not to mention the logical law of\nnon-contradiction. </p>\n\n<p>We can understand and sympathize with other religious outlooks while refusing to put\nall truth claims on the same level, namely that of relativity to the individual's\nexperience. While not questioning the sincerity of religious experience for the\nindividuals involved, as Christians, we are unable to affirm that a mere sense of the\n\"sacred\" is a sufficient basis for credibility. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Assessing Religious Experience</h3>\n\n<p>At this point the Christian student of religion is confronted by a fascinating\nquestion. Namely, if all religious expressions are not encountering the God of the Bible,\nwhat are they encountering, and why is it so similar to objectified Christianity? </p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that we have to again look to some universal feature of humankind, or of\nthe cosmos, to account for such a universal existence of these kinds of forms. </p>\n\n<p>This is where the \"Magical Elements\" theory seems to offer a link. Since\nmagic is what Frazer has called, \"the truly universal creed\", found everywhere\nand at all times, and the great religions have tended toward strikingly similar forms, the\nlikelihood of this explanation seems very strong. It would definitely be a mistake to\nlimit our concept of magic to the more flagrant or obvious manifestations, and fail to see\nwhat Norbeck has indicated, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Supernaturalistic ideas of sympathy extend over a tremendous range, far exceeding\n  that of mere initiation or of contagion from direct contact. Ideas of affinity may be\n  applied to any objects...\"59 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We have noted numerous signs of magical outlooks in objectified religion, ranging from\ncontainment of the sacred, to outright exuvial magic. I find myself unable to avoid the\nconclusion that humankind's craving for control and regularization of the sacred has\nplayed a major role in the objectification of religion. </p>\n\n<p>Here lies the greatest danger in excessive objectification. Magic is an impersonal and\nmechanistic way to relate to God. It is interesting to note that, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"In many primitive societies confession and prayers beseeching forgiveness for\n  sins or aid in maintaining moral standards are both unknown and unthinkable.\"60 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Instead, we find the bare attempt to manipulate the supernatural, or at least to avoid\ntrouble with it. Such a relationship is analogous to most people's relationship to the\nInternal Revenue Service. It is a legalistic relationship where we do the least we can in\norder to stay out of trouble. There is certainly no personal love aspect to such a\nrelationship.61 </p>\n\n<p>While some sorts of magical notions may account for objectification when considered\nfrom the viewpoint of the practitioner, this does not exclude the \"Cognitive\nRestructuring\" explanation cited above. While this process would have no place\nwhatsoever in the mind of the worshipers, it may well answer the question posed above\nregarding what religionists are experiencing, if not the God of the Bible.62 This theory\naccounts for many hard to understand features of objectified religion using phenomena that\ncan be demonstrated in a psychologist's laboratory. It has appeal because of this\nsimplicity. Part, if not all of this process is likely to be operative in most ritualism. </p>\n\n<p>Taken together then, these explanations form a framework that accounts, in my mind, for\nmost types of objectification of religion. At the same time, it is easier to understand\nthe reasons for the trend observable in the Bible away from objectification, and toward\nthe personal and the abstract-- a tendency that will continue into the future, </p>\n\n<p>\"I saw no temple in it, for the Lord, the Almighty, and the Lamb are its\ntemple.\"63</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Ask Dennis a\nquestion or share a comment.</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/objct_a.htm\">Go back to the Objectification table of contents</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\">Go back to the Essays page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/objct6.htm\">Browse the Bibliography and Endnotes for\n\"Objectification\"</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Go back to the Xenos home page</a> </p>\n\n<p>Send Dennis a comment or question  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Objectification Of Religion:\nUniversal Themes V","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/objct5.htm"}

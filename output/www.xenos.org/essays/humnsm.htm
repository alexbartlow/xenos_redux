It is possible to espouse\ntheistic humanism, or even Christian Humanism. In these cases, the term humanism means a\nconcern for humanistic goals, with the understanding that God is the final solution to\nman's needs. Secular humanism, on the other hand, implies a focus on man apart from God,\nwhether or not God exists.</p>\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Recognizing Secular Humanism</h3>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">The following statements are drawn from the Humanist Manifesto I written in 1933.\nSigned by many of the leading atheistic scholars of that day, it was the benchmark test\nfor so-called \"religious humanism\" up until 1973, and continues to embody many\nof the key values of this world view.</h5>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>\"Humanism believes that man is a part of nature and that he has emerged \n    as the result of a continuous process.\" </p>\n  <p>\"Holding an organic view of life, humanists find that the traditional \n    dualism of mind and body must be rejected.\" </p>\n  <p>\"Humanism asserts that the nature of the universe depicted by modern \n    science makes unacceptable any supernatural or cosmic guarantee of human values.\"  </p>\n  <p>\"We are convinced that the time has passed for theism, deism, modernism, \n    and several varieties of 'new thought'.\" </p>\n  <p>\"Religion consists of those actions, purposes, and experiences which \n    are humanly significant . . . all that is in its degree expressive of intelligently \n    satisfying human living.\" </p>\n  <p>\"In place of the old attitudes involved in worship and prayer the humanist \n    finds his religious emotions expressed in a heightened sense of personal life \n    and in a cooperative effort to promote social well-being.\" </p>\n  <p>\"Man will learn to face the crises of life in terms of his knowledge \n    of their naturalness and probability.\" </p>\n  <p>\"Believing that religion must work increasingly for joy in living, religious \n    humanists aim to foster the creativity in man and to encourage achievements \n    that add to satisfaction in life.\" </p>\n  <p>\"The humanists are firmly convinced that existing acquisitive and profit-motivated \n    society has shown itself to be inadequate and that radical change in methods, \n    controls, and motives must be instituted.\" </p>\n  <p>\"Fifteenth and last: We assert that humanism will: (a) affirm life rather \n    than deny it; (b) seek to elicit the possibilities of life, not flee from \n    it; (c) endeavor to establish the conditions of a satisfactory life for all, \n    not merely for the few.\" [Quoted in Norman L. Geisler, <i>Is Man the \n    Measure? </i>(Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Book House, l983) p.] </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 class=\"style1\">The Humanist Manifesto II was written in 1973. This document was signed by such\nnotables as the author Isaac Asimov; professors Brand Blanshard, Anthony Flew, and A.J.\nAyer; psychologist B.F. Skinner; situational ethicist Joseph Fletcher; and biologist\nJacques Monod. Following are some selections showing the general direction of the\nstatement.</h5>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <h5>\"In the best sense, religion may inspire dedication to the highest \n    ethical ideals. The cultivation of moral devotion and creative imagination \n    is an expression of genuine, 'spiritual' experience and aspiration.\" \n    The authors quickly add, however, that \"traditional dogmatic or authoritarian \n    religions . . . do a disservice to the human species.\" Further, they \n    \"find insufficient evidence for the existence of the supernatural.\" \n    For as \"non-theists, we begin with humans not God, nature not deity.\" \n    Moreover, \"we can discover no divine purpose or providence for the human \n    species.\" Hence, \"no deity will save us; we must save ourselves.\"</h5>\n  <h5>\"Promises of immortal salvation and fear of eternal damnation are both \n    illusory and harmful.\" Why? Because \"they distract humans from present \n    concerns, from self-actualization, and from rectifying social injustices.\" \n    Moreover, science has found \"no credible evidence that life survives \n    the death of the body.\" </h5>\n  <h5>\"We affirm that moral values derive their source from human experience. \n    Ethics is autonomous and situational, needing no theological or ideological \n    sanction.\" </h5>\n  <h5>\"Sixth: In the area of sexuality, we believe that intolerant attitudes \n    often cultivated by orthodox religions and puritanical cultures, unduly repress \n    sexual conduct.\" The authors affirm \"the right to birth control, \n    abortion, and divorce.\" They also permit any form of \"sexual behavior \n    between consenting adults,\" for \"short of harming others or compelling \n    them to do likewise, individuals should be permitted to express their sexual \n    proclivities and pursue their lifestyles as they desire.\"</h5>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 class=\"style1\">It calls for \"the highest commitment [i.e., to these values] of which we are\ncapable,\" a commitment which \"transcends . . . church, state, party, class, or\nrace.\" [Quoted in Norman L. Geisler, <u>Is Man the Measure?</u> pp.*ll5-*ll8]</h5>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">Later still, a number of the signatories of the second manifesto produced a document\ncalled, \"A Secular Humanist Declaration.\" The intent of this document seems to\nhave been to remove the religious designation from humanism (hence the term\n\"Secular\"). </h5>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">\"It decries contemporary orthodox religion as \"anti-science, anti-freedom,\nanti-human,\" pointing out that \"secular humanism places trust in human\nintelligence rather than in divine guidance.\" It ends by deploring \"the growth\nof intolerant sectarian creeds that foster hatred.\" </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Geisler points out that the turn away from the term \"religious humanist\" is a\nchange in tactics, because humanists, \"have pleaded for recognition as a religious\ngroup and...has even been defined as a religion by the United States Supreme Court\n(Torcaso v. Watkins, l961). [Free Inquiry, Winter l980 - 8l, p.3. also quoted in Norman L.\nGeisler, <u>Is Man the Measure?</u> p.120-121] </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">A Case Study-- Julian Huxley</h3>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">To gain a more personal feel for a famous secular humanist thinker, selections are\nincluded from Julian Huxley's book, <i>Religion Without Revelation</i>. Huxley begins by\naffirming, </h5>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>\"I believe firmly that the scientific method...is the only method which \n    in the long run will give satisfactory foundations for beliefs...It consists \n    in demanding facts as the only basis for conclusions; and of consistently \n    and continuously testing any conclusions which may have been reached by new \n    facts and, wherever possible, by the crucial test of experiment. It consists \n    also...in full publication of the evidence on which conclusions are based, \n    so that other workers may...put a quite different interpretation on the facts.\"[Julian \n    Huxley, <i>Religion Without Revelation</i>. (New York,NY: Mentor Books, l957) \n    p.l5] </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 class=\"style1\">At the same time he admits that, </h5>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>\"There are, however, all sorts of occasions on which the scientific \n    method is not applicable...(because) The exigencies of everyday life... make \n    it necessary to act on a hasty balancing of admittedly incomplete evidence, \n    to take immediate action, and to draw conclusions in advance of the evidence.\" \n    Therefore, \"It is here that belief plays its most important role. When \n    we cannot be certain, we must proceed in part by faith--\"[p.16] </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 class=\"style1\">What happened then to the scientific method? To this he responds, </h5>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>\"When there exists no evidence or next to no evidence, and when the \n    conclusion to which we may come can have no influence on the facts, <i>then \n    it is our duty to suspend judgment</i> and hold no belief, just as definitely \n    as it is our duty, when practical issues hang on our decision, not to suspend \n    judgment, but to take our courage in both hands and act on the best belief \n    at which we can arrive.\"[p.17 (Emphasis mine)] </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 class=\"style1\">How does one decide which situation one is in? Huxley explains, </h5>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>\"I hold it to be an important duty to know when to be agnostic. I believe \n    that one should be agnostic when belief one way or the other is mere idle \n    speculation, incapable of verification: when belief is held merely to gratify \n    desires, however deep-seated, and not because it is forced on us by evidence; \n    and when belief may be taken by others to be more firmly grounded than it \n    really is, and so come to encourage false hopes or wrong attitudes of mind.[p.17 \n    (Emphasis mine)] </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 class=\"style1\">Unfortunately, it is at this very point that Huxley manifests an inability to follow\nhis own creed. He continues, </h5>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>\"A personal God, be he Jehovah, or Allah, or Apollo, or Amen-Ra, or \n    without name but simply God, I know nothing of.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 class=\"style1\">This would certainly be consistent to a degree. But he goes further,</h5>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>\"...What is more, I am not merely agnostic on the subject...I disbelieve \n    in a personal God in any sense in which that phrase is ordinarily used.\" \n    [p.18 ] </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 class=\"style1\">It seems that Huxley is not withholding judgment here, but that he is affirming a\nfaith position even though the situation has not \"forced\" belief on him at all!\nHe goes on to affirm other faith positions as well, </h5>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\"> \n  <p>\"I disbelieve in the existence of Heaven or Hell in any conventional \n    Christian sense...\" </p>\n  <p>\"I believe, and believe strongly, that if the standards of good and \n    evil by which we ought to live this life are different from the standards \n    by which we may hope to achieve satisfaction or blessedness in a life to come, \n    then so much the worse for the universe and its governance; but I refuse on \n    that account to modify my standards of conduct in this world, for that appears \n    to me an outrage, and a surrender of the highest part of our nature.\" \n    [p.19] </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 class=\"style1\">It would seem as well that the emotional outcome of belief affects his view.</h5>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>\"For my own part, the sense of spiritual relief which comes from rejecting \n    the idea of God as a supernatural being is enormous.\" [p.32]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Critique</h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">We can see from the case above that the presuppositions of the secular humanist betray\nhis/her own methodology. The key then, for the Christian communicator, is to resist the\nscience/faith dichotomy, unless it is actually appropriate. In the case of morals,\naesthetics, religion, and philosophy, such a dichotomy is not appropriate. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Far from being one who has entered the light of scientific objectivity, the secular\nhumanist is often involved in blind faith of the worst kind. We begin to realize that if\nHuxley's new age finally did dawn where, \"The insufferable arrogance of those who\nclaim to be in sole possession of religious truth would happily disappear...\" he\nwould himself be the first to de-materialize. [p.33] </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The debate with secular humanists, then, is intimately tied up with the issue of burden\nof proof. If Huxley can claim that a strident denial of theism is holding \"no\nbelief\", and is \"scientific\", rather than admitting that it is an\nunverified leap of faith, then the theist will obviously be cast in a bad light. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">It is always desirable to divest one's own world view of all burden of proof, while\ncasting that burden entirely on an opponent. If on the other hand, that burden is shared\nequally (as we must insist), the humanist will have to look to his/her own problems as\nwell. It is to these problems that we now turn.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Problems with Secular Humanist's Positions</h3>\n\n<ol class=\"style1\">\n  <ol>\n    <li>The claim that all morals &amp; values are relative is first of all self-contradictory, \n      because it is stated as an absolute. There is also the problem of the inability \n      of man to live consistently with it. All men including humanists hold for \n      absolute values. Will the secular humanist admit that there is nothing necessarily \n      (or absolutely) wrong with rape and murder of a three year old girl? Also \n      be aware of the biblical problem with conflicting moral values and with \n      the best answers available. </li>\n    <li>To the humanist there is no ultimate meaning to life. Yet no one lives \n      in harmony with this view. The humanist is forced to live as if his life \n      matters, thus belying his own belief. We can be sure that the humanist will \n      not hesitate to point out where the Christian is inconsistent with his/her \n      faith! </li>\n    <li>In view of the plausibility of the existence of God, it becomes difficult \n      to see why such energy is expended trying to deny Him. It is often possible \n      to show that the secular humanist is more interested in autonomy in the \n      moral area than in discovering truth. </li>\n  </ol>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Communication</h3>\n\n<ol class=\"style1\">\n  <ol>\n    <li>Since the secular humanist is attempting to establish a science/religion \n      dichotomy, the worst thing a theist can do is to become inappropriately \n      emotional during a discussion. Yet this has too often been the case. The \n      fundamental church has also ascribed every social evil in our culture to \n      humanists, while ignoring the responsibility of the church for many of those \n      or other problems, whether by commission or omission. The result is the \n      appearance of another witch hunt rather than an objective treatment of the \n      facts. </li>\n    <li>Nothing establishes secular humanism faster than the specter of an ignorant \n      foam-flecked fanatic, looking for a secret international conspiracy by humanistic \n      devils. </li>\n    <li>It is important to also realize that the modern secular humanist has taken \n      a name for himself that has a history going back as far as the renaissance. \n      The great humanist scholars of that period, however, were mostly theists. \n      Their humanism consisted in taking an interest in the humanities-- including \n      the study of original source writings for the Bible, the classics, and other \n      works. Many humanist scholars also became a part of the reformation. Any \n      attempt by modern secular humanists to identify themselves with these men \n      should be resisted. </li>\n  </ol>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Other Reading</h3>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\"><i>Is Man the Measure? </i>Norman L.

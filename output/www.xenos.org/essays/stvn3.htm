The tabernacle hardly\nfits the usual pattern for sacred space. Shrines and temples are usually built around the\nsite of a theophany.23 A sacred grove, spring, mountain, or stone are the proper loci for\nreligious shrines. But this shrine was mobile. The sacredness of the shrine had to do with\nthe \"pattern he [Moses] had seen,\" (vs.44) and the teaching value that resulted,\nnot with its location. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Not only this, but the tabernacle sat in the barnyard of a farmer for a period of time\nthat must have been about 400 years according to the chronology of I Kings.24 During this\nwhole time--almost equal in length to the whole post-exilic history of Jerusalem--the\nlocation of the temple was irrelevant to God's working. Certainly the space Stephen\ndevoted to the history of the tabernacle must relate to the over-all theme of the speech.\nThe best guess as to the significant aspect of the tabernacle is the absence of any tie to\na geographical location. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">It is possible that God's refusal to let David build the temple, in spite of the fact\nthat he was even more favored by God than Solomon, is used to show that the temple was not\nGod's ideal. Certainly, in the original speech, Stephen cannot have failed to teach on the\ngreat text in II Sam. 7 where God declares that He has, \"been moving around in a\ntent, even in a tabernacle.\" God goes on to ask, \"Did I [ask] why have you not\nbuilt Me a house of cedar?\"25 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">This need not be seen as an argument that the construction of the temple was a mistake.\nIt was not the construction of the temple that was an error, but the false interpretation\nof the temple that had become a deadly error.26 No doubt, it was this danger that caused\nGod to reflect some negativity regarding the whole project. Yet, there is no actual\nstatement to the effect that God had not ordained the temple. Rather, there is the\nunwavering declaration that \"the Most High does not dwell in houses made by human\nhands.\" (vs. 48). </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">This was the critical misunderstanding that was inhibiting God's purposes in Stephen's\nday, as it still does today. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Stephen seems to have realized that he had already signed his death warrant by directly\nopposing the theology of the Counsel. He certainly evidences no effort at restraint in the\ndenunciation that follows.27 Stephen's Death and Legacy </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">I think entirely too much importance is attached to Stephen's reference to Christ as\nthe \"Son of Man\". The fact that this is the only usage of the term outside of\nthe gospels is accounted for by the unique nature of the confrontation, including the fact\nthat the audience is made up of Jewish Old Testament scholars. The allusion to Dan. 7:14\nseems natural and realistic in this setting. It is certainly not what makes the speech\nimportant.28 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The fact that the counsel stoned Stephen without Roman approval is an evident breech of\nRoman law, even if the crimes of blasphemy were capitol offenses. Bruce is probably\ncorrect when he observes that, </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>. . .during the closing part of Pilate's administration, especially when he was\n  resident in Caesarea, the Jewish rulers knew that they could take certain discreet\n  liberties.29 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">It remains possible in this author's mind that the counsel simply functioned as an\nillegal lynch mob.30 The main point is that the church lost a great light the day that\nStephen died. Stephen was ahead of the development of many of the other leaders in the\nJerusalem church in his understanding of the relationship of the gospel to the issues of\nrace, sacred space, and the radical change in God's program with respect to the Old\nTestament.31 Indeed, it was Philip the evangelist, another apparent Hellenist, who in Acts\n8, opens the door to Samaritans, and to the Ethiopian Eunich. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">It must have seemed like an unmitigated tragedy to have lost a visionary who understood\nbetter than most of the Apostles at this time some of the most basic aspects of Christian\nspirituality. Yet, the narrative indicates that God was at work, even though the believers\nthere would not have known it at the time. The cloaks were laid at the feet of one who\nwould later demonstrate every bit as much radicalism as Stephen--Saul of Tarsus.32</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/chhist.htm\"></a></span><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/chhist.htm\">Go back to the Church History page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/summns.htm\">Go back to The Summons page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/stvn_a.htm\">Go back to the Strange Details Table of Contents</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Ask Dennis a\nquestion or share a comment.</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/stvn4.htm\">Browse the endnotes for \"Strange Details\"</a> </p>\n\n<p>Download the whole \"Strange Details\" paper (32K) </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Bo back to the Xenos home page</a>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Strange Details in Stephen's Defense: A New Accounting III","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/stvn3.htm"}

Do you even have\nleaders meetings or believe they are a waste of time? It is difficult to imagine how a\nleader can effectively communicate to the home group &#x96; verbally and by modeling\n&#x96; excitement and direction for evangelism and discipleship without healthy leaders\nmeetings that evaluate the success and direction of the group. Here is a brief guide on\nhow leaders meetings can help a home group \"stay the course.\"</p>\n\n<p>First, let&#x92;s briefly consider some potential barriers to good leaders meetings:\n\n</p>\n\n<p><strong><a name=\"1.\">1.</a>&#xA0; <em>Leaders meetings need\nsomeone to \"chair\" the meeting. </em></strong>Their role includes\ncollecting possible agenda items (soliciting these a few days ahead of time helps\npeoples&#x92; prep), deciding which items will be discussed and which won&#x92;t be, and\nprioritizing those to be discussed first. Soliciting from the others clearly communicates\nthat their views are important to the meeting but also is an excellent training tool to\nencourage leaders and sit-in trainees to think about the group (Heb. 10:24). The\nchairperson also helps move the meeting along to make certain it doesn&#x92;t get\nunnecessarily bogged down. Often they determine either that a decision can&#x92;t be\nreached and should be discussed again at the next meeting, or they might make a decision\nif consensus was unable to be reached but a decision needed to be made. Usually, the\nchairperson is the senior leader of the leadership team. </p>\n\n<p><strong><a name=\"2.\">2.</a>&#xA0; <em>What is the mission of the\nhome group? </em></strong>Evangelism and discipleship (hope so)? If so, it is\nlogical that discussions on outreach, follow-up, discipleship and leadership training\nshould occupy the majority of time spent in a leaders meeting. How do you do this with so\nmuch sin, conflicts, events, etc. going on which need to be managed? As Nike used to say,\n\"Just do it\". If you try to get rid of the painful issues and event planning\nfirst, you&#x92;ll never get to what you know if most important. You must consciously do\nwhat is most important first and then leave a little time at the end of the meeting to\ndeal with one or two of the more pressing matters. In our group, we typically do all of\nthe event planning logistics outside of this meeting. Handle the others via telephone or\nemail communications (this is not to say try to resolve the actual problem that way, but\nthe advice/decision process that must go on between the leaders).\n\n</p><ol>\n  <p>An excellent tool for staying focused on evangelism is the decision continuum document\n  (ask your home group consultant for how to maximize this tool). </p>\n  <p>The Ministry Chart format provides an excellent framework to insure follow-up and\n  discipleship needs are being served. It also makes it easy to view the various options for\n  planting your group as you develop your plant plans. A white-board or flip-chart works\n  well in a leaders meeting to accomplish this. If you are uncertain how to utilize this\n  time-honored tool, again, ask your home group consultant.</p>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong><a name=\"3.\">3.</a>&#xA0; <em>Spiritual maturity \n  in leaders meeting is foundational if there is to be unity of purpose. </em></strong>Leaders \n  meetings are exciting if leaders and trainees receive input and admonition with \n  a desire to grow and to &#x91;be useful to the Master for every good work&#x92; \n  (2 Tim. 2:20-21) &#x96; in other words - receive correction maturely.&#xA0; \n  \"Spiritual maturity\" is a relative quality, and God will use input \n  in leaders meetings to mature us.&#xA0; Yet, there needs to be evidence of maturity \n  in this respect before inviting a trainee to sit-in the meetings.&#xA0; The \n  Christian Principles teaching on this subject helps to define what it should \n  look like to receive admonition appropriately (<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu3_encourage.htm\">Unit 3 Week 3</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The paper, <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/index.htm\">http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/index.htm</a> \n    on \"What is a leader\" and \"What Makes Someone a Christian Leader?\" \n    helps to paint a vision for the value of this type of maturity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><a name=\"4\">4.</a>&#xA0; <em>The frequency of the leaders\nmeeting</em></strong> <em><strong>will help determine how focused you can be on what's\nmost important </strong></em>(#2)<em><strong>. </strong></em> It depends in part on\nthe age range of your home group &#x96; if you are primarily single or married without\nchildren, you can probably meet more frequently than leadership teams that are primarily\nwith married couples and children.&#xA0; At least monthly leaders meetings will keep\nissues well in hand and forward progress on evangelism, follow-up, and discipleship\nmaintained. Two hours is usually enough time to accomplish most of what is needed. Many\ngroups find it helpful to link this meeting with a night where you are going to be out\nanyway &#x96; EG. if cell group starts at 8:00 PM, start leaders meeting at 6 at or close\nto where cell is, order pizza or subs so people don&#x92;t have to stop to eat first.\nSpending 15 or 20 minutes eating and fellowshipping first reconnects one another before\ngetting to the agenda.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a name=\"5.\">5.</a>&#xA0; <em>Prior collection of agenda\nitems is covered in #1. </em></strong>It is not a \"have to\" but it does\nfacilitate getting more accomplished in the shortest time, as well as insuring people are\nthinking about and giving input into the meeting agenda.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a name=\"6.\">6.</a>&#xA0; <em>Leadership teams need to be\nin agreement on the mission of the home group.</em></strong>&#xA0; If they aren't,\nthe group will go nowhere, conflicts will be more likely, or total disengagement will\noccur because of no sense of purpose. How could Phil. 2: 2 be a reality without a clear\nunderstanding of your group&#x92;s mission? (<i>make my joy complete by being of the same\nmind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose</i>). Linking the\nmission of your group to the mission of the church is logical and certainly biblical! </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Keeping a group conscious of and focused on its mission is essential to the home group,\n  and not always easy to maintain. Communicating this to your workers regularly in quarterly\n  workers meetings and cell groups is equally necessary. This can be done explicitly by\n  discussing the mission, or implicitly by talking about how the group is doing in those\n  arenas (reporting numerical growth over the past year, spiritual commitments made by\n  individuals, etc.). In a discussion format, have the workers talk about the link between\n  your structures (CT, home group, cell, parties, C&amp;C, playgroups, etc.) and the\n  mission. This revives their sense of purpose and helps maintain their outward focus. It\n  also minimizes legalistic involvement in these structures when they remind themselves how\n  God is using them to do His work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><a name=\"7.\">7.</a>&#xA0; <em>Leaders meetings are\nagonizing if there isn&#x92;t consensus on the overall health of the group.</em></strong>\nStated another way, instrumental to effective meetings is regularly committing time to\nevaluating the health of the group. There is no simple way to describe how to do this;\nworking with your home group consultant will help, but the leadership team&#x92;s\ndiscernment on this must be developed. Tools that have proven helpful (although this is\nfar from exclusive) include:\n\n</p>\n\n<dir>\n  <dir>\n    <p>See the paper <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/Hceval.htm\">http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/Hceval.htm</a> \n      for an excellent tool.</p>\n  </dir>\n</dir>\n\n\n\n<dir>\n  <dir>\n    <p>Home Group chart from the Xenos database &#x96; particularly the \"Home Group\n    Comprehensive Attendance Individual by Month\" &#x96; your consultant can provide\n    this. Obviously, you want to see that first-timers are regularly coming to meetings.</p>\n    <p>Decision Continuum chart where all workers include people they are reaching out to\n    &#x96; good for use in cell groups and/or personal discipleship.</p>\n    <p>People talking about time spent with non-Christians, spiritual conversations, etc.</p>\n  </dir>\n</dir>\n\n\n\n<dir>\n  <dir>\n    <p>The comprehensive chart mentioned in Evangelism health tracks \"returning new\"\n    statistics and calculates your follow-up ratios. The \"returning new\" charts\n    should be steadily going up. This is the only area a home group can grow. A first-timer is\n    that only once, and you can&#x92;t get more old members during the cycle of your group.\n    Therefore good follow-up of first timers is absolutely necessary for home group growth.</p>\n    <p>Nothing replaces talking about the new people, Christians and non, that \n      have been to the group lately and who is investing in them (usually the \n      person who brought them). These papers are instrumental to understanding \n      and leading home group follow-up: <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/hcfoll.htm\">http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/hcfoll.htm</a> \n      <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/fulead.htm\">http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/fulead.htm</a> \n    </p>\n  </dir>\n</dir>\n\n\n\n<dir>\n  <dir>\n    <p>The Ministry Chart is a tool proven effective for seeing that people are being invested\n    in, and its development and revisions should lead to discussions about the sanctification\n    and ministry of your workers.</p>\n    <p>Leadership development is necessary to plant a group and should be a regular topic of\n    discussion in leaders meetings.</p>\n  </dir>\n  <p>When your leadership team basically agrees on the health of the group it often leads to\n  unified discussion on direction for the group.</p>\n</dir>\n\n<p><strong><a name=\"8.\">8.</a>&#xA0; <em>Your leaders meetings\nshould train one another and sit-in trainees HOW to lead.</em></strong> Don&#x92;t\njust make decisions without talking about how to make them, what factors should be\nconsidered (ask for these, don&#x92;t just lecture), how the issue fits into the\npriorities of the group, what biblical principles are at play with the discussion, etc. In\nother words, you should be helping one another develop wisdom so that all are better able\nto make solid decisions in the future even when you aren&#x92;t there, when the next\nleadership team has been planted with their group. Does this reduce how much you\naccomplish in this meeting? Yes, absolutely. You can accomplish much more by flopping the\nissue on the table, argue briefly about each others&#x92; opinion, and then the Senior\nLeader just decide. The shortfalls of this are obvious, and there are times as mentioned\nabove, that the Sr. Leader needs to make a decision in the absence of consensus so that\nthe issue can be resolved. However, multiplication of groups requires multiplication of\nleaders who understand the biblical and relational principles that are foundational to\ndirecting a home group.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully, these elements will contribute to solid leaders meetings in your home group\nministry. Your home group consultant is an excellent source of guidance for developing\nhealthy leaders meeting dynamics. <b>Take and re-take the Leadership Class!!</b> God will\ngrow your understanding of leadership through experience and sanctification.

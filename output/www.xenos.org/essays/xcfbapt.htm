When non-Jewish people came to believe\nin God and wanted to become members of Israel, they were required to undergo an immersion\nbaptism. This baptism was a symbolic washing, through which they agreed about their need\nfor God's cleansing (forgiveness) of their sins.</p>\n\n<p>By the time of Jesus, many Jewish people believed they were accepted by God simply\nbecause they were descendants of Abraham. This is what made John the Baptist's\nmessage so revolutionary. He told the Jewish people that they needed God's\nforgiveness just as much as non-Jewish people needed it, so he called on them to admit\nthis need by being baptized (Matthew&#xA0;3:1-12). John also proclaimed that the Messiah\nwho was coming would be the One who would provide that cleansing.</p>\n\n<p>Jesus' disciples baptized his followers (John 4:1,2), and Jesus called on all\nChristians to baptize those who respond to the gospel (Matthew 28:19). Throughout the book\nof Acts, the early Christians followed Jesus' instructions. The pattern is always the\nsame: first, people put their faith in Jesus as their Savior&#x2014;and then they were baptized\nto publicly state their faith (see Acts&#xA0;2:41; 8:12,36-38; 9:18; 10:44-48;\n16:14,15,30-34; 18:8; 19:4,5). </p>\n\n<p>Christian baptism, then, is not what causes you to become a Christian&#x2014;it is something\nyou do because you have become a Christian. It is not something you do to earn God's\nacceptance&#x2014;it is something you do because you have received the free gift of God's\nacceptance through faith in Christ.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Why should you be baptized?</h2>\n\n\n<p>If you have personally received Christ, you are permanently forgiven and accepted by\nGod whether you get baptized or not (Romans 8:1; Colossians 2:13,14). However, there are\nsome excellent reasons why you should be baptized.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, Jesus asks us to get baptized (Matthew 28:19). Since he is the Lord, and\nsince his will is always good, this should be reason enough for us.</p>\n\n<p>Being baptized is an excellent opportunity for you to spiritually influence others in a\npositive way. Non-Christian friends and family members usually attend our baptisms, and\nthey are often deeply struck by the testimonies of those who get baptized. Christian\nfriends are also built up by this and motivated to continue in sharing the message of\nChrist.</p>\n\n<p>Being baptized is also an opportunity for you to take a step of faith. Getting baptized\nis a little intimidating because it involves speaking to a group of people and taking a\nstand for your faith. It is therefore stepping outside your \"comfort zone\" to do\nsomething that shares Christ and serves others. Christ will challenge you to do take such\nsteps throughout your Christian life, so you might as well discover how exciting it can be\nby getting baptized!</p>\n\n\n<h2>What is a Xenos baptism like?</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/bapcrowd.jpg\" width=\"203\">Xenos baptisms are exciting &#x2013; but different than what you may have seen in most other churches. They are informal, and starting this year (1999) usually at our new outdoor waterscape close to our main facility. Our large deck, covered shelter, and large barbecue grill add to the festive atmosphere. The baptisms are personal, because those being baptized share its meaning with the people present, and because they usually ask those who helped them come to Christ to baptize them. Part of the excitement is generated because we baptize a dozen or more people during each baptism with many of their friends and family in attendance. We view this as a time of celebration for the entire church.</p>\n<p>After someone gives a brief explanation of the meaning of baptism, the \n        fun begins. We will ask you to share for a few minutes about how you came \n        to Christ and how he has made a difference in your life. Take the time \n        to <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/testimony.htm\">think and pray about what you say</a> so that Christ gets the credit he \n        deserves! You may also want to share briefly about the person you have \n        asked to baptize you, and how he or she has helped you spiritually. After \n        you have shared, you will get into the water to be baptized by the person(s) \n        you asked to do the honors. You'll be greeted by applause when you \n        emerge after getting dunked, and then you can join us in applauding the \n        person getting baptized!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to Xenos Home Page</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\">Return to Essays Page</a> \n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n</p>\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</td></div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/bap.jpg","title":"Baptism at Xenos","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/xcfbapt.htm"}

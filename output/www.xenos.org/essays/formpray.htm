Just as legalism seeks to reform the inward by focusing on outward\nbehavior, formalism shifts the focus from the inward to things like rituals and observance\nof sacred calendars and liturgies. Of course, every Christian group and individual has\nforms through which they express or practice their faith. And any of these forms has the\npotential to replace a real heart encounter with God. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">In many religions, including some that would call themselves Christian, people practice\nformalistic prayer. Instead of a time of personal relating with God, formalistic prayer\nbecomes a ritual, a form to be followed. Just as you have to push a succession of buttons\nto get your money from an automatic teller machine, you have to follow various sequences\nof prayer disciplines to get your blessing from God. This is true whether these stages of\nprayer reflect your true state of mind or not. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Sometimes, people don't even bother to speak their own words, but instead let religious\nleaders write their prayers for them. This must have been the case when God uttered one of\nhis clearest rejections of formalism in Isaiah 29:13,14 \"Because this people draw\nnear with their words And honor Me with their lip service, but they remove their hearts\nfar from Me, and their reverence for Me consists of tradition learned by rote . . .the\nwisdom of their wise men shall perish.\" Today, nothing has changed. The religious\nmind likes to recite outward forms and formulas \"learned by rote.\" That way, we\ndon't need to put out the effort involved in relating personally.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Formalism Versus Relationship</h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">When people become formalistic, they conclude that a certain sequence of words is what\nmatters rather than the intent of their heart. It may be that people sometimes focus\nintently on the meaning of a memorized prayer, or one which is written in advance, and\ntherefore are not formalistic even when using such prayers. But it seems odd that we don't\nrelate to others this way. The danger of formalism increases when we do not spontaneously\nand naturally communicate to God, but rely instead on pre-written or memorized prayers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">In some religious groups, prayers are bought with money. Religious functionaries can be\nhired to repeat a prayer on someone else's behalf for a certain fee, even if that other\nperson is already dead! This is odd when we consider that Jesus taught against meaningless\nrepetition in prayer. (Matthew 6:7,8) </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">In some Buddhist sects, the worshippers can spin prayer wheels as they enter a shrine.\nAs the wheel spins, a printed prayer passes by a stylus, thus repeating the prayer over\nand over. A portable version can be held in the hand and spun like a toy. In this extreme\ntype of formalism we see clearly the machine-like image of prayer, and by implication, of\nGod. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Such examples are extreme, but sometimes it helps to look at some of the more extreme\nexamples in order to get the idea. We would be mistaken, however, if we thought formalism\nonly appears in these more outlandish interpretations. In fact, any of us can lapse into\nformalistic prayer if we fail to consciously resist it. Sometimes the line between\nformalism and reality in spiritual things is harder to detect, and seeing it requires keen\nspiritual sensitivity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Let's take a couple of examples. Many Christians find it helpful to have a short time\nof prayer before meals. First thing in the morning is another popular time for prayer, as\nis \"when I lay me down to sleep.\" These regular parts of our day can serve as\nreminders to pray, and we are creatures of habit. Could these times also become\nformalistic? How would we know if they were? </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Clearly, the mere fact that we pray at regular times does not mean we are formalists.\nSuch a verdict would be a focus on the external in itself. But formalism is not a matter\nof the outward. It is a deeply inward state of mind; an attitude. To determine whether\nsuch practices are formalistic, we need to look deeper. </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Critiquing Formalism</h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">What is it about formalism which makes it objectionable? Simply put, formalism is\nimpersonal. Formalists can go through their motions without ever addressing God\npersonally. Therefore, we could pray at regular times like these without being\nformalistic, but if we find we are not making personal contact inwardly with God, then we\nprobably are practicing formalism. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Imagine someone entering your living room and reading out a pre-written statement\nbefore turning and leaving. Is this a personal interaction? Suppose your neighbor stops by\nyour house before eating each meal, sticks his head in your door and rattles off the same\nfew words before closing the door and leaving. Would this be personal communication? It\nmight be, if you had dropped off his meal for him and he was just dropping by to thank you\nfor it. But clearly it might not be personal. Formalism is truly an inward attitude, not\nan outward action. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Sometimes we mouth words of prayer at appropriate times without any thought whatsoever.\nWhen we are formalistic, we, like any legalist, can tell ourselves we have prayed several\ntimes that day, so all is well. Whether there is any personal reality to our prayer lives\nis another question. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Escaping formalistic thinking is not always an easy matter. Changing the forms we\noperate under can give us an opportunity to reevaluate our outlook, but it won't solve the\nproblem. Any form can become formalistic. We may pray very contemporary prayers at odd\ntimes and in strange ways but still be as formalistic as ever. This is because what\nmatters is not the forms, but how we view those forms. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The main thing to do when we realize we are relating to God formalistically is to\nrepent and set out to immediately reestablish personal rapport with him at that moment. I\nfind that corporate prayer helps me avoid formalism. By joining into the thoughts of\nothers, and by sharing my prayers with others, I seem to be able to focus my attention for\nlonger periods of time. The perspectives of others challenge my own thoughts, causing me\nto come out of preconceived or ill-conceived notions and reconsider what God would want.\nPerhaps this is one of the reasons God calls special attention to the importance of\ncorporate prayer.

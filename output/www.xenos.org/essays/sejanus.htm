He is well known among Roman historians as the man who almost succeeded\nin overthrowing Tiberius Caesar. However, his relationship with Pontius Pilate has an\nimportant influence on what year one dates the death of Jesus. The purpose of this paper\nis to give an overview of Sejanus' life, to examine his relationship with Pilate, and\nfinally to understand the impact of this information on the date of Jesus' death.</p>\n\n<h3>An Overview Of Sejanus' Life</h3>\n\n<h5>Birth and Youth</h5>\n\n<p>Sejanus was born sometime between 4 BCE and 1 BCE in Etruria.<a name=\"Footnote1A\">Footnote1</a>\nHe was born into an equestrian family and thus was not part of Roman nobility. Virtually\nnothing is known about his youth.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after Tiberius became emperor in 14 CE, he made Sejanus' father Strabo\ncommander of the Praetorian Guard, the elite corps of Roman soldiers responsible for\nprotecting the city of Rome and the emperor himself.<a name=\"Footnote2A\">Footnote2</a>\nStrabo was one of Tiberius's most trusted administrators. He was awarded this post because\nof his life-long loyalty and service to Tiberius.<a name=\"Footnote3A\">Footnote3</a> The\nearliest reports of Sejanus' adult life place him in Rome with Strabo at this time. Thus,\nSejanus almost definitely grew up knowing Tiberius personally and had easy access to him,\nan advantage which he was to later exploit.</p>\n\n<h5>Early Career</h5>\n\n<p>In 16 CE, Sejanus was appointed Commander of the Praetorian Guard by Tiberius when he\nmade Strabo prefect of Egypt.<a name=\"Footnote4A\">Footnote4</a> Sejanus distinguished\nhimself by significantly improving the organization of the Guard. Whereas they had\npreviously been quartered haphazardly with friends and neighbors, Sejanus built barracks\nfor them so that they could be more quickly mobilized in time of need.<a name=\"Footnote5A\">Footnote5</a></p>\n\n<p>In 17 CE, Sejanus was sent by Tiberius to accompany Drusus to suppress the mutiny of\nthe Pannonian legion.<a name=\"Footnote6A\">Footnote6</a> Drusus was the son of Agrippina\nand Germanicus, who was seen as the heir-apparent to Tiberius. Again, Sejanus\ndistinguished himself in this assignment and was rewarded for it by Tiberius. This may\nhave been interpreted by Drusus as a lack of confidence in him by Tiberius and thus\ncontributed to Drusus' enmity and rivalry toward Sejanus. Certainly this attitude toward\nSejanus emerged after Drusus' father Germanicus died in 19 CE and Drusus became the\nheir-apparent.<a name=\"Footnote7A\">Footnote7</a></p>\n\n<p>In 23 CE, a fire broke out in a theater in Pompeii which ravaged the city. Sejanus was\nassigned to handle the situation and restore the city. He did such an effective job that\nTiberius ordered a statue of Sejanus in his honor be erected at the site of the new\ntheater.<a name=\"Footnote8A\">Footnote8</a></p>\n\n<p>Thus, Sejanus's early career gave clear evidence of excellent administrative ability.\nAlways looking for someone who could ease the burden of administration, Tiberius evidently\nwas impressed by Sejanus's work. Tiberius thus continued to depend more and more on\nSejanus and take him into his confidence.<a name=\"Footnote9A\">Footnote9</a> This set the\nstage for Sejanus's rise to power.</p>\n\n<h3>The Rise of Sejanus</h3>\n\n<p>In 23 CE, Drusus died after a short, violent illness. Most Roman historians state that\nDrusus' death was actually due to being poisoned.<a name=\"Footnote10A\">Footnote10</a> This\nexplanation is based the testimony of Sejanus' wife shortly before she was executed in 31\nCE. She stated that Sejanus and Drusus' wife Lavilla had become lovers and that they had\nconspired to kill Drusus so that Sejanus could take his place as heir-apparent to\nTiberius. Both the goal of Sejanus' ambitions and the real cause of Drusus' death is\nambiguous and much debated by modern historians.<a name=\"Footnote11A\">Footnote11</a></p>\n\n<p>At any rate, with Drusus dead, Tiberius was in an unenviable spot. Now 64 years old, he\nhad for years wanted to retire from public life, leaving the leadership of the empire to\nhis successor and the Senate. Now he was unable to do so. The oldest male family members\nwere Drusus' children (Drusus, Nero and Gaius), and they were too young to be appointed\nco-emperors.<a name=\"Footnote12A\">Footnote12</a> In presenting these children to the care\nof the Senate, Tiberius lamented his situation and even expressed a longing for the return\nof the Republic.<a name=\"Footnote13A\">Footnote13</a> Tiberius knew that his desire for the\nSenate to take a more active role as they did in the Republic was unrealistic. Therefore,\nhe knew he would be unable to retire until one of these children grew to adulthood and\ndemonstrated competence, <cite>unless</cite> he had an administrator so competent and\ntrustworthy that he could safely leave the government in his hands as his regent in Rome.\nIt was to this position that Sejanus immediately aspired. In Tiberius, he found a man\nstrongly motivated to let him attain that role.</p>\n\n<p>As Tiberius gave Sejanus more and more authority, Sejanus used his position to\neliminate those who were obstacles to his goal of ultimate power. In 25 CE, he had Cordus,\na historian, condemned, ostensibly for justifying Brutus' assassination of Julius Caesar.\nRoman historians state that the real reason was that Cordos was an outspoken enemy of\nSejanus.<a name=\"Footnote14A\">Footnote14</a></p>\n\n<p>In 26 CE, Tiberius retired to the remote and almost inaccessible island of Capri, never\nto return to Rome again.<a name=\"Footnote15A\">Footnote15</a> Sejanus had played a major\nrole in convincing Tiberius to do this.<a name=\"Footnote16A\">Footnote16</a> He also\n\"proved\" his total loyalty to Tiberius by shielding Tiberius with his own body\nduring a cave collapse that year.<a name=\"Footnote17A\">Footnote17</a> While still\nretaining his full imperial authority, he left Sejanus in Rome as his regent. From this\npoint on, Sejanus' power increased dramatically. He was not only Tiberius' spokesman,\nwhich made the senators curry his favor; he also carefully controlled all communications\nto Tiberius on Capri.<a name=\"Footnote18A\">Footnote18</a> In this way, Sejanus was able to\nprey on Tiberius's fears of revolt and use him to eliminate the legitimate successors of\nTiberius. Whether Sejanus was actually aspiring to become emperor, or only seeking to\neliminate possible heirs so that he would not be eliminated by them when they came into\npower is not clear.<a name=\"Footnote19A\">Footnote19</a> What is clear is that he used his\nposition to eliminate them.</p>\n\n<p>Immediately after Tiberius left Rome, Sejanus attempted to set Agrippina and her\ngrandsons against each other. Through his own agents, Sejanus tried to convince Agrippina\nand Nero to leave Rome for their safety.<a name=\"Footnote20A\">Footnote20</a> Through the\nsame agents, he was sending a steady report to Tiberius of their activities, attempting to\nconvince him that they were plotting revolt and should be executed. For the rest of 26 CE,\nneither plan worked. Agrippina and Nero did not flee Rome, and Tiberius was not yet\nconvinced that they constituted a serious threat to his power.</p>\n\n<p>In 27 CE, Sejanus had Sabinus, a supporter of Agrippina, condemned for sedition.<a name=\"Footnote21A\">Footnote21</a> In the same year, he asked Tiberius for permission to\nmarry Lavilla, Drusus' wife.<a name=\"Footnote22A\">Footnote22</a> This would have gained\nhim greater legitimacy with the Roman nobility and improved his chances of actually\nbecoming emperor. Tiberius refused to grant permission, seemingly out of deference to\nRoman etiquette, while promising Sejanus much greater honor and fame and power in the near\nfuture:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"What projects I have turned over in my mind; by what further ties I am preparing\n  to bind you to myself, I will forbear for the present to disclose. This only I will permit\n  myself to say, that there is no place too high for your merits, and your devotion to\n  myself; and when the proper time shall come, whether in the Senate, or before the public,\n  I shall not fail to speak.\"<a name=\"Footnote23A\">Footnote23</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Historians disagree on Tiberius' motives for his reply. Some think that Tiberius should\nbe taken at face value, and that he still fully trusted Sejanus.<a name=\"Footnote24A\">Footnote24</a>\nOthers think that Tiberius was suspicious of Sejanus by now, but also realized that he was\nin a precarious position since he was in Capri and Sejanus was in control.<a name=\"Footnote25A\">Footnote25</a> If this was the case, Tiberius' reply was calculated to\nblock Sejanus' power move, without arousing Sejanus' suspicions that Tiberius suspected\nhim of revolt.</p>\n\n<h3>The Peak of Sejanus's Power</h3>\n\n<p>Sejanus reached the peak of his power in 29 CE. Tiberius' mother died during this year,\nyet he refused to come to her funeral in Rome. This is probably because he had begun to\nbelieve Sejanus' charges that Agrippina was actively seeking to assassinate him.<a name=\"Footnote26A\">Footnote26</a> Later that same year, Tiberius accused Agrippina (by\nletter before the Senate) of adultery and Nero of \"vices\".<a name=\"Footnote27A\">Footnote27</a>\nBoth were exiled, where Nero eventually committed suicide and Agrippina, after being\nill-treated by her guards, starved herself to death.<a name=\"Footnote28A\">Footnote28</a>\nHe also got Tiberius to condemn and imprison Drusus, where he committed suicide.<a name=\"Footnote29A\">Footnote29</a> Only Gaius (now seventeen but with no administrative\nexperience) and Gamellus, a boy of ten, remained alive as heirs from the Julio-Claudian\nline.<a name=\"Footnote30A\">Footnote30</a> Gaius lived with Tiberius on Capri at this time,\nmaking him inaccessible to Sejanus.</p>\n\n<p>In early 30, Sejanus had Gallus, another supporter of Agrippina, condemned for\nsedition.<a name=\"Footnote31A\">Footnote31</a> When Sejanus got permission from Tiberius to\nmarry Livia Julia (Gaius' sister), he was in a seemingly very advantageous position. With\na marital claim to nobility, he was in a better position to be accepted by the nobility if\nhe attempted to seize imperial power. If that route was deemed seemed infeasible, he could\npersuade Tiberius to appoint him Gaius' supervisor when Tiberius died and thus still\nretain full control over the Emperor.<a name=\"Footnote32A\">Footnote32</a></p>\n\n<p>During 30, Sejanus also began to consolidate his power over the Roman armies in foreign\nlands. He probably realized that in the event of a revolt they could crush him if they did\nnot want him as emperor. So he replaced many of the commanders with men loyal to him, and\nhe deposed many who were loyal to Drusus and his family.<a name=\"Footnote33A\">Footnote33</a></p>\n\n<p>During the period from 29 to 30 CE, Tiberius made it clear that he regarded Sejanus as\nhis exclusive representative in Rome. The Senate voted that his birthday be honored\npublicly. Public prayers and sacrifices were offered on behalf of \"Tiberius and\nSejanus\" and oaths were sworn \"by the Fortunes of Tiberius and Sejanus\".<a name=\"Footnote34A\">Footnote34</a> Twice previously during his reign, Tiberius had held the\nconsulship of the Senate with his acknowledged successor: in 18 CE with Germanicus, and in\n21 CE with Drusus. Now in 30 CE, Tiberius declared his intentions to make himself and\nSejanus consuls the following year.<a name=\"Footnote35A\">Footnote35</a> All indications\nwere that soon Tiberius would confer the tribunician power on Sejanus, making him a <i>de\nfacto</i> joint-emperor and successor of Tiberius after his death.<a name=\"Footnote36A\">Footnote36</a></p>\n\n<h3>The Fall of Sejanus</h3>\n\n<p>Probably in early 31 CE, Tiberius received a letter from his widowed sister-in-law\nAntonia.<a name=\"Footnote37A\">Footnote37</a> Perhaps because she had always remained above\nthe intrigues of Roman politics, Tiberius trusted her. She told him that Sejanus was\nplotting a revolt and detailed many of the ways in which he was doing this. Whether or not\nthis was the first time Tiberius suspected Sejanus is debatable.<a name=\"Footnote38A\">Footnote38</a>\nHowever, from this time forward, he acts in such a way that makes it clear (at least to us\nin retrospect) that he knew of Sejanus' treason.</p>\n\n<p>First, Tiberius began to send a \"mixed message\" about Sejanus to the Roman\nsenators. On the one hand, he continued to lavish praise and power upon him. He referred\nto Sejanus as \"my Sejanus\". He fulfilled his promise to make Sejanus a consul of\nthe Senate, and minted coins and erected statues in his honor. On the other hand, he began\nto speak in a mildly critical way of Sejanus and his allies.<a name=\"Footnote39A\">Footnote39</a>\nHe also refused to condemn Arruntus against Sejanus's wishes, and thus prevented Sejanus\nfrom gaining full control over the Senate.<a name=\"Footnote40A\">Footnote40</a> Later that\nsame year, Tiberius resigned his consulship, thus forcing Sejanus to do the same<a name=\"Footnote41A\">Footnote41</a>. Tiberius then made Gaius consul, thus indicating that\nhe had now chosen Gaius as his successor.<a name=\"Footnote42A\">Footnote42</a> He forbade\nall sacrifices to living humans, thus stopping public homage to Sejanus.<a name=\"Footnote43A\">Footnote43</a></p>\n\n<p>While Tiberius was thus keeping Sejanus off-balance, he was testing the loyalty other\nquarters of leadership in Rome. He ascertained that the senators strongly disliked Sejanus\neven though they had curried his favor. He also found that the Praetorian Guard was loyal\nto Sejanus only as his (Tiberius') regent.<a name=\"Footnote44A\">Footnote44</a></p>\n\n<p>Thus satisfied of his security, Tiberius hatched a brilliant and elaborate plot to\ndepose Sejanus.<a name=\"Footnote45A\">Footnote45</a> He made Macro the new commander of the\nPraetorian Guard. He then sent Macro to Rome with a letter to be read before the Senate.\nMacro intercepted Sejanus on the way and told him that the letter gave him tribunician\npower - virtual imperial authority. Once Sejanus went inside, Macro presented proof of his\nPraetorian authority over Sejanus' guards. He then sent them back to the barracks and\nsurrounded the Senate with his own loyal soldiers. While the purposefully long, rambling\nletter was read, Macro went to the barracks to assure that no uprising would take place\namong the troops.</p>\n\n<p>Tiberius' rambling letter ended with a scathing denunciation of Sejanus and demanded\nhis arrest. Stunned, Sejanus was led out. When the senators saw that the common people and\nthe Praetorian Guard rejoiced at Sejanus' arrest, they condemned and executed him the same\nday - October 18, 31 CE.</p>\n\n<h3>After Sejanus's Fall</h3>\n\n<p>Tiberius then launched an investigation into the conspiracy. All of Sejanus' family\nwere killed, as was customary.<a name=\"Footnote46A\">Footnote46</a> Though Tacitus\ndescribes this period as a reign of terror and a blood-bath, Seutonius and others\ndisagree.<a name=\"Footnote47A\">Footnote47</a> Tarver says that Tiberius moved in to check\nthe indiscriminate persecution of Sejanus' friends.<a name=\"Footnote48A\">Footnote48</a>\nTiberius evidently made a real effort to be just in his investigation. Over the next three\nto four years, many people were tried. Some were convicted and executed; some were allowed\nto turn state's evidence; some were acquitted. All in all, several dozen people were\nexecuted.<a name=\"Footnote49A\">Footnote49</a> Satisfied that the conspiracy had been\nsufficiently rooted out, Tiberius dropped the matter around 34 CE. He died shortly\nthereafter in 37 CE.</p>\n\n<p>The Relationship Between Sejanus and Pilate</p>\n\n<p>The available evidence indicates that Pilate was appointed to the office of prefect of\nJudea by Sejanus. This evidence consists of two bases.</p>\n\n<h5>The Date Pilate Was Sent to Judea</h5>\n\n<p>No ancient record dates the beginning of Pilate's rule in Judea exactly, nor do they\nspecifically say that Sejanus appointed Pilate. The only chronological record of Pilate's\nappointment is found in Josephus who says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"(Tiberius)...sent Valerius Gratus to be procurator of Judea, and to succeed Annus\n  Rufus...When Gratus had done those things, he went back to Rome, after he had tarried in\n  Judea <i>eleven</i> years, when Pontius Pilate became his successor...So Pilate, when he\n  had tarried <i>ten</i> years in Judea, made haste to Rome...but before he could get to\n  Rome, Tiberius was dead.\"<a name=\"Footnote50A\">Footnote50</a> (italics mine)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Josephus infers (and the subsequent chronology demands) that Tiberius sent Gratus very\nsoon after becoming emperor. Tiberius became emperor on September 17, 14 CE.<a name=\"Footnote51A\">Footnote51</a> Pilate was removed from office to appear immediately\nbefore Tiberius, but Tiberius died while Pilate was en route. Tiberius died on March 16,\n37 CE.<a name=\"Footnote52A\">Footnote52</a> Therefore, Pilate was removed no later than\nlate 36 CE.</p>\n\n<p>Gratus therefore assumed his post in 15 CE at the latest. If he ruled for approximately\neleven years, then he was removed in 26 or 27 CE. If Pilate ruled approximately ten years,\nhe must have begun his rule in 26 or 27 CE. Therefore, both agree that Pilate was sent to\nJudea in either 26 or 27 CE.</p>\n\n<p>Tiberius retired to Capri sometime in 26 CE.<a name=\"Footnote53A\">Footnote53</a> The\nexact date is not known, but because of the above data, it is very likely that Pilate was\nsent after Tiberius retired. In that case, he was appointed by Sejanus.<a name=\"Footnote54A\">Footnote54</a> Even if he was appointed slightly before Tiberius\nretired, it is likely that Sejanus was still the main influence behind the appointment,\nsince Tiberius had granted considerable authority to Sejanus in these kinds of matters by\nthis time.</p>\n\n<h3>Sejanus' and Pilate's Anti-semitic Policies</h3>\n\n<p>Josephus details Pilate's hatred and baiting of the Jewish people, which will\nelaborated upon below. Philo claims that Sejanus was anti-semitic and planned to destroy\nthe Jewish race completely.<a name=\"Footnote55A\">Footnote55</a> Though Tiberius was\nprobably also anti-semitic, he realized after Sejanus was exposed that many of the charges\nbrought against the Jews were fabricated by Sejanus, so in 32 CE he issued a decree\nthroughout the Empire not to mistreat the Jews.</p>\n\n<p>It is likely that Pilate was simply carrying out Sejanus' anti-semitic policy. Philo\ndoes not actually say this; rather, this is inferred from what Philo says in the following\npassage. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Therefore everyone everywhere, even if he was not naturally well disposed toward\n  the Jews, was afraid to engage in destroying any of our institutions, and indeed it was\n  the same under Tiberius though matters in Italy became troublesome <i>when Sejanus was\n  organizing his onslaughts</i>. For Tiberius knew the truth, he knew at once after Sejanus'\n  death that the accusations made against the Jewish inhabitants of Rome were false\n  slanders, invented by him because he wished to make away with the nation, knowing that it\n  would take the sole or the principal part in opposing his unholy plots and actions, and\n  would defend the emperor when in danger of becoming the victim of treachery. <i>And he\n  charged his procurators in every place to which they were appointed</i> to speak\n  comfortably to the members of our nation in the different cities, assuring them that the\n  penal measures did not extend to all but only to the guilty, who were few, and to disturb\n  none of the established customs but even to regard them as a trust committed to their\n  care, the people as naturally peaceable, and the institutions as an influence promoting\n  orderly conduct.\"<a name=\"Footnote56A\">Footnote56</a> (italics mine)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is clear from this passage that Sejanus was propagating anti-semitic policies while\nhe was in power. It is also clear that procurators with jurisdiction over Jewish\ncommunities practiced those policies under Sejanus' authority. Finally, it is clear that\nTiberius told those procurators that such policy was no longer permissible.</p>\n\n<p>What prefect would have had more policies concerning the Jews than Pilate? Certainly\nPilate's treatment of the Jews prior to the fall of Sejanus conforms to Sejanus' policies,\nas we will see. Pilate must have received Tiberius' edict after Sejanus' execution, for\nhis treatment of the Jews changes after 32 CE, as we will also see. Therefore, it is\nreasonable to assume that Pilate was either appointed to his position by Sejanus, or at\nleast that he was a willing executor of Sejanus' policies toward the Jews.</p>\n\n<p>Eusebius, almost quoting Philo, clearly makes the same inference:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"...Sejanus, who was then in great favor with Tiberius, had made every effort to\n  destroy the whole nation of the Jews from the foundation, <i>and that</i> in Pontius\n  Pilate under whom the crimes were committed against our Savior, having attempted\n  everything contrary to what was lawful among the Jews respecting the Temple at Jerusalem,\n  which was then yet standing, excited them to the greatest tumults.\"<a name=\"Footnote57A\">Footnote57</a> (italics mine)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These quotes, together with the chronological data supplied above, indicate that Pilate\nwas probably sent to Judea by Sejanus and that he actively pursued Sejanus's policies with\nthe Jews. Pilate held his post by the favor of Sejanus and he was identified with Sejanus\nby those over whom he ruled.</p>\n\n<p>The Effect of Sejanus on Dating Jesus' Death</p>\n\n<p>Before one can meaningfully assess the effect of Sejanus on the dating of Jesus's\ndeath, certain facts must be first understood.</p>\n\n<h5>The Possible Dates of Jesus' Death</h5>\n\n<p>Since Jesus died while Pilate was procurator of Judea, he must have died roughly\nbetween 26 and 37 CE. Furthermore, the New Testament states that he died on a Passover\nwhich fell on a Friday.<a name=\"Footnote58A\">Footnote58</a> Astronomical calculations\nascertain that this occurred possibly on 27 CE, and almost certainly 30, 33 and 36 CE.<a name=\"Footnote59A\">Footnote59</a> 27 and 36 CE can both be discounted because of Lk.\n3:1,2.<a name=\"Footnote60A\">Footnote60</a> Therefore, Jesus died either on 30 or 33 CE.</p>\n\n<p>If one assumes that Pilate was appointed by Sejanus and was actively carrying out his\npolicies, two important aspects of the gospel narratives of Jesus' trial make perfect\nsense if the date is 33 CE, after Sejanus' downfall. However, the same aspects are very\nproblematic if the date is 30 CE, before Sejanus' fall.</p>\n\n<h5>Pilate's Change in Behavior Toward the Jews</h5>\n\n<p>As was noted above, Pilate had a consistent record of hostility toward the Jews - even\nto the point of baiting them several times. Soon after arriving in Judea, he had ordered\nRoman standards brought within the city of Jerusalem under the cover of night, knowing\nthat it would infuriate the Jewish people's beliefs about the sanctity of the city. When\nthey protested he threatened to kill many of them and not until they bared their throats\nto be cut did he realize that the move was not worth the trouble.<a name=\"Footnote61A\">Footnote61</a></p>\n\n<p>On another occasion, Pilate used money from the Temple treasury to construct an\naqueduct. When the Jews assembled outside his quarters to protest, he ordered soldiers to\ndress like the Jews and mingle among the crowd. On his signal, the soldiers drew clubs\nhidden in their clothes and beat and killed many of the Jews.<a name=\"Footnote62A\">Footnote62</a></p>\n\n<p>Later, possibly in 29/30 CE, Pilate introduced coins engraved with a symbol of\nEmperor-worship.<a name=\"Footnote63A\">Footnote63</a> In Lk. 13:1, Jesus is asked about the\n\"Galileans whose blood Pilate mingled with their sacrifices\", a reference to the\nmurder of some Jews coupled with purposeful desecration of Jewish worship.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the early years of Pilate are characterized by an almost complete disdain\nfor the Jews. He purposefully baited them into reacting and then punished them for\nreacting. It would be very consistent for him to do this if he was Sejanus' appointee. </p>\n\n<p>Yet the gospels, though clearly cognizant of Pilate's past behavior, present Pilate\nduring the trial as a man fearful of the Jews and eager to please them. He knows Jesus is\ninnocent<a name=\"Footnote64A\">Footnote64</a>, but gives into condemning him in order to\nplease the Jews. One would expect exactly the opposite reaction from Pilate: that he would\ninsist on Jesus's acquittal <cite>because</cite> the Jewish leaders wanted him condemned.\nInstead, the gospels say that Pilate tried to release Jesus because the Jewish leaders\ndelivered up out of envy<a name=\"Footnote65A\">Footnote65</a> (i.e., to bait them), but\nthat when they threatened him with an appeal to Rome, he backed down and granted their\nwish.<a name=\"Footnote66A\">Footnote66</a></p>\n\n<p>How is this discrepancy to be explained? Such behavior is simply not tenable before\nSejanus' demise. As was noted above, Sejanus was executed on 31 CE. From 31 to 34 CE,\nTiberius was investigating and prosecuting Sejanus's co-conspirators. If Jesus's trial was\nafter this time, especially if it was after Tiberius's 32 CE decree against mistreating\nthe Jews, Pilate would be very uneasy about any report getting back to Tiberius. Being\nSejanus' appointee, he may well have been under suspicion already as it was. However, if\nJesus' trial occurred in 30 CE, there would be no reason for Pilate to not continue his\npolicy of baiting the Jews, since Sejanus was in control and would back him up.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the drastic change in Pilate's behavior toward the Jews in Jesus's trial is very\nconsistent after 31 CE, but very inconsistent before that time.</p>\n\n<h3>The Jews' Use of \"Amicus Caesaris\"</h3>\n\n<p>During the trial of Jesus by Pilate, Pilate several times tells the Jewish leaders that\nJesus is innocent. On his final attempt, John records:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"...Pilate made efforts to release him (Jesus), but the Jews cried out, saying 'If\n  you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar; everyone who makes himself out to be a\n  king opposes Caesar.' <i>When Pilate therefore heard these words</i>, he brought Jesus\n  out, and sat down on the judgment seat...And so he then delivered him up to them to be\n  crucified.\"<a name=\"Footnote67A\">Footnote67</a> (italics mine)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The term \"friend of Caesar\" (Latin: <i>amicus Caesaris</i>) is a technical\nterm reserved for senators, knights and administrators who were meritorious and thus\nfavored by the emperor.<a name=\"Footnote68A\">Footnote68</a> To lose this title was to lose\nnot only one's post, but also to possibly complete ostracism from Roman life, as\nillustrated by Gallus in 26 BCE under Augustus.<a name=\"Footnote69A\">Footnote69</a></p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the Jews were uttering a threat to Pilate. They were claiming to have the\npower to potentially have Pilate stripped of this title. This threat is highly significant\nfor two reasons. First, it is inconceivable that the Jews would utter it as long as\nSejanus was in control. They knew that all communication to Tiberius was controlled by\nSejanus, and they also knew that Pilate's anti-semitic policies were in accordance with\nSejanus' policies.<a name=\"Footnote70A\">Footnote70</a> Such a threat makes sense <i>only</i>\nif Tiberius is back in control of the empire <cite>and</cite> if Pilate is under imperial\ncensure or warning because of his association with Sejanus.</p>\n\n<p>Second, even if the Jews did utter such a threat, Pilate would have had no reason to\nrespond to it while Sejanus was in control. Pilate's response becomes intelligible <cite>only</cite>\nafter 31, when Sejanus was deposed.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion</p>\n\n<p>The fact that Sejanus's downfall came in 31 CE has a very significant impact on dating\nthe death of Jesus. Only 30 or 33 CE are tenable years for Jesus' death. Pilate was\nprobably Sejanus' appointee who actively carried out his anti-semitic policies, and thus\nwas in danger after Sejanus was executed. The behavior of Pilate and the Jews during the\ntrial of Jesus makes sense only after Sejanus' demise. Therefore, 33 CE is the preferable\ndate for the death of Jesus.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\">Return to the Essays page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to the Xenos home page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:DeLashmuttG@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=sejanus\">Ask Gary\na question or share a comment.</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a name=\"Footnote1B\">Footnote1</a></p>\n\n<p>Charles Edward Smith, <cite>Tiberius and the Roman Empire</cite> (Baton Rouge:\nLouisiana State University Press, 1942), p. 116.</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"Footnote2B\">Footnote2</a></p>\n\n<p>Evidently, Sejanus held this position with his father Strabo already at this time.

Marsh agrees, saying, \"The number of\nprosecutions is much smaller than might have been expected after what had passed, and the\nproceedings seem to show that a real attempt was made to secure justice; in short the\nwhole of the Tiberian Terror is a product of imagination and rhetoric quite unsupported by\nevidence\" (see Frank Burr Marsh, The Reign of Tiberius, p. 200).</cite></p>\n\n<p><a name=\"Footnote48B\">Footnote48</a></p>\n\n<p>J.

He says, \"It seems more than\nprobable that in 26 AD, Pontius Pilate was nominated to succeed Valerius Gratus as <cite>praefectus\nJudaeae by L. Aelius Sejanus...Undoubtedly it was Pontius Pilate's implementation of\nSejanus' policy in Palestine which caused the familiar imbroglios with the Jews...\"\n(see P.L. Maier, \"Sejanus, Pilate and the Date of the Crucifixion\", pp. 8,9).\nHoehner is almost as strong. He says, \"It is probable that when Pontius Pilate\nsucceeded Valerius Gratus as prefect of Judea in AD 26 he was appointed by the equestrian\nLucius Aelius Sejanus\" (see Harold W. Hoehner, \"Chronological Aspects of the\nLife of Christ, Part V: The Year of Christ's Crucifixion\", Bibliotheca Sacra 131\n(October-December, 1974):341). These authors are trying to establish a 33 CE death date\nfor Jesus, so their views on this issue may be somewhat biased. However, other sources not\nbiased in this area also agree that Pilate owed his appointment to Sejanus.

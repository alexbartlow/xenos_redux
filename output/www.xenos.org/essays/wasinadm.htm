As long as that identity remains the same, our outer actions may\nchange to some extent, but such change doesn't amount to much in the ultimate sense.\nLosing our identity in Adam is different than losing our sin nature, as we will see later.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Consider our treatments for the common cold. We take nasal decongestants to reduce\ninflammation. We take aspirin for the headaches and pains. We may even take an\nantihistamine to dry up our runny nose. But one thing should be clear: none of these\nthings will cure the cold. Such treatments only control the <strong><i>symptoms</i></strong>\nof the cold, they cannot cure it. That's because there <strong><i>is</i></strong> no cure\nfor the common cold! Since we have no cure, we might as well at least try to control the\nsymptoms. We have no better option.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Many Christians must have reached the same conclusion about their sin nature. They are\ntrying different solutions to control the worst of the symptoms of the Adam-nature, but\nnone of their measures are getting at the source of the problem. This is unfortunate,\nbecause with the Adam-nature, we do have a cure! It's a shame to see people dealing with\ntheir sin problems only on the symptomatic level when they could be experiencing real\nchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"style1\">An important qualification</h2>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Before going on, we need to make one very important qualification. When we argue that\ntrying to alter our outer behavior is like trying to control the symptoms of a cold, you\nmight conclude that any effort to deal with external behavioral problems is Phariseeism.\nYou might even conclude that efforts in this direction will prevent or block real change\nbased on who you are rather than on what you do. But this would be the wrong conclusion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">There is nothing wrong with controlling negative symptoms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Controlling symptoms is not <i>wrong</i>, but it is <i>insufficient</i>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"style1\">We should find ways to decrease destructive behavior in our lives and to increase\npositive behavior. Such behavioral control only becomes a problem when controlling our\nbehavior is <strong><i>the only thing</i></strong> we do. It becomes a serious problem\nwhen we begin to define our spiritual state on the basis of how well the battle with\nbehaviors is going.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">To state this differently, the issue is not whether we attempt to control behaviors,\nbut how we view that attempt. Do we see controlling our behaviors, or our performance, as\neither the <strong><i>definition</i></strong> of spiritual growth or the <strong><i>key</i></strong>\nto spiritual growth? If we answer \"yes\" to either one of these questions, we\nhave a very serious problem, not unlike that of the Pharisees. On the other hand, there\nmay be certain areas of sin in our lives which need to be controlled in an external way,\neven though this is not the key to growth. We need to control some particularly\ndestructive behaviors even if by external means, so they will not block our advancement\ntoward maturity on a deeper level. We could say that, while controlling negative behavior\nis not the key to growth, it could be a pre-condition to growth in some cases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Let's look at a couple of examples where this might be true. Suppose you are an\nalcoholic. Your drinking and your abuse of your family are sinful and destructive.\nStopping these behaviors will not make you a mature Christian, but it may nevertheless be\nnecessary to seek control of the behaviors, <strong><i>even through external means</i></strong>,\nlike avoiding drinking situations or even entering a hospital. Stopping the drinking, may\nopen the door for other, more complete solutions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The same could be true of promoting positive behaviors. Suppose you are one who has\nproblems with other people. You don't like to go out in the evening, and groups of people\nmake you nervous. In such a state, it may be very difficult to take advantage of Christian\nfellowship. Unless you find ways to overcome such a reluctance to act, it will be\ndifficult to fully understand God's plan for your life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Again, a problem arises when the struggle to gain a measure of control over certain\nareas of behavior becomes the defining issue of our lives. It is all too easy to begin to\nview enhancement of our external performance as being equal to spiritual growth. But even\nnon-Christians change their behavior! Many Hindu and Buddhist religionists undergo\ndisciplines much more impressive than any we are likely to practice. But is this the same\nas being conformed to the image of Christ? It is not.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"style1\">The fate of the Adamic person</h2>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">If we received our identity in Adam simply by being born, how will we ever get rid of\nit? The Bible is crystal clear on this point:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The only possible fate for the person in Adam is death. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"style1\">God will not set about renovating the Adamic person for use in the Kingdom. The verdict\nof death has already been decreed over this humanity. Verse 15 of Romans 5 states it\nplainly: \" . . .by the transgression of the one the many died . . ..\" Earlier in\nRomans this message is repeatedly emphasized. \"The wages of sin is death,\"\nproclaims Romans 6:23a, and we can rest assured, God will not change his verdict. Yet, he\nis able to say, \" . . . the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our\nLord.\" (6:23b)</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">We already know that Christ bore the penalty for our sin on the cross. This explains\nwhy God can forgive us and give us eternal life. But what about the effect of his death in\n<strong><i>this</i></strong> life? How will the death of Christ affect our spiritual\ngrowth?</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Here is where our study of identity in Adam begins to pay dividends. Romans 5 and 6\nteach that, like Adam, Christ has become a new federal head. This is what Paul means in\nRomans 6, verses 3 and 4:</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been\nbaptized into His death? Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into\ndeath, in order that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father,\nso we too might walk in newness of life. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">We saw earlier the only way to escape the domination of the Adam nature is death. Now\nthis passage mentions death in the same connection, but with a different twist. Here we\ndiscover not only that Jesus died in our place but that somehow we died <strong><i>with</i></strong>\nhim.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">This passage is teaching that God has declared us to be \"in Christ,\" which,\namong other things, means we have died to what we were \"in Adam.\" What does this\nsaying , \"in Christ,\" mean? It is easy to understand a similar statement;\n\"Christ in me.\" I open my heart, and Christ enters as promised in Revelation\n3:20 and elsewhere. But here we are hearing something completely different: not Christ in\nme, but me in Christ!</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">This is what theologians call \"identification with Christ.\" It means God has\nacted in such a way that we have become <strong><i>identified</i></strong> with Christ.\nTherefore, as far as God is concerned, what is true of Christ's standing has become true\nof us. Did Jesus die? Then so did I. Did Jesus rise from the dead? Then I, too, rose from\nthe dead. The comparisons can be pressed even further. Did Jesus ascend to the Father in\nheaven? Then according to my identification with Christ, I too ascended to heaven and took\nmy seat at the right hand of the Father! This is expressly stated in Ephesians 2:5,6:\n\"And even when we were dead in our sin and transgression [God] made us alive together\nwith Christ . . . and raised us up with him, and seated us with him in the heavenly places\nin Christ.\" Of course we have not become the creators of the world, nor have we\nbecome deity, but the areas where we are identified with Christ go much further than many\nof us would think.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">This seems quite abstract. In what sense am I seated with Christ in heaven? In what\nsense am I still seated right here? How can God say I died, when I clearly am alive?\nWouldn't I have noticed this experience?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"style1\">Using Our Insight</h2>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">We already have the key to answering these questions. That key is federal headship.\nAdam was our federal head. We didn't feel or sense anything he did. There was no tangible\nexperience on our part. Yet, what we <strong><i>are</i></strong> was directly impacted by\nthis man. In&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; ICorinthians 15:45 it says,\n\"The first Adam became a living soul, the last Adam became a life giving\nspirit.\" Jesus is the last Adam. He is a second federal head. He is called the last\nAdam because, just as Adam gave rise to a fallen humanity, Christ has become the source of\na new, righteous humanity. One humanity is doomed to die; the other humanity has already\ndied. One humanity lives in alienation from God; the other is alive to God.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Paul reiterates this in I Corinthians 15:21,22. \"For since by a man came death, by\na man also came the resurrection from the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ\nall shall be made alive.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"style1\">Baptism into Christ</h2>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">These statements in I Corinthians are no different than what we have seen in Romans 6.\nAccording to our passage, the key to our new identity is that we have been \"baptized\ninto Christ.\" This is not referring to water baptism, but to spiritual baptism.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The word <strong><i>baptizo</i></strong>, which is translated \"baptize\" need\nnot refer to a ritual where people are washed or immersed in water. Sometimes the term is\nused for immersing people into other things. For instance, John said Jesus would baptize\npeople in the Spirit or in Fire. (Matthew 3:11) Jesus asked James and John whether they\nwere able to undergo the baptism he would undergo, apparently referring to his suffering\nand death. (Mar. 10:38) There are other uses of the word as well. It should be clear that\nthe exact meaning of baptism must be determined in each passage by considering the\ncontext. The word means \"immersion\" or a \"putting into.\" But immersion\ninto what?</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Here in Romans 6 he is not commenting on our immersion into water, but into Christ.\nThis the baptism by the Spirit. Paul says this \"baptism,\" or immersion into\nChrist, is an integral part of becoming a Christian. He often refers to God's act of\nplacing believers into Christ. In I Corinthians 12:13 he says, \"By one Spirit we were\nall baptized into one body . . ..\" This is why believers are called the body of\nChrist. In I Corinthians 1:30 Paul says, \"by God's doing you are in Christ\nJesus.\" The Spirit of God has somehow baptized, or placed us into Christ.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Theologians refer to this oneness with Christ as the \"mystical union\" of\nbelievers with Christ. Over 100 times in the New Testament the expressions \"in\nChrist,\" \"in the beloved,\" \"in him\" or similar phrases are used\nof believers. The mystical union of the believers with Christ is not an obscure concept\nfound off in the corner somewhere. Many of the most important promises God has given us\nare linked directly to this union.

Christ is\nvictorious; therefore we are led in his victory. Christ is at the right hand of God;\ntherefore we are also. According to Romans 6, death and resurrection are two of the most\nimportant things true of us if we are in Christ.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"style1\">God's Viewpoint</h2>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Whatever this teaching means, it must be very important, considering the promises\nattached directly to it. It may help to consider the problem from God's viewpoint.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">As already stated, God's verdict on the Adam nature is final. We will never experience\nfreedom from our fallen nature until we die and are resurrected in a new body. What is God\nto do in the meantime? One solution might be to strike dead all who receive Christ\nimmediately and take them to heaven right there and then. This solution has some obvious\ndrawbacks. If everyone who believed in Christ immediately fell dead, Christian evangelism\nmight become harder than it already is! Besides, who would do the witnessing?</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Whether for these reasons or others, this is not the direction God has decided to go.\nInstead of striking all believers dead, he has judicially <strong><i>declared</i></strong>\nthem dead by identifying them with Christ. This means God elects to view us as though we\nwere in Christ. That is, he views us the same way he views his son. This is certainly good\nnews. Our standing before God couldn't be higher! But is it real? Or is this just double\ntalk? How can it be true that I have died and am seated in heaven, when I am clearly\nsitting right here, seemingly the same as ever?</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">There are a few points which should help clarify this concept for us.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">First, who views us as being \"the righteousness of God?\" I know I find it\nvery hard to view myself that way. My wife finds it even harder! No, it is God who, in the\nfirst place, views me this way. But we should not take this to mean our identification\nwith Christ is just some dream in the mind of God. Actually, our status is quite real.\nConsider the fact that one day our fallen existence will end, either when we die or when\nthe Lord returns. However, our standing in Christ will never end. When we think of it this\nway, our standing in Christ is even more \"real\" than our life in Adam.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Second, the fact that we have been identified with Christ is an item of faith for\nChristians. I Corinthians 1:30 says, \"by God's doing you are in Christ.\" That is\na plain proposition which we might not fully understand, but which we need to accept as a\ndirect declaration by God. We don't need to be able to confirm this statement with some\nkind of experience or feeling. It is a fact of Scripture, which deserves willing belief\nfrom those of us who view Scripture as our ultimate standard of truth. The truest thing\nabout us is what God says about us.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Remember, we did not sense or feel anything of Adam's fall, yet we received a fallen\nnature because he was our federal head. There certainly could be other explanations for\nwhy we have a selfish nature. The reason we, as Christians, believe our problems came from\nAdam is not that our experience tells us so, but because God has declared this to us in\nhis Word.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">God also declares that those of us who have trusted Christ have died and risen with\nhim, though we cannot feel this truth either. Therefore, we have the same reason for\nbelieving in our identification with Christ as in our identification with Adam--God tells\nus so.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Finally, when we consider our sense of identity, we realize that how God looks at us is\nnot an unimportant abstraction. This idea is so important, and it comes up so often in the\nstudy to follow, we will devote a whole chapter to understanding it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/wiv.htm\">Return to the Walking in Victory page</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/index.htm\">Return to the Books page</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\">Return to the Essays page</a> \n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n</p>\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"As in Adam so in Christ","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/wasinadm.htm"}

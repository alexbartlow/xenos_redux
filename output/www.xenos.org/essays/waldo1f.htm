He is\nreferred to variously as Valdes, Valdesius, Valdensius and Waldo (Valdo), from the city of\nLyons. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>References to the movement he founded (\"Waldensians\" \"the poor of\nLyons\" \"the Leonese\" \"the Poor of Lombardy\" or simply \"the\nPoor\") appear repeatedly throughout the succeeding centuries of European history.\nThey are always in the shadows, always under bitter persecution, always hard to\nunderstand, but always seemingly at the cutting edge of reformation ferment.</big></p>\n\n<h2><a name=\"Historiography\">Historiography</a></h2>\n\n<p><big>The actions and views of Waldo are shrouded in shadow, because neither he, nor\ncontemporaries in his movement ever chronicled their lives. No existing documents speak of\nthe exact year of his birth, of his youth, or even of the very last years of his life.1\nThis problem is made worse by the fact that the Poor of Lyons themselves desired to\nestablish an argument for their legitimacy based on antiquity. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>In a day when there was only one legitimate church, the Poor of Lyons felt that\nthey had to answer the charge that they must be heretics because they were new. Therefore,\nthey developed an argument that they were the remnant of a movement that had been\nresisting the Roman Catholic Church since the time of Constantine's donation of the\nwestern empire to Pope Sylvester in the fourth Century AD. This claim depended on the\nspurious documentation for the donation of Constantine, which both Catholics and\nWaldensians believed to be authentic at the time but which is actually without historical\nsupport.2 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>This development would have been harmless enough, but unfortunately, some early\nProtestant historians, writing in the 1600's were also in the market for a claim to\nantiquity. They saw the Waldensians as the bridge between themselves and the Apostles.3\nThey were inclined to believe the legends of the Poor of Lyons, and unfortunately they had\npossession of the earliest authentic Waldensian manuscripts.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>These documents were compiled with commentary in a history written by Perrin,\npastor at Lyons in the year 1618.4 Perrin's history was commissioned by the Synod of\nDauphiny (which included the now reformed Waldensian Churches).5 A few years later, in\n1655, John Leger, a Waldensian pastor, compiled another collection of source material,\nwhich eventually wound up in the library of the University of Cambridge.6 Perrin and Leger\nattributed dates to the documents which were far too early. Some Waldensians documents\nwere dated as early as 1100 AD, (at least 60 years before the movement began). Other\ndocuments from the reformation period were dated as coming from before the reformation.\nThis had the effect of portraying the Waldensian movement as reformed in doctrine\nthroughout their history, whereas in fact they were not reformed until after the\nreformation.7</big></p>\n\n<p><big>In 1875, Alexis Muston published The Israel of the Alps, which, although critical\nof some of the earlier work, such as Perrin's,8 continued to accept the basic thesis that\nthe Waldensians originated at the time of Sylvester. Almost every Protestant work done\nsince the time of Muston in turn has depended on his work until recent times. In fact,\nstudies carried out by denominations such as the Presbyterians as recently as 1912 have\ncontinued to follow this line.9 Catholic sources are no better. Melia is an example of a\nRoman Catholic author as recently as 1870 attempting to deny that religious persecution of\nthe Waldensians occurred at all.10 In the same way that John Leger accepted exaggerated\naccounts of the persecution, Melia has accepted non-credible Roman Catholic accounts.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>It is perhaps not surprising that study of the Waldensians has become unpopular\namong scholars because it is viewed as the province of biased ideologues. For these\nreasons, there are few contemporary histories of the Waldensian Movement that have\nscholarly credibility.11</big></p>\n\n<p><big>Because of these developments, it is difficult for the average student of history\nto arrive at a clear picture of the chronology and development of the movement without\ncareful comparison of contradictory material. Further, in this case one must not only\ncompare different authors, but must also ascertain that they do not depend on each other.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>All we have from the earliest period is a few fragmentary writings from letters,\ncommentaries and poems which circulated within the group, and a larger body of\ncontemporary material written by Roman Catholic clerics, all from a hostile point of view.\nTherefore, as with so many \"heresies\" of the medieval period, it is necessary\nfor the student to read between the lines of detractors' comments to separate the facts of\nthe situation from the polemical elements in the inquisitorial literature.</big></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/waldo1f.htm#Contents\"><big>Return to the Table of Contents</big></a></p>\n\n<h2><a name=\"Beginnings\">Beginnings</a></h2>\n\n<p><big>According to one report from an inquisition prosecution found in Church archives\nin Carcassonne, France, the movement known as the \"Poor of Lyons\" began in about\n1170. The document goes on to state that Waldo himself had been a rich merchant who\nunderwent a religious experience which led him to renounce all of his wealth, and \".\n. .observe a life of poverty and evangelical perfection, as the Apostles.\"12 This\nsort of commitment can hardly be considered unusual during this period of history.\nHowever, Waldo went further:</big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>He arranged for the Gospels and some other books of the Bible to be translated in\n    common speech . . . which he read very often, though without understanding their import.\n    Infatuated with himself, he usurped the prerogatives of the Apostles by presuming to\n    preach the Gospel in the streets, where he made many disciples, and involving them, both\n    men and women, in a like presumption by sending them out, in turn, to preach.</big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>These people, ignorant and illiterate, went about through the towns, entering\n    houses and even churches, spreading many errors round about.13 </big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>Here the heart of what the Poor were all about as well as the crux of their\ndispute with the Roman Church is evident. Gui goes on later,</big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>The principal heresy, then, of the aforesaid Waldensians was and still remains the\n    contempt for ecclesiastical power. Excommunicated for this reason and delivered to Satan,\n    they were precipitated into innumerable errors. . . The erring followers and sacrilegious\n    masters of this sect hold and teach that they are not subject to the lord pope or Roman\n    pontiff or to any prelates of the Roman Church. . .\"14</big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>The fact that Waldo and his followers rejected riches and lived an austere life\nwas not objectionable to the hierarchy of the Roman Church. The same thing was being done\nby tens of thousands all over Europe. Neither do there seem to have been substantive\ndoctrinal differences at first.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>This last point is important, because the most intriguing aspect of the Poor is\nprecisely that there was initially no important doctrinal difference. They saw themselves\nas Roman Catholics who were carrying the doctrines of Christianity further than their\nweaker brethren. They even sent a delegation to the third Lateran Council in 1179 to\nobtain Papal approval of their work. There they were examined by an English friar, Walter\nMapes, who in 1184 was in Rome for the council. He recounts, </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>We saw Waldensian men in the Roman Council held by Pope Alexander the Third. They\n    were simple and unlearned, and were thus called from the name of their founder, Valdo, who\n    was a citizen of Lyons on the Rhone. They presented to the Pope a book written in the old\n    Provencal language,15 in which there were texts and comments of the Psalms, and of many\n    books of the Old and New Testament.16</big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>Mapes questioned them at the council along the following lines, </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>Do you believe in God the Father? They answered, \"We believe.\" And in\n    God the Son? They answered \"We believe\" And in God the Holy Spirit? They\n    answered, \"We believe.\" And in the mother of Christ? They answered \"We\n    believe\". . .</big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>At this point the court broke out in laughter because according to Scholastic\nTheology, one could only use the formula \"believe in\" with reference to the\nTrinity. After this conversation, the delegation \"withdrew, covered with\ndisgrace,\" because they had fallen for a trick question.17 They were ordered to cease\npreaching, and obey their bishop. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>It is easy to see from this incident that there was no serious issue of doctrine\nat stake. The Waldensian dispute then, centered on the issue of authority. It was the fact\nthat they translated the scriptures, studied them, and \"presumed\" to preach what\nthey believed, without reference to the clergy that was unacceptable.18 Melia declares,</big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>. . .when John a Bellismanibus, Archbishop of Lyons, about the year 1182 . .\n    .forbade them both to preach and . . .expelled them from his diocese; no mention was made\n    of their holding any doctrine at variance with the teaching of the Church: they were\n    simply expelled because, being laymen and illiterate, . . . they presumed, against the\n    prohibition of their superiors, to preach, and exercise an office which was confided to\n    the Apostles and to their successors only.19</big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>They were arguing that they could draw insight directly from the pages of their\ntranslated Bibles rather than from the Roman Church.20 As one of our earliest sources,\nAlan of Lille put in his chapter entitled, \"By what authority and for what reason it\nis shown that no one ought to preach unless he has permission from the Bishop,\"</big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>There are certain heretics. . .called Waldenses, after their heresiarch, who was\n    named Waldus, who--led by his emotions, not sent by God--founded a new sect and presumed\n    to preach without the authority of the Bishop, without divine inspiration, without\n    knowledge, and without literacy. He was an irrational philosopher, a prophet without a\n    vision, an apostle without a mission, a teacher without an instructor, and his foolish\n    disciples have led the simple folk astray in many parts of the world. 21</big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/waldo1f.htm#Contents\"><big>Return to the Table of Contents</big></a></p>\n\n<h2>The <a name=\"Historico\">Historico</a>-theological Milieu</h2>\n\n<p><big>Waldo was neither the first nor the only divergent voice raised inside and outside\nof the Roman Catholic Church at this time and place. Europe was aflame with new religious\nmovements reacting to such things as the struggle of the Papacy for supremacy, the corrupt\npractices of local clergy, and the currents of thought that were flowing into the area as\na result of the Crusades.22 The Albigensians or the Cathari were the leading schizmatic\ngroup,23 but there were many other attacks as well. In 1140 the bishops of France wrote to\nthe Pope that,</big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>Everywhere in our cities and villages, not only in our schools but at the street\n    corners, learned and ignorant, great and small, are discussing the gravest mysteries.24</big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>In the history of this period we find reference to numerous heretical groups,</big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>1. In 1259 the Flagellants appeared. By a kind of mass contagion men, women, and\n    children bewailed their sins and many of them marched through the streets, naked except\n    for loin cloths, crying to God for mercy, and scourging themselves until the blood ran.25\n    \"They proclaimed complete certainty of salvation to all who should persevere in\n    flagellation for thirty-three days. Scourging was the one necessary sacrament. They were\n    condemned in 1349.\"26</big></p>\n    <p><big>2. The Beguines comprised a variety of lay groups which seem not to have been\n    confined to any specific set of forms and to have displayed wide variety. Deanesly says\n    they were, \"the followers of Lambert le Begue, (the Stammerer). . . devout but\n    unlettered lay people, who set great store on the use of vernacular scriptures. Lambert's\n    followers were called from his surname, in Dutch, Beghards, (whence the English word\n    \"beggar\") in Latin Beguini or Beguinae.\" She claims that the early\n    Waldensians joined forces with groups of Beguinae.27</big></p>\n    <p><big>3. Tanchelm began to preach in the diocese of Utrecht and early in the twelfth\n    century his views had fairly wide currency in the Low Countries and the Rhine Valley. He\n    attacked the entire structure of the Catholic Church, denied the authority of the Church\n    and of the Pope, and held that at least some of the sacraments were valueless.</big></p>\n    <p><big>4. Early in the twelfth century, Peter of Bruys, himself following a strictly\n    ascetic way of life, rejected the baptism of infants, the Eucharist, church buildings,\n    ecclesiastical ceremonies, prayers for the dead, and the veneration of the cross. The\n    Petrobrusians re-baptized those who joined them, profaned churches, burned crosses, and\n    overthrew altars. </big></p>\n    <p><big>5. Sometimes classed with Peter of Bruys, but perhaps mistakenly, was Henry of\n    Lausanne. Like the former he preached in what is now France and in the first half of the\n    twelfth century. Before his death in 1145 he is said to have attracted a wide following,\n    called Henricians. He taught that the sacraments were valid only when administered by\n    priests who led a life of asceticism and poverty. He condemned the clergy of the day for\n    their love of wealth and power.28</big></p>\n    <p><big>6. The Adamists conducted their worship in the nude.29</big></p>\n    <p><big>7. Arnold of Brescia. . .was earnestly eager to see the Church conform fully to\n    the Christian ideal. Believing that this could not be so long as its leaders compromised\n    with the world, he attacked the bishops for their cupidity, dishonest gains, and frequent\n    irregularity of life and urged that the clergy renounce all property and political and\n    physical power. . .in 1155 he was hanged, his body was burned, and his ashes were thrown\n    into the Tiber. . . .30</big></p>\n    <p><big>8. In Northern Italy, \". . .the \"Pataria\" had some years earlier\n    grown up spontaneously in reaction to an increasing corrupt and politically oriented\n    clergy.\" They were apparently the descendants of the Bogomils, who in turn grew out\n    of the dualistic \"Paulicians\".31</big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>In addition to these were numerous lesser movements, of which Latourette admits,\n\"We shall probably never learn even the names of all of them.\"32</big></p>\n\n<p><big>Even this short list demonstrates that there were questions being asked at this\ntime, many of which are strikingly similar to those issues raised by the Poor of Lyons: </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <ul>\n      <li><big>--the question of poverty and asceticism as a means of growth and/or salvation, </big></li>\n      <li><big>--questions about the role of ritual, </big></li>\n      <li><big>--activism of various sorts among the laity, </big></li>\n      <li><big>--questions about the integrity of the clergy.</big></li>\n      <li><big>--questions about interpretation and application of the Bible.33</big></li>\n    </ul>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>It is likely that Waldo and his followers were influenced by some of these\nmovements, although it is not clear how much. It would be too coincidental to see such\ncommon themes arising apart from any influence whatever. The fact is that there was a\ncultural and religious milieu shaping the thinking of this movement.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>For example, we can place Lyonese poor nuclei in the same area of France as the\nCathari, at a time when the Catharite revolution was at its height.34 Also, both southern\nFrance and northern Italy were hot-beds of dissident zeal during the very period of the\nrise of the Waldensians.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>On the other hand, the Neo-Platonic and dualistic aspects of so many of these\ngroups is not as evident in the teachings of the Waldensians during the earliest period.\nThere is undoubtedly some platonic asceticism involved in Waldo' renunciation of wealth.\nMany of the new groups, including the mendicant orders of monks were renouncing all wealth\nat this time, and traveling around as beggars and preachers.35 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>It is important to realize that the reason they did so was not in order to relieve\npoverty through a more equitable distribution of goods, but because the suffering incurred\nfrom being poor was good for the soul. The material world was viewed with suspicion, and\nanything that served to separate one from it would bring him/her closer to the Spiritual\nworld, that is, closer to God.36</big></p>\n\n<p><big>Significantly, shortly after the time of Waldo, Boanaventure would argue that\npoverty had been Christ's pattern, carried on for some time by monks such as the Egyptian\nanchorites, \"but poverty declined after the Donation of Constantine and was not\nrevived until the thirteenth century with the foundation of religious mendicancy by\nFrancis and Dominic.\" This view of history was identical to that held by the\nWaldensians.37</big></p>\n\n<p><big>Tourn and others argue that this ascetic ideological base was not the case with\nthe Waldensians. Their basis for renunciation of wealth was a literalistic application of\nLk. 9:3-6, and Mk. 10:23-27, which are not ascetic. In other words, \". . .one might\nsay that Waldensian piety was eschatological rather than dualist or ascetic.\"38</big></p>\n\n<p><big>This may be partially true for another reason. We find no reference to the\nmonastic literature anywhere in the early Waldensian literature. The Cistercian order,\nwhich had been organized around 1119 believed that, </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>. . .the rule (of St. Benedict) was not merely a guideline or a set of positive\n    laws which can be dispensed, but rather a species of Divine Law, which like the\n    Commandments of the Gospel, has to be interpreted, but cannot be changed or dispensed.39</big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>This point of view, so typical of all of the orders at this time, is absent from\nearly Waldensian thinking. They based their movement of the authority of the scriptures.40</big></p>\n\n<p><big>Another distinction between the Waldensians and the monastic idealists at this\ntime was the outward focus of the Poor of Lyons. They were not seeking primarily inner\npiety, but aggressive outreach to others.</big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>\". . .Waldo's case was different [than most poverty enthusiasts]. His vow did\n    not lead him to a monastery and to a life of contemplation and obedience. He was an\n    ordinary citizen among the poor and was determined to remain so. . .41</big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>\"For the Poor the bond of unity lay not in the sacraments but in their\n    apostolic mission. Christian virtue, then, was in demonstrating love, and care for the\n    brethren.</big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>\"Everyone of them, old and young, men and women, by day and by night, do not\n    stop their learning and teaching of others.\"</big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>An inquisitor quotes, in the same vein, one of the Poor who had been brought\nbefore him: \"In our home, women teach as well as men, and one who has been a student\nfor a week teaches another.\" 42</big></p>\n\n<p><big>Thus the Waldensians were more activistic and outreaching than sacramental or\nreflective.43</big></p>\n\n<p><big>Perhaps if there had been more dependence on monastic ideology the later history\nof the Waldensians would have been very different. Not long after the time of Waldo,\nanother new order arose not far from the region of Lombardy under the leadership of\nFrancis of Assisi. The similarities between these groups is quite striking. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Both were operating in the same area at about the same time. Francis was also\nuntrained in theology. His followers, like the Waldensians, were unlearned. They lived in\nvoluntary poverty, dressing in course cloth and sandals--exactly like the Waldensians.\nThey traveled around sometimes and preached, as the Waldensians did, although the emphasis\nwith the Franciscans was more on service while that of the Waldensians was more on\npreaching. Both were critical of the Roman Church's failure to fully live up to the ideals\nof Scripture. Both went to Rome to obtain papal approval for their orders. And this is\nwhere the similarity stops.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>Francis did obtain approval from the Pope, while Waldo did not.44 Thus the\nFranciscans were taken into the embrace of the Church. This exempted them from persecution\nfor the time being, and in fact, Franciscans were often leaders of the persecution of the\nWaldensians. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>The question of the relationship of the Waldensians to the other doctrinal\ncurrents of that time is hard to determine exactly. There is no evidence of any influence\nfrom other groups on Waldo himself, until after his condemnation. Earlier, for instance,\nhe directly denounced the Albigensians' doctrine.45</big></p>\n\n<p><big>The most important point in this is that there was no ideological or theological\nbreakthrough that occasioned the Waldensian movement.46 Their existence was not the result\nof any change in theology, but rather a change in theopraxy--the Poor of Lyons translated\nthe Bible, and preached it in their own words.47 Thus, the Waldensians are an early test\ncase in the area of lay ministry. Their main sin was to take too literally the Biblical\ncommand to, \". . .teach them to observe all that I commanded you.\" </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Not only did they refuse to deny the right of the laity to preach and teach, they\nalso allowed and encouraged women to teach. This had tremendous shock effect on their\nculture, at the same time that it probably tapped an hitherto unknown source of power.48\nIt would be easy to underestimate the impact that this feature had on the Europe of 1170.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>It was after their excommunication that the Poor of Lyons' doctrine became\nobjectionable to the Roman Catholic Church. More than a hundred years later, it was said,</big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>Among all the sects, there is none more pernicious to the Church than that of the\n    leonists, and for three reasons: </big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>In the first place, because it is one of the most ancient; for some say that it\n    dates back to the time of Sylvester; others to the time of the Apostles.</big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>In the second place, because it is the most widespread. There is hardly a country\n    where it does not exist.</big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>In the third place, because, if other sects strike with horror those who listen to\n    them, the Leonists, on the contrary, possess a great outward appearance of piety. As a\n    matter of fact they lead irreproachable lives before men, and as regards their faith and\n    the articles of their creed, they are orthodox.</big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>Their one conspicuous fault is, that they blaspheme against the Church and the\nclergy, points on which laymen in general are known to be too easily led away.49</big></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/waldo1f.htm#Contents\"><big>Return to the Table of Contents</big></a></p>\n\n<h2><a name=\"Doctrine\">Doctrine</a> before the reformation</h2>\n\n<p><big>Either in 1184 or in 1215 the Waldensians were excommunicated from the Roman\nCatholic Church.50 We know that in 1184 the French bishops who were called to the Council\nof Verona included them in the list of \"condemned movements.\" Further, in 1190\nthe Bishop of Narbonne pronounced a condemnation for heresy.51</big></p>\n\n<p><big>As in the case of Luther, over 350 years later, the excommunication of Waldo\nproved to be the occasion of increased theological polarization. Tourn argues that during\nthis period, Waldo was influenced by \"the Cathari, Pierre de Bruys, the monk Henri\nand others.\"52 From these schismatics, they heard stiff criticism of the Roman\nCatholic Church.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>For the first time, the movement began to include radical protest in its views.\nClearly, there was a need to re-define their views on the sacraments, and other features\nof ecclesiology, since they no longer had access to these \"means of grace\"\nthrough the Church. Yet the shift seems to have been minimal, especially in the area of\nsoteriology. There was still no breakthrough in the area of salvation by grace. On the\nother hand, all of the changes that did occur during this period were in the same\ndirection as later reform movements. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Adding momentum to change was the merger with some northern Italian splinter\ngroups. These groups heard in the preaching of the Poor of Lyons views that they already\nheld. Latourette says that the Waldensians were \". . .joined by many of the\nHumiliati, who had arisen in and near Milan and in that same year (1184) had come under\nPapal prohibition. . . They criticized prayers in Latin on the ground that they were not\nunderstood by the people, and derided church music and the canonical hours.\"53</big></p>\n\n<p><big>These dissidents were established before the time of Waldo, and tended to have a\nmore communal ideal in their piety. They probably had the effect of stabilizing a movement\nwhich was devoted to vagrancy by providing centers of agitation (this also made them easy\nto locate, and therefore vulnerable). Milan had such a welcoming attitude that they\npermitted the Waldensians to build their own house of prayer. This may have been the only\noccasion on which they could openly have such a building for the next 300 years.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>The Lombards, as the North Italian group was called, had many ideas of their own.\nThey were actually thrown out of the Waldensian movement in 1205 by Waldo, but later\nre-joined. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Melia, who argues that the Waldensians were not Protestant in their doctrine, can\nbe counted on to refuse all exaggeration in the area of the Poor's evangelical beliefs. He\ndoes admit (and documents each from more than one authentic Waldensian source) the\nfollowing listing of their divergent views during the period before the Hussite\nrevolution.</big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>1. The Church of God has failed.</big></p>\n    <p><big>2. The Holy Scriptures alone are sufficient to guide men to Salvation.</big></p>\n    <p><big>3. The blessings and consecrations practiced in the Church do not confer any\n    particular sanctity upon the things or persons blessed or consecrated.</big></p>\n    <p><big>4. Catholic priests. . .have no authority; and the Pope of Rome is the chief of\n    all heresiarchs.</big></p>\n    <p><big>5. Everyone has the right to preach publicly the word of God</big></p>\n    <p><big>6. Every oath is a mortal sin.54</big></p>\n    <p><big>7. Purgatory is a dream, an invention of the sixth century. </big></p>\n    <p><big>8. The indulgences of the Church are an invention of covetous Priests.</big></p>\n    <p><big>9. There is no obligation to fast, nor to keep any holy day, Sunday excepted.</big></p>\n    <p><big>10. The invocation of Saints cannot be admitted.</big></p>\n    <p><big>11. Every honor given in the Church to the holy images of paintings, and to the\n    relics of Saints is to be abolished.</big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>To this list, he adds doctrines that belong to the period between the Hussite\nrevolt and the Lutheran Revolution:</big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>1. Auricular Confession is useless, and. . .it is enough to confess our sins to\n    God.</big></p>\n    <p><big>2. The definition of the church is, \"the whole of the elect from the\n    beginning of the world to its end.\" and that regarding ministries, \"the holy\n    Catholic Church is the congregation of all ministers and people obeying the Divine will,\n    and by obedience united. . .\"</big></p>\n    <p><big>3. It is necessary to receive the Eucharist under two kinds.55</big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>To these I would add,</big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>1. The church and the state should remain as separate authorities.56</big></p>\n    <p><big>2. The Eucharist is to be viewed as a memorial, not as a sacrifice.57</big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>It will be seen that every one of these doctrines are the natural outgrowth of\nexclusion from the Roman Church. It was natural that the Poor of Lyons, feeling that they\nhad acted out of devotion to God from the beginning, would wonder whether denial of access\nto the priestly functions of the Roman Church could alter their destiny. Especially with\nthe Bible in their own language, it was natural that they would re-examine these issues,\nand ultimately deny Roman Catholic teaching in these areas. Therefore the rejection of\npriestly function in the church was probably done in reaction to the action of the Roman\nChurch, rather than being a native sentiment of the movement.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>Regarding the last point, on the Eucharist, it may be asked how the Waldensians\nthought they would obtain salvation, since Roman Catholic doctrine has the grace of God\nbecoming effective through the sacraments. Here, it seems that no clear answer is\navailable. Apparently, the worshiper is to do his/her best to be good, and ask forgiveness\nfrom God for the rest. There was also confession to a \"barba\" (\"uncle\"\nor teacher-leader) and prayer on behalf of the penitent.58 Unfortunately, the grace aspect\nof Huss' teaching seems to have been substantially lost on the Waldensians. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Given these tenets, there does not seem to be warrant for referring to \"two\nreformations\" as does Amedo Molnar--the first being the Hussite and the Waldensian\nmovements, and the second, being the movements of the sixteenth century.59 At the same\ntime, it must be admitted that these two movements did make a substantial though\nincomplete movement back toward the biblical model. The Waldensian movement was a\nrevolution based on radical ecclesiology, but without substantial change in soteriology.\nTheir contribution should not be disregarded any more than the Lutheran and Calvinists,\nwho continued to accept unbiblical doctrine in the area of eschatology and ecclesiology.</big></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/waldo1f.htm#Contents\"><big>Return to the Table of Contents</big></a></p>\n\n<h2><a name=\"Growth\">Growth</a> and Reaction</h2>\n\n<p><big>During the thirty or so years between the excommunication of Waldo and the first\nmajor genocidal crusade against them, the movement spread at an astonishing rate. There\nwere cells of activity right across southern Europe by the year 1208 when the crusade\nagainst the Albigensians was proclaimed by Innocent III. </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>In this year there began a crusade against the Cathari60 akin to the one that had\n    been going on against the Muslims for some time. This was the first time the crusade\n    concept had been used against dissidents who called themselves Christian. \"For twenty\n    long years Languedoc and Provence in France were subjected to a blood bath which not only\n    wiped out the most advanced culture of the time but introduced it into the Church, and\n    from there throughout the West, the rule that any ideological deviation must be crushed by\n    force.\"61</big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>It is important to remember that this period (1150-1300) were the years of the\nzenith of papal temporal power. Innocent III described himself as \"set between God\nand man, lower than God but higher than man, who judges all and is judged by no one. .\n.\"62 He declared that, \"the priesthood was as superior to the kingship as the\nsoul to the body,\" and he informed the nobles of Tuscany that, \"just as the moon\nderives its light from the sun . . .so too the royal power derives the splendor of its\ndignity from the pontifical authority.\"63 As has been the case so often in history,\ngreater political power for the institutional church has been bad news for Christian\nminorities.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>This was also the pattern that would characterize Roman Catholic reaction to the\nWaldensians for the next 450 years. The history of the Waldensians during this period is\nan incredible litany of genocidal disaster. This was the period of the inquisition in\nEurope, and it is through the well kept records of the inquisition that we follow the\nspread of the Waldensians movement throughout Europe. Tourn lists some of the major\npersecutions after the crusade of 1208:</big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>1. We know that at the beginning of the 14th century there were enough Poor\n    remaining in France that the inquisitor Jacques Fournier, who later became Pope Benedict\n    XII, undertook court trials against them.</big></p>\n    <p><big>2. The transference of the papacy to Avignon in the middle of the 14th century was\n    apparently the signal for a brutal repression against Waldensians in the Dauphine, for the\n    beleaguered Pope was evidently not disposed to tolerate any expression of dissidence so\n    near to his exiled see.</big></p>\n    <p><big>3. In the year 1380. . . [a severe] round-up was begun under the inquisitors\n    Martin of Prague and Peter Zwicker. These two were commissioned to bring to trial or to\n    force the conversion of Waldensians through much of Europe. </big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>Their systematic effort began in Bavaria, continuing in the following year in the\n    region of Erfurt, and in 1392 in the province of Brandenberg. The inquisitors then\n    proceeded to Stettin, where they held a trial of 400 Waldensians. </big></p>\n    <p><big>Their reports speak of activities in various cities of what are now Germany,\n    Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and of their success in the city of Bern, Switzerland, in\n    getting 130 suspects to abjure heresy and return to the Church's fold. They reported a\n    similar success in Fribourg with some 50 Waldensians. </big></p>\n    <p><big>4. . . .in the latter part of the century the inquisition was resumed in full\n    intensity under the direction of a Franciscan, Francesco Borelli. So obsessed was this\n    monk with his pursuit of heretics that it was said that every prison from Embrun to\n    Avignon was full to overflowing. As a result, Pope Gregory IX himself had to appeal for\n    alms for the hapless prisoners.</big></p>\n    <p><big>5. . . . in 1450, the inquisitors were sent in to deal with Alpine dissidents. In\n    that year the whole valley of Luserna was placed under interdiction on the charge of\n    having resisted the authorities. </big></p>\n    <p><big>6. Another inquisitorial sweep took place in 1475, including interminable court\n    trials against anyone who failed to cooperate fully in the drive. . . .the counts of\n    Luserna themselves were. . . charged with being too lenient toward the Waldensians--for\n    which they were duly warned and subjected to heavy fines.</big></p>\n    <p><big>7. . . .Charles I at last called for full scale military action against the\n    dissidents, and was joined, from the French side, by the declaration of a crusade against\n    the Waldensians which lasted from 1487-89. The latter was directed by the infamous papal\n    legate, Alberta Cattaneo</big></p>\n    <p><big>. . . There the governor of Savoy, with the full consent of Charles VIII of\n    France, undertook a veritable and thorough going crusade against the hapless population.\n    As in other places and times in the Middle Ages, it was under the patronage of the Pope\n    and organized by his legate</big></p>\n    <p><big>. . .[the village of] Pragelato found itself squarely in the path of the\n    crusaders, so that it was invaded and sacked in the winter of 1487. A fate similar to that\n    of Pragelato was in store for the Waldensians in the valleys of Argentieres and Vallouise.\n    These folk had been consistently pacifist by tradition, so that they did not resist when\n    the invaders came. The crusaders then proceeded to level their villages, destroying every\n    trace of the Waldensians heritage.</big></p>\n    <p><big>8. Francis I. . .in 1545 named the president of Aix's parliament personally to\n    lead a papal army from Avignon to clear the area entirely of Waldensian presence. The\n    Luberon folk were suddenly caught in a vise. </big></p>\n    <p><big>. . .The mercenary soldiers engaged for the sweep did not stop until they had\n    devastated the whole region and obliterated every trace of the Waldensian villages. A few\n    survivors did manage to escape to Switzerland, but the lot of all the rest was either\n    death by the sword or life sentences as galley-slaves on French ships. </big></p>\n    <p><big>9. . . .On June 5, 1561, the town of San Sisto, with its 6,000 inhabitants, was\n    burned to the ground. </big></p>\n    <p><big>. . .Guardia Piemontese, its neighbor, was likewise destroyed. Prisoners were\n    burned like torches, sold as slaves to the Moors or condemned to die of starvation in the\n    dungeons of Cosenza. The massacre reached its height at Montalto Uffugo on June 11th. On\n    the steps in front of the parish church, 88 Waldensians were slaughtered one by one, like\n    animals brought to market.</big></p>\n    <p><big>10. If the military operation lasted only a few weeks, the work of Catholic\n    indoctrination, Jesuit style, continued for years. The Jesuits were determined to\n    obliterate every evidence that Waldensians had been present in Calabria. They almost\n    succeeded, except in one small respect: there is still a hint of the Provencal language in\n    the daily speech of the inhabitants.64</big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>The list of atrocities goes on and on, in fact far too long for detailed\nconsideration here.65 The point that becomes clear is that every effort was made on\nnumerous occasions to eliminate the Poor of Lyons in the customary way. At various points\nthis policy was close to final success. Yet, the Waldensian movement was never eliminated.\n</big></p>\n\n<p><big>Another tactic that was employed briefly with success by Pope Innocent III was to\ntake advantage of the differences between Waldo and the Lombards in 1208 to win the Poor\nMen back to the Church. Beginning in 1208 he encouraged the formation and spread of\nPauperes Catholici (\"Poor Catholics\") who under ecclesiastical direction would\nfollow such of the practices of the Waldenses as the Church could approve. By this means\nmany who had been attracted by the Poor Men were held or won back.66</big></p>\n\n<p><big>Nevertheless, the Waldensians continued to grow at a surprising rate. The pattern\nof growth appears to have been the result of systematic underground discipleship and\nwitnessing.</big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>. . .men and women, great and lesser, day and night do not cease to learn and\n    teach; the workman who labors all day teaches or learns at night . . .When someone has\n    been a student seven days, he seeks someone else to teach, as one curtain pulls another.\n    Whoever excuses himself, saying that he is not able to learn, they say to him, \"Learn\n    but one word each day, and after a year you will know three hundred, and you will\n    progress.\"67 </big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>Tourn has a remarkable map showing areas where Waldensians presence can be\ndocumented, reproduced here.68 </big></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/waldo.gif\" alt=\"waldo.gif (2920 bytes)\" width=\"204\"></p>\n\n<p><big>Map of Europe shows shaded patches all over western and some of eastern Europe</big></p>\n\n<p><big>In 1517 - the very year of Luther's protest--the Archbishop of Turin made record\nof a pastoral visit to the Alpine valleys in which he singled out for concern the ongoing\npresence of Waldensian groups practicing their faith.69</big></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/waldo1f.htm#Contents\"><big>Return to the Table of Contents</big></a></p>\n\n<h2><a name=\"Involvement\">Involvement</a> with the Hussites</h2>\n\n<p><big>When Jon Huss revolted against the authority of the Roman Catholic Church, it was\nnot another peasant revolt but a well reasoned attack aimed at the roots of papal\nauthority and doctrine. Huss was a scholar lecturing at the University of Prague. He\ntaught that the Bible was the sole authority for faith and practice, and salvation by\nfaith. He was promised safe conduct to the Council of Constance to answer for his views,\nbut was seized and burned at the stake anyway. At this point the population of sections of\nmodern Austria and Chechoslovakia rose in open revolt. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>One new twist in this revolt was that some fought when attacked by the inevitable\npapal army. In the same way that the Paulicians had earlier, they actually fought the\nRoman Catholic Church to a standstill in the 1400's. The fortress that they later formed\nat Tabor gave one group of them the name Taborites.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>When word of this revolution reached the Waldensians, they reacted with\nexcitement. They promptly dispatched several \"barbas\" (\"uncles\", the\nterm used by Waldensians for their teachers)70 to go to Bohemia and learn what was\nhappening. There followed a series of meetings between leaders of the two groups which led\nto great benefit for the Waldensians. They received from the Hussite movement training in\ntheology which was to prove very helpful to future generations.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>As a result, the barbas during this period were capable of reading theological\nworks in Latin, of studying mathematics, and knowing enough botany and rudimentary\nmedicine to permit them to deal with simple diseases. Their activity in ministerial tasks\nlikewise became more organized, rigorous and systematic than before. A young Waldensian\nwhose gifts and resolve marked him for service in the community would be apprenticed to an\nexperienced barba for a period of several years. After becoming familiar with the various\nplaces to visit, learning languages and studying the Bible more deeply, the young barba\nwould then visit the different clandestine scholae or underground schools.71 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>It is also interesting to note that although the Waldensians had almost always\nbeen pacifist, on one occasion they raised money for the Bohemian war chest. On another\noccasion, at Prali, a pitched battle between the local populace and the crusaders ended by\nCount Hugo pulling back his troops.72</big></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/waldo1f.htm#Contents\"><big>Return to the Table of Contents</big></a></p>\n\n<h2>The <a name=\"Reformation\">Reformation</a></h2>\n\n<p><big>Tourn states that, </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>Relentless inquisition, crusade and pillage had done their efficient work, so that\n    by the end of the 15th century a veil of silence hung over much of the Waldensian world.73</big></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>Yet the Waldensians still existed. By now, they were almost exclusively\nconcentrated in the Alpine valleys that had served as their main stronghold all along. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>When the reformation erupted in 1517, the Waldensians were eager to join forces\nwith the new fellow-revolutionists. We know that as early as the year 1526, a general\nassembly of Waldensians held at Laus, in the Chisone valley, was so eager to make personal\ncontact with the new movement that it made the decision to send a deputation across the\nAlps.74</big></p>\n\n<p><big>Luther, who so strongly denounced the Hussites at first, discovered during the\nLiepzig Disputation that he agreed with Huss. Later he said \"We were all Hussites\nwithout knowing it!\"75 Eventually, he wrote a preface to the Taborite Confession of\nFaith, in which he referred to the Hussites as \"Waldensians\".</big></p>\n\n<p><big>No official ties were forged between the Waldensians and the other Protestant\nChurches until 1532. In that year, the Synod of Chanforan was held, in which the\nWaldensians became a part of the reformed Church based in Geneva. For the Reformed, Farel\nled the negotiations, which were troubled, because of the Waldensian insistence on the\nseparation of church and state, as well as other doctrinal differences.76 The Swiss\nreformers also called on the Waldensians to put an end to confessions, fasts and\n\"meritorious Sundays,\" and to introduce an emphasis on the doctrine of\npredestination.77</big></p>\n\n<p><big>In the same year, the Geneva Reformers helped the Waldensians do a new translation\nof the Bible. The task was entrusted to Olivetan, a relative of Calvin's, who retired\nsecretly to a village in the Alps to do his work. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>The remarkable translation he produced (for which Calvin himself wrote the\nPreface) has come to be known as the \"Olivetan Bible,\" the first of the French\nReformation. Printed in Neuchatel, it was delivered to the Waldensians in 1535.78</big></p>\n\n<p><big>Many of their worst trials, including massacres, were still ahead of them in 1532,\nbut they were now a part of an international movement. Because they were no longer alone\nas an isolated sect, and because their doctrine was essentially reformed, they pass beyond\nthe scope of this study.</big></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/waldo1f.htm#Contents\"><big>Return to the Table of Contents</big></a></p>\n\n<h2><a name=\"Conclusions\">Conclusions</a></h2>\n\n<p><big>It is questionable whether the Waldensians ever exceeded 100,000 functional\nmembers at any one time before the Reformation. Yet when one considers that they existed\nin some force for almost 350 years before the reformation began, it is evident that many\ngenerations, and therefore many times their total were affected.</big></p>\n\n<p><big>No one knows, even roughly, the total number killed in the persecutions the\nWaldensians endured, but the lowest estimates must run into the several tens of thousands.\nIt is unlikely that any group other than the Anabaptists and Jews can point to a\ncomparable history of prolonged universal persecution. Their amazing survival makes them\ndifferent, than the other schizmatic groups that began at the same time as well. The crime\nwhich precipitated such suffering was their desire to exercise their birthright in the\nBody of Christ according to the New Testament--the practice of their own gifts and\nministries</big></p>\n\n<p><big>The Waldensian Church still exists today in several locations.79 Unfortunately,\nthe fusion with the Reformed Church has not resulted in the rapid ferment of outreach that\nonce characterized the movement. Nevertheless, the fact that they remain in existence at\nall is a strong testimony, and perhaps a galling reminder to some, that the effort to\ndisenfranchise the laity from their right to minister will be frustrated by the power of\nthe Holy Spirit Himself. </big></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/waldo1f.htm#Contents\"><big>Return to the Table of Contents</big></a></p>\n\n<h2><a name=\"Bibliography\">Bibliography</a></h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><big>Cameron, Euan. <em>The Reformation of the Heretics: The Waldenses of the Alps</em>,\n    1480-1580.

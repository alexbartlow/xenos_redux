How do we help her \n        get to that point? </p>\n      <p>During one of our regular times together with this young believer we \n        might tell her that we've been thinking about how God can use her to reach \n        the lost. We ask her if she has thought similarly. Draw her out on how \n        she sees God working through her in evangelism. </p>\n      <p>The POINT is for her to see this area as GOD does, not as you do. Direct \n        her toward passages that speak of God's perspective in evangelism. She \n        must understand and agree upon its importance from <i>God's </i>perspective, \n        not just because you are saying it.</p>\n      <p>She might already have some convictions in this area, but be prepared \n        to add to her vision if needed and communicate it with passion and excitement. \n        Incorporate what you know about her to show how her life can look in this \n        area. This vision might draw on her uniqueness: how God has spiritually \n        gifted her, her personality traits, opportunities she has, observations \n        you've made, experiences she has had in evangelism (including talking \n        about who reached out to her). </p>\n      <p>By doing this, you set the stage for a grace-oriented discussion regardless \n        of her response to your initiative. Too often, leaders and workers start \n        the discussion with the next step in this model, omitting this important \n        part. </p>\n      <p><b><i>If she doesn't see this goal or vision for her life, go no further \n        at this time</i>.</b> There is no sense in moving toward an honest assessment \n        of her own shortcomings, if she doesn't agree on the goal or believe it \n        is important. Ask her to pray, study the scriptures, and get input from \n        other Christians about the subject. Be willing to engage her again on \n        the topic in the relatively near future.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li value=\"2\">\n      <p><b><i>Honest introspection: </i></b>Now \n        it's time to ask how she thinks she is doing compared to what she believes \n        are God's goals in evangelism (which they just articulated in #1). Be \n        careful to stay away from a legalistic finger-wagging session here. Allow \n        her to provide her own assessment; ask questions about why it is that \n        way, does she understand how God's grace covers any problems in this area, \n        etc. Often the worker is surprised by how clearly the person sees their \n        weaknesses without us elaborating! </p>\n      <p>It is very important to also positively affirm any strides they have \n        made in the subject being discussed. It is often the discipler who has \n        to remind the younger Christian where they have seen positive steps. </p>\n      <p>But overall, you have brought up the subject because you believe there \n        needs to be more positive movement and now <i>might be </i>the time in \n        this conversation to point out what you have or haven't seen that needs \n        to change, adding to what she has said, or broaching what she doesn't \n        see as a problem at all. </p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>\"Might be\" because ideally, they come up with most of what \n          you have noticed without you telling them in the early part of this \n          step. In that case, you still should agree that you have the same concerns.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p>But, often the person only sees part of the picture and you'll need to \n        provide a more detailed picture of the concerns. It is key that you communicate \n        with an attitude of grace and vision where the person can be if there \n        is growth in this weak area.</p>\n      <p>Be specific, and objective when possible, about your concerns. In our \n        example about weak outreach you might say something like: \"I agree \n        that you don't spend enough time building relationships with non-Christians. \n        Do you think your work schedule of 60-80 hours per week is related to \n        this? Are your values and priorities matching what you claim you'd like \n        to do in serving God?\" \"How do you relate 1 John 2:15,16 to \n        the problem?\" Or perhaps the lack of outreach is because they are \n        afraid of rejection, and this is exposed at this time. </p>\n      <p><b><i>If she was willing to acknowledge the goal or vision (#1), but \n        not where her problems lie in respect to that vision, there is no sense \n        going any further</i>.</b> Ask her to think and pray through the concerns \n        you've described, and perhaps to ask other Christians for their input \n        on the subject as well. Give the Lord time to work and have follow-up \n        discussions with her. </p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>You will have to regulate the frequency of follow-up discussions based \n          on the subject of concern. If it is highly damaging to her or others, \n          potentially dangerous or very serious sin, there is call to move quickly \n          and frequently. However, most issues although needing to change, require \n          some prayerful consideration by the person (like the example we are \n          describing about developing an evangelism lifestyle), and it would be \n          inappropriate to badger her about this every time you get with her.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p>If she has \"owned\" the first two parts, then she is experiencing \n        what we hoped for &#x97; tension.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p><b><i>Tension: </i></b>Tension results if \n        she has processed the vision and goals for her life in this area, AND \n        honestly admitted where she lacks in respect to that vision. Schein states \n        that it is the discomfort, guilt, or shame feelings that come when our \n        equilibrium has been disrupted. </p>\n      <p>At this point, she has agreed with God's priority for every Christian \n        to be part of and acknowledged she should be part of the plan. She has \n        also admitted she is not living out that vision (including probably providing \n        specific examples). The resulting tension provides the proper motivation \n        to develop and act on a God-empowered plan (next step) for change.</p>\n      <p>If there is no tension, then either she does not actually have the problem \n        you thought you discerned, or she hasn't actually come to grips with #1 \n        and/or #2. <b><i>If this is the case, there is no sense in going to the \n        next step. It is time to return to #1 or #2, or both. Encourage her to \n        review what you have talked about, pray, and ask other mature Christians \n        that know her what they think.</i></b></p>\n      <p>But, assuming there is a proper tension, or \"discomfort\", it \n        is time for the next exciting step.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p><b><i>Plan for Change: </i></b>This newly \n        motivated Christian needs a plan for change! It should be clear direction, \n        doable (not asking too much for where the person is in their walk), practical, \n        and in the power of God. </p>\n      <p>Obviously, the worker should have thought this through beforehand (Hebrews \n        10:24), including getting advice if needed, so that he can provide solid \n        help. But during the discussion the person getting help should be encouraged \n        to think through a plan for herself before the worker gives their input. \n        We should give him time to continue to think this through and write their \n        ideas down over the next week or so. This is where teaching the basics \n        on walking in the power of the Spirit is essential. You may want to refer \n        her to the <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/cpu2w8.htm\">Christian Principles</a> \n        overview on this subject.</p>\n      <p>It is tempting to think that the job is done at this stage, but for two \n        reasons it is not. First, even if the person begins to act on the plan \n        for change, your follow-up help, reminders, and prayer will be instrumental. \n        It takes time, particularly for more substantive areas, to become a way \n        of life. And second.....</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p><b><i>Count the Cost: </i></b> Now that \n        she sees exactly the plan entails, and the cost (EG. priority changes, \n        lifestyle sacrifice, financial sacrifice, humility to admit wrong, etc.) \n        she might question if she really wants to change. It is part of \"counting \n        the cost\" that Christ requires in Luke 14:27-31. If she begins to \n        vacillate in her commitment to change, encourage her to rethink the vision \n        for this area; to understand again what God's perspective is. Is this \n        what she really <i>want</i>s regardless of the work ahead?</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Helping People & Home Groups through Change","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/motivating_change.htm"}

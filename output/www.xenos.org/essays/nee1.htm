His Little Flock movement\n  was more influential in planting house churches throughout China than many realize. His\n  career also demonstrates some of the problems the church can inherit when patriotism is\n  confused with Christianity</h3>\n<h5>1986</h5>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Introduction</h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">From the time China was opened to western visitors in 1973 we have heard a growing\nstream of reports increasing in their excitement, about house churches there. At first,\nvisitors claimed that, against all odds, the house church movement was still intact after\n25 years of persecution.1 After several years, however, the reports became more sanguine.\nEstimates appeared claiming that there were 30 million authentic Christians meeting in\nhouse churches.2 Later estimates went higher still to 50 million and beyond.3 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">We can appreciate these figures when we contrast them to the estimated total number of\nChristians before the revolution of 1949. Most authorities estimate that there were less\nthan one million evangelicals, but certainly, no more than two million before the\ncommunist takeover.4 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">These reports are amazing because during the past 30 years the Chinese church has lived\nunder acute persecution, probably as harsh as that of any church in the world. Estimates\nof those killed go into the millions.5 In addition, virtually the entire evangelical\nChinese-Christian intelligentsia was destroyed or silenced. Therefore, by even the most\nconservative estimates, the Chinese church must be considered one of the most victorious\nin the world. During a thirty five year period when the church in the developed countries\nhas not experienced any significant growth at all, and in many places has decreased in\nsize, the Chinese church has grown at least twenty, and perhaps fifty-fold. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">It seems today that most of the ferment of growth in China is occurring, not in the\nGovernment sanctioned \"Three-Self Patriotic Movement\" (TSPM) churches, but in\nless organized and illegal house churches. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Standing at the headwaters of much of this spiritual ferment is a shadowy figure to\nwestern eyes. He is an enigma, and a paradox, but unquestionably one of the great\nChristian workers of this century-- Watchman Nee.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Biographical Background</h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Watchman Nee was born Ni Shu-tsu or Henry Ni in Swatow, November 4, 1903. He was later\nrenamed Ni Ching-Fu, and finally, after his commitment to Christian work, Ni\nTo-sheng--that is, Watchman Nee. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">His father, Ni Weng-hsiu or Nga Ung-siu of Foochow, born in 1877, was the fourth of\nnine boys. He served as officer in the Imperial Customs Service and died in Hong Kong in\n1941. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Like so many well known servants of God, Watchman Nee had a family heritage of\nChristian Service. The first school in Foochow offering western-style education was opened\nin a suburb of the old city in 1853, and it was here that Watchman Nee's grandfather Nga\nU-cheng heard of Jesus Christ and was won to Him. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Four years later in 1857, the year in which the first Christian church in Foochow came\ninto being, he was one of a group of four pupils baptized in the Min River. He progressed\nso well that the missionaries trained him as an evangelist, and soon he was proclaiming\nthe gospel in this city of half a million souls. Eventually he was ordained a pastor, the\nfirst Chinese to be so honored in the three north Fukien missions. He had a gift for\nexpounding the Scriptures for which, after his death in 1890, he was long to be\nremembered. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The strongest influence in Nee's early ideological development seems to have been his\nmother Lin Huo-ping.6 Her early experience included being sold as a slave to another\ncouple in Foochow by her parents who could no longer afford to feed her. These in turn\nsold her to a wealthier merchant as an adopted daughter. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Huo-ping is portrayed by Kinnear as a strong-willed woman who became belatedly, but\ndeeply committed to Christ and the Scriptures.7 She seems to have been mentally gifted,\neasily excelling the other students in the western style school in which she studied-- the\nChinese Western Girls School in Shanghai. She had been deeply influenced by Huo King-en,\nwho was at that time only the second women in China to have graduated in medicine in the\nU.S. Huo-ping prevailed on her father to work towards sending her to the U.S. to study\nmedicine as well. Another gifted woman who affected Huo-ping at this time was Dora Yu, who\nhad also been selected to study abroad, but had felt called of God to return from Europe\nto preach in China instead. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Before Huo-ping could carry out her plans, her mother accepted a marriage contract with\nNga Ung-siu (Nee's father, who was later renamed Ni Wheng-hsiu by the civil service). It\nwas inconceivable at that time for her to violate an agreement entered into with full\nparental authority. With bitterness of heart, she submitted to the inevitable. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Her marriage, which seems to have turned out alright after all, issued in nine\nchildren. While raising them, Huo- ping became active in patriotic activities associated\nwith Sun Yat-sen. She was a tireless political organizer and agitator, forming the Women's\nPatriotic Society and often speaking publicly. When Sun Yat-sen came to Foochow in 1913,\nshe was given an official role in the reception. Eventually she was awarded the order of\nthe Second Class for Patriotism by the Kuomintang government.8 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">When, in 1919, she committed her life to Christ, she became active in evangelistic\npreaching, and her political activities diminished. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee2.htm\" target=\"_self\">Read on to the next section of Nee and the House\nChurch Movement</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=watchman\">Ask Dennis a\nquestion or share a comment.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Go back to the Essays page</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Go back to the Xenos home page</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Watchman Nee and the House Church Movement in China I","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/nee1.htm"}

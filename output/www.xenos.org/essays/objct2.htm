When any attempt is made to turn symbols into bare\n  statements of truth, this vital trigger of the emotions can easily be lost.\"10 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Norbeck points out that ritual and the designation of sacred space enable the simple\nlayman to \"participate\" in a way that is meaningful to him.11 </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The remarkable thing about these observations is that some of the greatest\n  religions began with very little objectification, but seem to have invariably developed it\n  later.\"12 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We wonder; if people have so much trouble relating to abstraction, why did these\nreligious systems ever take root in the first place? Sometimes objectification has even\nbeen against the teachings of the founder of a religion, but nevertheless present in later\npractice. Norbeck points out that sometimes the great religions themselves have had strict\nrules against certain forms of objectification, \"but the concrete has usually had a\nluxuriant growth along other avenues.\" For example, Muslims were not allowed to\nvenerate pictures of Muhammad, but they quickly learned to venerate a piece of paper with\nhis name written on it.13 </p>\n\n<p>Thus, even when the founder of a religious system has decreed rules to prevent common\nforms of objectification, worshipers have found ways around those rules. </p>\n\n<p>Christianity contains examples of this as well. Christ's declaration that people should\nworship God \"...neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem...but in Spirit and\ntruth...\" was largely ignored in favor of older ideas of \"sanctuary\" and\n\"the house of God\" (that is to say, sacred space).14 </p>\n\n<p>Wallace explains the tendency in religious man this way, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"An organism overwhelmed by information overload is incapable of discriminating\n  response; ritual, by reducing the information content of experience below the often\n  bewildering level of complexity and disorder with which reality confronts him, permits\n  adaptive response.\"15 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All these authors agree that the common man is not capable of handling pure abstraction\nwell. Instead, they see religious man bypassing the \"understanding\" stage, and\ngoing directly (through vehicles of objectification) to a simpler relationship with the\nsacred.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Theory 2: Sacred Space as a Vehicle for Heirophany Stimulation </h3>\n\n<p>Mercea Eliade has developed some very stimulating theories regarding sacred space in\nhis book, <i>Patterns In Comparative Religion</i>. First, he points out that man has\nalways set apart areas as sacred. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The enclosure, wall, or circle of stones surrounding a sacred place- these are\n  among the most ancient of known forms of man-made sanctuary. They existed as early as the\n  early Indus civilization (at Mohenjo-Dara, for instance) and the Aegean\n  civilization.\"16 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Eliade's observes that these sacred areas relate to some <i>heirophany</i>. A\n\"Heirophany\" is a manifestation of, or an encounter with, the sacred. He also\nnotes that many religious systems consider their sacred space(s) to be the center of the\nworld. This is true for some, but relatively few sacred spaces that occurred there once.17\nCommemoration of heirophanies must indeed be the basis for selecting many of the worlds\nsacred places. </p>\n\n<p>Eliade goes beyond this however, to assert the intriguing idea that, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The heirophany therefore does not merely sanctify a given segment of\n  undifferentiated profane space; it goes so far as to ensure that sacredness will continue\n  there. There, in that place, the heirophany repeats itself.\"18 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here we begin to sense the presence of something else. Not simply the inability of\nsimple people to understand or hold dear abstract truths, but an attempt to stimulate an\nevent that is not available elsewhere. In other words, the holy place is not there simply\nto <i>explain </i>(or objectify) abstract concepts, but to enable the worshiper to <i>provoke\n</i>(or invoke) a spiritual event or blessing that is not available even one foot outside\nof the sacred space! </p>\n\n<p>This seems to square with many western religious sacred space designations. The\ncathedral, church, mosque, etc. is not necessarily the scene of a historical heirophany,\nbut it is more likely to provide one now. Therefore it would be a good idea, in the minds\nof many, to go down to the church to pray or worship, rather than to simply do so at home.\nChapels are provided at hospitals so people can pray for the sick, rather than simply\npraying for them in their rooms. </p>\n\n<p>Thus with the notion of sacred space, we may have an attempt to <i>regularize </i>and\nperhaps to <i>control </i>heirophany. </p>\n\n<p>Turner agrees that objectification through sacred space gives man control of sacred\nexperience, and adds that the same is true of sacred times: \"Similarly periodic\nrituals re-enact and so renew the actions of the gods.\"19 </p>\n\n<p>Here then, sacred time designations also serve the same function as do sacred space.\nThis idea is supplemented, according to Eliade, by the further notion of protection from\nthe sacred. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"(the dividing structure between sacred and profane space)...also serves the\n  purpose of preserving profane man from the danger to which he would expose himself by\n  entering it without due care. The sacred is always dangerous to anyone who comes into\n  contact with it unprepared, without having gone through the \"gestures of\n  approach\" that every religious act demands.\"20 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Therefore there is both a positive and a negative element present in the practice of\ndesignating space as sacred. On the positive side, an increased likelihood of a divine\nresponse to the worshiper. On the negative side, a clear boundary between the safety of\nthe profane, and the danger of the sacred. There is <i>containment </i>of the sacred here,\nalong with <i>limitation </i>and <i>control</i>. To view it differently, sacred space not\nonly enables us to <i>approach </i>the deity more easily, it also enables us to <i>leave </i>his\npresence afterward. </p>\n\n<p>This could be considered a functional explanation for sacred space, as opposed to the\ndidactic explanation favored, to some extent, by Norbeck and Davies. Here it seems that\nEliade has the better (or fuller) explanation. The ideas of containment and control in\nturn lead to connections with other concepts often excluded from the idea of\nreligion-namely, magic and fetishism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/objct_a.htm\">Go back to the Objectification table of contents</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Ask Dennis a question or share\na comment.</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\">Go back to the Essays page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/objct3.htm\">Read on to the next section in \"Objectification\"</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Go back to the Xenos home page</a> </p>\n\n<p>Send Dennis a comment or question  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Objectification Of Religion: Universal Themes II","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/objct2.htm"}

Sudden changes in subject are unusual. If you have\n    the thought development of a book centering on one subject, suddenly switching to another,\n    and then back to the first, your interpretation is almost certainly wrong.<br>\n    <br>\n    Consider the larger context as well: which Testament? which author? what time period?\n    Never view a passage in isolation from its surroundings. The context should be considered\n    the most important kind of evidence in the interpretation of a passage. Usually context\n    supplies all we need to know. We should turn to other explanations only when we can find\n    no critically feasible interpretation based on the English text in context. Anyone who\n    claims to see a break in context bears the full burden of proof. <ul>\n      <li>- Mt. 16:28 - Referring to the transfiguration (in context of passage) </li>\n      <li>- I Cor. 14:34 - Means to disrupt (see I Cor. 11:5 - context of book and passage) </li>\n      <li>- I Cor. 3:17 (thought development of the passage limits interpretation) </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><b>Interpret in light of progressive revelation</b>(Heb. 1:1,2). While God's purpose for\n    man has never changed, His strategy in accomplishing that purpose has changed. He has\n    dealt with man under different \"covenants,\" or programs. Therefore, it is\n    important to ask \"Under which program was this written?.\" Primary application of\n    the passage will be to the people operating under that program, but not necessarily to\n    others. There may be secondary applications for other programs based on principles which\n    have universal application. Note special problems here in connection with the ministry of\n    Christ before the cross. <ul>\n      <li>- Polygamy was permitted in the Old Testament, but taught against in the New Testament\n        (I Tim. 3:2) </li>\n      <li>- Theocracy was commanded in Old Testament, but secular government is affirmed in the\n        New Testament. (Rom. 13:1-7; Mt. 22:21; IIChron. 7:14) </li>\n      <li>- Animal sacrifices, dietary laws, Sabbaths, holy days, festivals, priests and liturgy\n        have all been fulfilled in Christ and are thus obsolete (Col. 2:16,17; Heb. 8). </li>\n      <li>- Mal. 3:7-12 - in context of the testament (see Num. 18:21-24; Deut. 14:22-29) </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><b>Interpret scripture in harmony with other scripture</b> Since the Bible is inspired\n    by God, it does not contradict itself. Therefore, never interpret scripture in such a way\n    that it clearly contradicts other scriptures. First discover the allowable range of\n    meaning for a passage, then choose the interpretation that doesn't contradict other\n    scriptures. <ul>\n      <li>- Acts 2:38 could either be referring to baptismal regeneration, or simply adding\n        baptism as a desirable adjunct to the minimum requirement for salvation (i.e. faith). </li>\n      <li>- Jas. 2:14-26 \"justify\" can also mean \"justify before men.\" </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><b>Interpret the unclear in light of the clear</b>. Scripture teaches every major,\n    essential truth clearly and many times. Never build a doctrine on an unclear passage. <ul>\n      <li>- Lk. 16:9 is used by Roman Catholics to support indulgences. </li>\n      <li>- I Cor. 15:29 mentions an obscure, unknown practice used in Corinth. Today the Mormon\n        church uses this passage to elevate dead ancestors to a higher status in the afterlife. </li>\n      <li>- I John 5:16 The sin unto death is never defined. Don't base a doctrine of falling away\n        on such a passage. </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><b>Interpret the \"spirit\" of the passage, not necessarily the\n    \"letter\", or the literalistic meaning, especially when the text is a literary\n    genre prone to figures of speech or colorful statements</b>. <ul>\n      <li>- Proverbs 22:6 The book of Proverbs contains many general maxims, but not all are\n        absolute promises. Not every child will go right, but most will. </li>\n      <li>- Proverbs 15:1 Not every gentle word will turn away wrath, but in most cases it will. </li>\n      <li>- I Cor. 11:1-18 - In some New Testament passages interpretation by the\n        \"letter\" contradicts the \"spirit\" of the passage (c.f. I Cor.\n        10:32,33). </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><b>Interpret with dependence upon the Holy Spirit, allowing Him to teach you.</b> Mark T\n    or F. <ul>\n      <li>- Proverbs 3:5 \"Lean not unto your own understanding\" means we should avoid\n        approaching the Bible on a primarily analytical level. </li>\n      <li>- Since the Bible is \"living and active\", the interpretation of a passage may\n        be different for different people. </li>\n      <li>- Unless we approach God's word with a deep reverence for God and a passion to know His\n        will for our lives, we may often get the wrong interpretation. </li>\n      <li>- If the rules of interpretation give one answer and the Holy Spirit shows another, we\n        should choose the latter. </li>\n      <li>- We should pray before studying that God will enable us to understand the passage.<br>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Grammatical-Historical Hermeneutics For Lay Readers","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/herme.htm"}

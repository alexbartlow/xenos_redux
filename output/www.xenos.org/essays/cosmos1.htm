According to Donald MacKay \"it is never too easy to\n    distinguish hard scientific data from the philosophical extrapolations from them which are\n    put about in the name of Science.\" Similarly it is often difficult to distinguish the\n    true meaning of biblical scriptures from the philosophical extrapolations that are put\n    about in the name of Christianity. A classic illustration of the conflict between theology\n    and scientific cosmology is given by the following example:</p>\n    \n    <p>In 1615 a conflict arose between Galileo Galilei and the Roman Catholic Church. A\n    priest named Niccolo Lorini sent a letter to the Inquisitors-General in Rome expressing\n    his concern that the followers of Galileo \"were taking upon themselves to expound the\n    Holy Scriptures according to their private lights,...<i>that they were trampling underfoot\n    all of Aristotle's philosophy</i>....I believe that the Galilieans are orderly men and all\n    good Christians, but a little wise and cocky in their opinions.\" </p>\n    \n    <p>Although the conflict focussed on interpretation of scripture it was the underlying\n    philosophical foundation of the interpretations that produced the conflict. In this case\n    the official Church doctrine was aligned with the philosophy of Aristotle. It was the\n    conclusions drawn from Aristotle's view of cosmology that Galileo challenged and not the\n    biblical view. </p>\n    <p>This then is the principal thesis to be developed here: the conflicts between theology\n    and science on the subject of cosmology are generally rooted in either opposing\n    philosophical views or philosophical confusions between the data and their interpretation.\n    It is proposed that theology and science are both tainted with their own unstated\n    philosophical presuppositions (either unwittingly or deceptively by the theologian and\n    scientist) thus affecting their various interpretations of cosmology. If the Christian\n    view point holds science to represent truth revealed by God through nature and scripture\n    to represent truth provided through God's special revelation, then the two\n    \"truths\" cannot be contradictory. This does not necessitate a natural theology,\n    nor preclude it, but it does require nature and revelation to make compatible statements. </p>\n    \n    <h3>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEOLOGY AND SCIENCE</h3>\n    \n    <p>There is generally held to be a dichotomous relationship between science and religion.\n    As discussed in the introduction the description of physical events falls under the\n    purview of science while explanation of the significance of events is often considered to\n    be the domain of religion. In this sense the activities of these two fields have at times\n    been considered to be mutually exclusive. While science and religion may claim some\n    exclusivity they also by nature of their activity and claims have a domain where they must\n    interact. Thus if one is to make a broad statement about the relationship between science\n    and religion, and particularly on the specific subject of cosmology, it would be more\n    accurate to describe them as complementary. If we ascribe rational qualities to both\n    science and religion then it is impossible to maintain that they are mutually exclusive\n    with respect to their statements about the nature of events. The complementary nature of\n    theology and science does not mean that the two cannot make contradictory statements\n    provided one or both are in error. Nor does this mean that one can always have it both\n    ways by invoking complementarity to declare opposing statements only have the\n    \"appearance\" of contradiction. Thus the question remains; what is the\n    relationship between scientific cosmology and biblical cosmology? </p>\n    <p>To properly address conflicts between biblical and scientific cosmologies one must\n    establish if a proper relationship between theology and science exists and, if so, the\n    relationship must be defined. There are four sharply contrasting views regarding this\n    relationship:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><b>concordist</b> - scientific and theological views are interpretative methodologies\n        that carry equal weight and their conclusions must be reconciled, </li>\n      <li><b>purely religious</b> - this view asserts science and theology are unrelated and thus\n        there are no interactions between the two views, </li>\n      <li><b>complementarity</b> - there is a scientific language necessary to describe events in\n        the physical world and a religious language necessary to describe events associated with\n        higher levels of consciousness, </li>\n      <li><b>dogmatism</b> - scientific views hold greater authority and refute the theological\n        views where there is a contradiction (scientific dogmatism, usually an atheistic\n        contention) or scientific views must be made to submit to and support the theological\n        views (religious dogmatism). \n        <p>The concordist view requires biblical and scientific interpretations to harmonize. This\n        view admits possible contradictions and attempts to resolve them. The purely religious\n        view claims science and religion are mutually exclusive domains of study and cannot\n        legitimately interact. Any contradictions arising between theology and science are\n        pseudo-problems arising from one discipline trespassing on the other's proper domain.\n        Complementarity asserts that theology and science are addressing different levels of one\n        underlying reality. Complementary descriptions of reality on occasion gives rise to the\n        appearance of theological and scientific contradictions. However these\n        pseudo-contradictions occur because of confusions that arise when the predicates used by\n        the two distinct languages (theological versus scientific) to describe each level of\n        existence are mixed. Dogmatism is an appeal to the authority of one interpretative scheme\n        over the other. Scientific atheists and religious fundamentalists tend to hold this view.\n        The relationship between science and theology adopted in the following discussion is one\n        of moderate concordism and complementarity. We avoid dogmatism because there is\n        substantial evidential basis for the validity of both scientific and theological\n        methodologies. The purely religious view is avoided because it tends to produce a\n        dualistic view that implies the physical aspects of life are irrelevant to spiritual\n        concerns and vice versa. This leads to noninteracting spiritual and physical worlds which\n        is contrary to the biblical theme concerning the relationship between God and man.</p>\n        <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos1.htm#Footnote1A\" name=\"Footnote1B\">Footnote1</a></p>\n        <p>1.

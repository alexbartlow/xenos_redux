He also points out that one of Dannhauer's \n              pet projects which never came to realization was the founding of \n              a seminary for teaching foreign languages to prepare missionaries \n              for assignments.

For example, \"Every person \n              reading the Scriptures must first pay attention how the verses fit \n              together and then pay attention to each individual word. Various \n              parts of the Scripture must be compared with one another. . .not \n              too much typological or allegorical understanding. . .

Valentine Weigel was a mystical author and Lutheran pastor \n              who turned out to be a theosophist when his private works were published \n              posthumously. He was therefore completely discredited in the minds \n              of orthodox Lutherans, and his name was a synonym for mystical heresy. \n            </p>\n            <p>Quakers were likewise a symbol of religious extremism in Germany \n              at this time.

Pietists: Selected Writings, p. 84. \"resignation\" \n              for Spener seems to be exactly parallel to the notion of \"surrender\" \n              so familiar to modern evangelicals, as well as late medieval mystics. \n              The disturbing implication of passivity need not be a problem, because \n              Spener qualifies himself completely. </p>\n            <p>131Henry Suso (c. 1295-1366) in The Library of Christian Classics, \n              Vol. VII, Late Medieval Mysticism, pp. 252-258. </p>\n            <p>132Henry Suso (c. 1295-1366) in Late Medieval Mysticism, p. 61. \n            </p>\n            <p>133Rufus M.

Yet \n              he is not entirely convincing. The elements he mentions as belonging \n              to Boehmism include;<br>\n              \"The Christian is to have no sect. . .\" (19) This could \n              also have come from an idealistic reading of many passages in the \n              Bible (Eph. 4:3ff). There are certainly many modern theologians \n              who have this view without reference to Boehme.<br>\n              \"Predestination to damnation was a blasphemous idea,\" \n              (20) but Spener and many others (such as the Quakers) thought the \n              same thing.<br>\n              \"One must `put on Christ' and experience the `process' of the \n              incarnation within one's self,\" (20) but it is sometimes a \n              fine line between this language and Pauline notions of identification \n              with Christ (II Cor. 4:7-18). The process idea is also typical of \n              other German mystics. Lordship theology was typical of all pietists.<br>\n              \"Sophia mysticism,\" Ensign admits is \"a variation \n              on the typical medieval love-phantasy theme, based on the Song of \n              Solomon.\" (20,21) Indeed this theme was very common in the \n              medieval period, as well as after the reformation (see \"Other \n              Arndtians\" below). Besides, Ensign admits, \"some [radical \n              pietists] abstained from either of these sentimental cults,\" \n              (21).<br>\n              \"Celibacy as a spiritually more desirable state than marriage,\" \n              (21) but this was hardly new with Boehme. One need never have heard \n              of Boehme to have this view, which had dominated the middle ages, \n              and is clearly evident in the earliest monastic writers. <br>\n              \"Religion should not be controlled in any way by the state,\" \n              (21) but this was the automatic cry of all those who were being \n              persecuted by the state for Religion.<br>\n              Finally, Ensign not only admits, \"Other origins may be found \n              for many, if not most, of these ideas. . .Boehme himself was a part \n              of the mystical-spiritualist tradition.\" p. 21, but also \"They \n              [the radical pietists] did not consider themselves Boehmists as \n              such in most instances,\" and \"Writers presenting Boehme's \n              ideas rarely acknowledged their dependence on him.\" p. 21. \n              <br>\n              One must ask at this point whether sufficient value is left of the \n              theory when it is so qualified that virtually nothing remains? Unless \n              there is other material that was not produced, this author remains \n              unconvinced that Boehme is the main source of the radical's theology. \n              <br>\n            </p>\n            <p>This is not to say that he was not an influence at all. We know \n              that Gichtel was a Boehmist. He said, \". . .I must acknowledge \n              that [Boehme's] writings gave been to me of more service for the \n              understanding of the Bible than all my University learning.\" \n              cited in Rufus M. Jones, Spiritual Reformers in the 16th and 17th \n              Centuries, p. 153. And we can place Gichtel in direct influence \n              of Gottfried Arnold, and probably Hochman. However, does this mean \n              that Arnold's teachings are simply Boehmist? The fact must be reckoned \n              with that virtually all of these ideas were rife in the intellectual \n              climate of Germany at this time, leading this author to feel that \n              Ensign is over-simplifying the issue.

Although, as we have seen, \n              Spener spoke of the Lutheran church as the true church, he did \"approach \n              a spiritualistic view of the church in his distinction between true \n              heart Religion and Lutheran formalism, as did Francke in his differentiation \n              between the converted and unconverted. p. 46. </p>\n            <p>174Dale Brown, Understanding Pietism, p. 46. </p>\n            <p>175Anon, \"Theologia Germanica,\" in Late Medieval Mysticism, \n              p. 336. </p>\n            <p>176Stoeffler adds, \"The difficulty here is that Luther by \n              insisting on salvation sola fide and, at the same time, on a rigidly \n              objective interpretation of baptism bequeathed to posterity what \n              comes close to a logical contradiction.

Noll thinks that Pietism \n              was \"in one sense the Christian answer to. . .`the discovery \n              of the individual' by providing a Christian form to the individualism \n              and practical-mindedness of a Europe in transition to modern times. \n              . .Both the Enlightenment and Pietism asserted the rights of individuals, \n              opposed the protestant hierarchy, and were concerned about practice \n              more than theory. The question remains as to whether Pietism paved \n              the way for a similar secular expression of these themes.\" \n              p. 858. This observation deserves consideration, but may be superficial. \n              The points of contact could be coincidental, and do not necessarily \n              stem from the same basis. On the other hand, once individualism \n              took root, it would not be impossible for it to become a habit, \n              even though the reason changes. </p>\n            <p>239These include Karl Barth, Ernst Troeltsch, Paul Tillich, Rienhold \n              Niebuhr, and Emil Brunner. All argue that Pietism tended to lead \n              to individualistic subjectivism, and lack of concern for social \n              conditions because the inner life was focused on exclusive of the \n              outer life.

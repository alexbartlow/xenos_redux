He owes his importance partly to the epoch in which he wrote, and to the\nimposing form of his work. He is often incorrect, credulous, and carried away by his\nfeeling; but the latter fault was almost inevitable in a contemporary author, himself the\nvictim of the events which he records.

This source takes cognizance of all of the critical findings that I\nhave been able to locate. Tourn seems to be very judicious in his use of the sources,\nrejecting Waldensian legends, even though he is a Waldensian pastor. He should however, be\ncriticized for down-playing the influence of dualistic asceticism on Waldensian doctrine,\nand perhaps for the use of one source that did not appear in other literature. </p>\n\n<p>12The Chronicler was Richard, Monk of Cluny, \"Rerum Italicarum Scriptores\",\ntom.iii, p. 447 et seq.

This source says he had met\nseveral times the later translator. Writing in the early 1200's, he would be considered a\ngood source. He describes the excommunication of <i>The Waldensians</i>, and their\npractice of changing disguises frequently (from cobbler to merchant etc.) as they traveled\naround, to avoid detection. </p>\n\n<p>16This short description by Mapes \"De Nugis Curialium,\" one of the earliest\nreference to <i>The Waldensians</i>, is among the manuscripts of the Bodleian Library\n(851) at Oxford. Mapes goes on to relate that they were forbidden to teach, and concludes,\n\"Naked, they follow a naked Christ.

While many no doubt were\nilliterate, it is likely that for others, their illiteracy consisted of inability to read\nlanguages other than Provencal. </p>\n\n<p>For an example of the logic used to reject their right to preach, see F.

However, they probably were influenced by the Paulicians\nand the Bogomils, who were from the Balkan region. So, Kenneth Scott Latourette, <i>A\nHistory of Christianity </i>Volume I: to A.D. 1500, (New York: Harper &amp; Row\nPublishers, 1975) p. 454.

Biller shows that the rite of entry to the brotherhood included the\n\"profession of the three monastic vows. . .greater strictness [than other mendicant\norders] . . .a requirement of virginity, not just celibacy in a candidate, automatic\nexpulsion for a sexual lapse, a longer period of probation after profession of vows,\ntwelve years in one case. . .\" Peter Biller, \"Multum Ieiunantes et se\nCastigantes: Medieval Waldensian Asceticism\" in <i>Monks, Hermits and the Ascetic\nTradition: Papers read at the 1984 Summer Meeting and the 1985 Winter Meeting of the\nEcclesiastical History Society</i>, (London: Basil Blackwell, 1985) pp. 218,219. </p>\n\n<p>36See a concise analysis of Asceticism based on the writings of Augustine in Henry\nChadwick, \"The Ascetic Ideal in the History of the Church,\" in Monks Hermits and\nthe Ascetic Tradition, pp. 1-23. This period was formative for the history of asceticism\nin the church, because the overwhelming influx of so-called \"converts\" after\nConstantine was threatening to erase the distinction between Christian and pagan. In the\nface of social pressure to become Christian, millions were joining the church without\nhaving been converted. Thus, in addition to the dualistic reasons for asceticism\n(suspicion of the material world) there was the effort to put distance between one's self\nand the nominal Christians (see pp. 8-9). </p>\n\n<p>37James Doyne Dawson, \"Richard Fitzralph and the Fourteenth-Century Poverty\nControversy\", <i>Journal of Ecclesiastical History</i>, Vol. 34, #3 (Jul. 1983) p.\n317. </p>\n\n<p>38Eschatological, because concerned with making it to heaven (see note 38 below).\nHowever, the other ascetic orders also were concerned with making it to heaven.

Goodrich, \"The Cistercian Founders and the Rule: Some\nReconsiderations,\" in <i>Journal of Ecclesiastical History</i>, Vol. 35, No.3 p. 358\n(July 1984). </p>\n\n<p>40Although Pius Melia claims that, \"It is therefore beyond doubt that, before the\ntime of Luther and Calvin, the Waldenses admitted all the books of the [Catholic] Bible. .\n.\" (e.g. including the Apocrypha) the only evidence he gives is the presence of two\nportions of apocryphal books in translation in the Cambridge collection of Waldensians\nmss. Pius Melia, D. D., <i>The Origin, Persecutions, and Doctrines of the Waldenses</i>,\np. 93,98. However, this conclusion seems unwarranted. <i>The Waldensians</i> definitely\nrejected the existence of purgatory during the early period, and claimed that it was\nforeign to the scriptures. They also argued that there was nothing anyone could do once a\nperson died, as can be seen from the following early record of the Inquisition. </p>\n\n<p>\". . .one who does good will go to paradise, and one who does evil will go to hell\nand damnation; purgatory does not exist. Indeed, whoever believes in purgatory is\ncondemned already. Further, charities after one's death should not be done, for charities\nafter death have no value; that they do not profit the one who does them if they are not\ndone before death. . .\" \"Interrogation of Filippo Regis\" at his trial in\n1451, published by G.

There is no statement in any Waldensian writing affirming the canonicity of the\nApocrypha. These books, like the writings of the fathers (which are also found in\nWaldensian translation) were apparently used as supplemental material, as indeed they were\nso viewed by most of the Roman Catholic Church during this period. </p>\n\n<p>41The established orders of monasteries were obtaining great wealth during this period.\nSee Bainton's insight that when reaching new areas during a time when currency was\nworthless, only a self-supporting monastery was in a position to survive. Later, as land\nwas donated, the serfs were donated along with it. The monks would accept the serfs, and\nso became land major lords. \"Altogether they were the most enterprising businessmen\nof their day.\" Roland Bainton, \"The Ministry in the Middle Ages,\" in <i>The\nMinistry In Historical Perspective</i>, H.

Willians,\nEditors, (New York: Harper &amp; Brothers Publishers, 1956) pp. 86,87. </p>\n\n<p>42Giorgio Tourn, <i>The Waldensians</i>, p. 6,21,39. </p>\n\n<p>43By the end of the 15th century Biller is able to describe the Waldensian\n\"brothers\" as giving, \". . .a two dimensional picture of the asceticism of\na strict and clandestine mendicant Order.\" Yet one has to remember that this was\nalmost 300 years after the movement had begun. One only has to compare the church in 350\nAD to the church in Acts to realize how much things may have changed in such a long\nperiod. Peter Biller, \"Multum Ieiunantes et se Castigantes: Medieval Waldensian\nAsceticism\" in <i>Monks, Hermits and the Ascetic Tradition</i>, p. 223. When taking\nconfession, \"their penance was heavier than that imposed by the priests in the\nChurch.\" For instance, they demanded \"fasting one or two days a week for a year\nor several years\" for excessive love-making with one's wife or husband (p. 226). </p>\n\n<p>44The reason for the rejection of Waldo is given as his ignorance. Yet, Francis was not\nrejected. Of course, there were different popes involved, and the church had the\nexperience of <i>The Waldensians</i> to reflect on at the time of Francis. I think that\nthe only visible difference of importance was the fact that Waldo had the Bible\ntranslated. Therefore, when the Poor of Lyons preached, it was with a Bible in their hands\nin the vernacular. This was probably a level of authority too threatening to tolerate. </p>\n\n<p>45Edward Peters ed., <i>Heresy and Authority in Medieval Europe: Documents in\nTranslation</i>, (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1980) p. 140. </p>\n\n<p>46In the year 1180, Henri de Marcy, the Pontifical Delegate, was in southern France to\norganize a campaign against the Cathari, and there encountered Waldo. He called on Waldo\nto sign a statement of adherence to the Roman Catholic faith, and without hesitation he\ndid so. Giorgio Tourn, <i>The Waldensians</i>, p. 11. </p>\n\n<p>47\". . .the praxis of the primitive church plays a normative role for <i>The\nWaldensians</i>. . . it constantly occurs in their theological declarations, next to the\nreference to the dominant authority of Scripture. . .\" Milic Lochman, \"Not Just\nOne Reformation: The Waldensian and Hussite Heritage.\" <i>Reformed World</i>.

Likewise, Margaret Deansly, <i>A\nHistory of the Medieval Church 590-1500 </i>(London: Methuen &amp; Co. Ltd., 1972) p. 221.\nBut Tourn says that this was only a prohibition of their preaching. He says that they were\nnot definitively condemned for heresy until the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215. Giorgio\nTourn, <i>The Waldensians</i>, p. 232. </p>\n\n<p>51The reason given was \"obstinacy.\" Giorgio Tourn, <i>The Waldensians</i>, p.\n12. </p>\n\n<p>52Giorgio Tourn, <i>The Waldensians</i>, p. 12.

Tourn adds that <i>The Waldensians</i> struck a chord with the tone of northern\nItalian piety. The Pateria were very receptive to <i>The Waldensians</i> in this region.\nThey also met some of the followers of Arnold of Brescia, the disciple of Abelard, who had\ntravelled all over Europe making the acquaintance of various dissident groups and had even\nstarted a popular movement in Rome. It was Arnold who first advanced the notion of a\ncomplete separation between religious and political powers.\" Giorgio Tourn, <i>The\nWaldensians</i>, pp. 15,16. It is in the addition of the North Italian dissidents that <i>The\nWaldensians</i> could claim some pre-existence. There had been resistance to Papal claims\nin this area for some time, but it was not based on evangelical doctrine, as some\nprotestant writers assert. </p>\n\n<p>54This tenant led to added persecution in a day when fealty oaths were the basis of\nsociety. <i>The Waldensians</i> were outside the law, because they refused to swear\nallegiance to anyone. Some Inquisitors claimed that they were allowed to swear a limited\nnumber of oaths under torture in order to save themselves and others. Bernard Gui,\n\"Manuel de l'Inquisiteur\", in Jeffrey Burton Russell, <i>Religious Dissent in\nthe Middle Ages</i>, pp. 51,52. </p>\n\n<p>55Pius Melia, D.D., <i>The Origin, Persecutions, and Doctrines of the Waldenses</i>,\npp. 101-129. This section of Melia's book has been copied for viewing at Xenos Fellowship\noffice. It not only cites several original Waldensian and inquisitorial documents for each\npoint in the original and in translation, but in addition, each doctrine mentioned is\nanswered from the Roman Catholic point of view. Melia cites the scriptural and \"de\nfide\" documents with references that set forth the Roman Catholic position on each\npoint. Such a defense is unusual and hard to find, especially in such condensed form. </p>\n\n<p>56According to Tourn, \". . .in Waldensian thinking one cardinal point had stood\nout from the beginning: an insistence on a clear separation between the civil power and\nthe exercise of religion. . .\" Giorgio Tourn, <i>The Waldensians</i>, p. 70. This\nidea seems to also underlie numerous claims by inquisitors that <i>The Waldensians</i>\nrejected the authority of all earthly princes. It is likely that they were actually\nrejecting the right of secular rulers to lead pogroms supposedly based on religion. </p>\n\n<p>57A typical witness to this view is Raymond de Costa's description of a Waldensian\neucharist, \". . .bless, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, this bread,\nthis fish, [a distinctive Waldensians addition] and this wine, not as a sacrifice and\noffering, but as a simple commemoration of the most holy supper which Jesus Christ our\nLord instituted. . .,\" From the \"Testimony of Raymond de Costa at his trial in\n1320,\" published by J. Duvernoy, <i>Le Registre d'Inquisition de Jacques Fournier,\nToulouse, 1965</i>. partially reproduced in Giorgio Tourn, <i>The Waldensians</i>, p.\n41,42. </p>\n\n<p>58Tourn says, \"The fact, for instance, that any true believer could administer the\nsacrament of the Lord's Supper indicates that the hierarchical structure of the Church\nwith its sacerdotal power had been overcome.\" Yet it is not clear what went in its\nplace. Giorgio Tourn, <i>The Waldensians</i>, p. 50, 51. One of the statements in a\ndocument called, \"Waldo's statement of Faith\", dated by Tourn 1180 is, \"We\nbelieve also that anyone in this age who keeps to a proper life, giving alms and doing\nother good works from his own possessions and observing the precepts from the Lord, can be\nsaved.\" p. 14.

Not everyone agreed with coercion.\nGenoa and Piacenza, for instance, refused to include in their legislation any laws against\nthe heretics; Cremora advertised itself as a kind of free zone for any escapees from the\ncrusade of 1208.

He also warns that not all references\nto Waldensians are to be believed, \"heretical tendencies of every sort were called\n`Waldensian.' One remembers that Joan of Arc was condemned for her `Waldensianism.' In the\nIndex of the Flemish Church, Waldensian meant a mysterious character, close to the world\nof witches and sorcerers, worshipers of the devil and practitioners of black magic.\nFascination with this view has rewarded us with verbal accounts by inquisitors and also\nsome remarkable miniatures by Flemish artists, such as those picturing Waldensians flying\non brooms or participating in the nightly excursions and dances of witches.\" p. 40,\n41 He also produces a plate of one of the broom flying pictures on after p. 46. </p>\n\n<p>69Giorgio Tourn, <i>The Waldensians</i>, p. 66. </p>\n\n<p>70The practice of calling their leaders \"uncles\" stemmed from the desire to\nliterally obey the command in the gospels to \"call no man father. . .[or]\nteacher\" (Mt. 23:8-10), and because the term was deceptive and helped keep secret who\ntheir leaders were. </p>\n\n<p>71Giorgio Tourn, <i>The Waldensians</i>, p. 59,60. </p>\n\n<p>72Giorgio Tourn, <i>The Waldensians</i>, p. 64,65. There were also other incidents of\nviolence, though few in number. \". . . <i>The Waldensians</i> assassinated the\ninquisitors Peter of Verona and Conrad of Marburg; we know also that not a few priests in\nBohemia who were caught up in the repression there came to the same end.\"(p. 48). </p>\n\n<p>73Giorgio Tourn, <i>The Waldensians</i>, p. 64 </p>\n\n<p>74Giorgio Tourn, <i>The Waldensians</i>, p. 69 </p>\n\n<p>75Quoted in Jan Milic Lochman, \"Not Just One Reformation: The Waldensian and\nHussite Heritage.\" <i>Reformed World</i>. Vol. 33, No. 5 (Mar. 75) p. 221. </p>\n\n<p>76Cameron thinks that this Synod was not an orderly meeting as Tourn suggests, but a\nseries of discussions between various clusters of Waldensians and Reformed over a period\nof time, perhaps punctuated by one major meeting. Unfortunately, based on the documents he\nanalyses, it is hard to understand his point. He admits that such a meeting did occur, and\nthat the outcome was as claims, but he refers to it as the \"The myth of\nChanforan.\" Euan Cameron, <i>The Reformation of the Heretics: The Waldenses of the\nAlps, 1480-1580</i>, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984) pp.138-144. </p>\n\n<p>77<i>The Waldensians</i> agreed.

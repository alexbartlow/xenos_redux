We have been\ninvited into a personal relationship with Christ--a relationship that can be experienced.\nWe have been given the gift of the New Covenant--the Holy Spirit who personally\ncommunicates the life of Jesus Christ to us and through us to the world. For these and\nother biblical reasons, we are fully justified in both wanting and cultivating a rich\nexperiential dimension in our relationships with Christ.</p>\n\n<p>But there are dangers on this path which we must be careful to discern and avoid.\nBecause spiritual experience is by its very nature subjective, it is imperative that our\nexpectations in this area be formed by scripture. If we set our expectations unbiblically\nlow, we may experience and demonstrate a Christianity that is lifeless and dishonoring to\nthe Lord. But if our expectations exceed what is taught in scripture, we may needlessly\ndisappoint ourselves and also bring the Lord into disrepute because of our weirdness. Let\nus consider each of these dangers in turn.</p>\n\n<h3>\"Crisis\" and \"Process\"</h3>\n\n<p>\"Crisis\" is used in this paper to describe the unusual manifestations of\nGod's presence and activity, including instant or rapid physical and emotional healing,\nvisions, and being \"slain in the Spirit.\" Such events are \"crises\" in\nthe sense that God does something which is both dramatic and unusual. \"Process\"\nrefers to the more subtle work of God in sanctification and ministry. It is a\n\"process\" precisely because it is accomplished gradually and through our\nconsistent cooperation with God through the normal means of growth. </p>\n\n<p>We can contrast different approaches to spirituality by comparing how much they\nemphasize \"crisis\" and \"process.\" Charismatic and \"third\nwave\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm#Footnote1B\" name=\"Footnote1A\"> Footnote1</a> advocates\nregard \"crisis\" experiences as a normative feature of the Spirit-filled life. In\nother words, every Christian who is really walking with God will have dramatic spiritual\nexperiences on some fairly regular basis. Pentecostal and charismatic theology typically\naffirm this by insisting that the \"baptism of the Holy Spirit\" is manifested by\nspeaking in tongues, or by insisting that physical healing will always occur if we have\nenough faith. While \"third wave\" theology is more mainstream in these areas,<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm#Footnote2B\" name=\"Footnote2A\"> Footnote2</a> they nevertheless insist\nthat signs and wonders are normative for the church age.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm#Footnote3B\" name=\"Footnote3A\"> Footnote3</a> </p>\n\n<p>Non-charismatic advocates, on the other hand, emphasize \"process.\" Some argue\nthat God has withdrawn all sign gifts from the church after the New Testament was\ncompleted. Others acknowledge that God still intervenes via \"crises,\" but less\noften than he did during the time of Jesus and the apostles. Still others hold that God\nintervenes through \"crises\" as much as he ever did, but that charismatics\nexaggerate the frequency of such experiences in the book of Acts.</p>\n\n<p>We should not take the position that God does not work today through \"crisis\"\nexperiences. The Bible, church history, and contemporary Christian experience all affirm\nthat God can and sometimes does intervene in dramatic ways. But when Christians emphasize\n\"crisis\" as much as or more than \"process,\" they tend to make some\nserious mistakes. We should be aware of these mistakes ourselves, and we should help those\nunder our leadership steer clear of them.</p>\n\n<h3>The Hermeneutical Problem</h3>\n\n<p>Both charismatic and \"third wave\" advocates usually draw heavily from the New\nTestament narrative and example as they develop their conclusions about normative\nChristian spirituality. But this is improper, because there may be unique features in such\naccounts that should not be factored into our general conclusions about spirituality.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm#Footnote4B\" name=\"Footnote4A\"> Footnote4</a> Instead, we should look\nprimarily to the didactic portions of the New Testament which refer to all Christians.\nJohn Stott's reminder is timely: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What is described in Scripture as having happened to others is not necessarily intended\n  for us, whereas what is promised to us we should appropriate, and what is commanded us we\n  are to obey&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;What is descriptive is valuable (in determining what\n  God intends for all Christians) only in so far as it is interpreted by what is\n  didactic&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;We must derive our standards of belief and behavior\n  from the teaching of the New Testament&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;rather than from the\n  practices and experiences which it portrays.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm#Footnote5B\" name=\"Footnote5A\"> Footnote5</a> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This material would include those portions of Jesus' teaching which concern the church,\nthe apostles' teaching in Acts, and most of the pastoral epistles. But the main body of\nmaterial would be the epistles written to whole churches or groups of churches.</p>\n\n<p>When we study this body of material, it is clear that they simply do not emphasize\n\"crisis\" experiences as a normative feature in Christian spirituality. Rather,\nwe find that Christian spirituality is defined primarily as learning to view all things\nfrom the perspective of God's revealed truth, cooperating with God in the transformation\nof our moral characters, and practicing sacrificial love toward Christians and\nnon-Christians.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm#Footnote6B\" name=\"Footnote6A\"> Footnote6</a> These\npassages also encourage us to pursue this spirituality primarily through the\n\"process\" of consistent participation in the \"means of\ngrowth\"--scripture, prayer, God's discipline, fellowship, and ministry. Of course, we\nshould do this with an attitude of dependence on God's Spirit to enlighten and motivate\nand empower us, because spirituality is not attainable by human will-power. As J. I.\nPacker says, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;the Spirit works through <i>means</i>--through\n  the&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;means of grace&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;The Spirit shows\n  his power in us, not by constantly interrupting our use of these means with visions,\n  impressions, or prophecies, which serve up to us ready-made insights on a plate, so to\n  speak (such communications come only rarely, and to some believers not at all), but rather\n  by making these regular means effective to change us for the better and for the wiser as\n  we go along&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;Holiness by habit forming (through these means) is\n  not self-sanctification through self-effort, but is simply a matter of understanding the\n  Spirit's method and then keeping in step with him.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm#Footnote7B\" name=\"Footnote7A\"> Footnote7</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Evaluating Other Christians' Spirituality By \"Crisis\" Experiences</h3>\n\n<p>Christian workers must make judgments about the spirituality of other Christians. How\ncan we help someone to mature spiritually if we don't have a picture of what maturity\nlooks like and judge that he doesn't fit this picture? How can we do our job of\nshepherding people if we don't critically evaluate the message of other spiritual teachers\nand leaders who seek to influence them? The truth is that we all have a standard of what\nconstitutes spiritual maturity, and we all constantly evaluate ourselves and others in\nlight of this standard. What is important is not that we make such judgments, but that we\nhave the correct standard (Jn.&#xA0;7:24), and that we judge with a loving and redemptive\nattitude.</p>\n\n<p>If we assume that dramatic spiritual experiences should be normative in the Christian\nlife, we must conclude that those who are not having \"crisis\" experiences are in\nfact sub-standard spiritually. Different charismatic groups express this judgment in\ndifferent ways. Some say such people are \"missing God's best;\" others say they\nare not experiencing the \"Spirit-filled life.\" Third-wave advocates often say\nthis deficiency is the result of a defective world-view which is excessively naturalistic.\nThere are, of course, exceptions to this judgment among those sympathetic to charismatic\ntheology, but they are rare.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm#Footnote8B\" name=\"Footnote8A\"> Footnote8</a></p>\n\n<p>But \"crisis\" experiences should never be regarded as a requirement for or\nevidence of spiritual vitality or maturity. There is simply no scriptural correlation\nbetween \"crisis\" experiences and true spirituality. Scripture is replete with\nexamples of people who experienced God's power in dramatic ways, but who were also\nspiritually carnal. Samson, Saul, and Balaam are Old Testament examples; the Corinthian\nchurch is a New Testament example. As mentioned above, the New Testament consistently\ndescribes spiritual maturity in ways that do not necessitate dramatic spiritual\nexperiences. God can and does work through \"crisis\" experiences, and we should\nthankfully receive all authentic working of God through this means. But we should avoid\nthe inviting but erroneous conclusion that they prove the spirituality of the recipient.\nConsider what J. I. Packer says in this regard. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That, in God's mercy, momentous post-conversion experiences come to some Christians,\n  bringing assurance, liberty of heart, new spiritual joy and energy, with new power for\n  life and witness, is beyond doubt. These, however, seem to be the particular discretionary\n  dealings of a gracious heavenly Father with his individual children. They are not\n  universal requirements, not prescribed patterns of experience for all, not hoops through\n  which every Christian must try to jump. Those who have had no momentous `second\n  experience,' therefore, should not see themselves as necessarily inferior to those who\n  have been thus blessed. History confirms that some of God's finest servants have been\n  enriched this way, while others, equally fine, have not.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm#Footnote9B\" name=\"Footnote9A\"> Footnote9</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Because charismatic and \"third wave\" groups include \"crisis\"\nexperiences in their picture of spiritual maturity, they inevitably have a divisive\neffect. I say \"inevitably\" not because all charismatics and \"third\nwave\" Christians are nasty and mean-spirited. Some no doubt are; many are not at all.\nBut the fact remains that they have included in their picture of spirituality something\nwhich should not be there, and they must (if they are to be consistent) conclude that\nthose who lack such experiences must be seriously lacking in their Christian lives. No\nmatter how nastily or kindly this conclusion is communicated, it is still divisive because\nit puts Christians in the \"unspiritual\" category who do not belong there.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm#Footnote10B\" name=\"Footnote10A\"> Footnote10</a></p>\n\n<h3>Seeking \"Crisis\" Experiences</h3>\n\n<p>If we view \"crisis\" experiences as a means to or evidence of spirituality, we\nwill tend to seek them--just as we will tend to seek biblical knowledge or character\ndevelopment or sacrificial love for the same reason. But there are several dangers in\nseeking dramatic spiritual experiences.</p>\n\n<p>It is not necessarily wrong to ask God to grant us a dramatic experience. Moses\nevidently asked God for this in Ex.&#xA0;33:18, when he cried \"Show me your\nglory!\" And God answered his request--although in a diminished way so that Moses\nwouldn't be killed! But, as Packer said above, God sovereignly decides when to intervene\nin a \"crisis\" manner. He has not promised in his Word to do this at our bidding.\nWe are free to ask God to intervene in this way. It is also important that we truly\nbelieve that he can intervene in this way. We should beware of drifting into a mentality\nwhich expects God to do only that which is humanly explainable. We should also freely\nrejoice and thank God when he does <i>genuinely</i> intervene in this way in our own\nlives, or in others' lives. Something is wrong if we cannot do this. But it is never\nhealthy to insist, or even to expect, that God must work this way in a given situation.\nInstead, we should humbly submit our requests to God and then trust his sovereign wisdom,\nrealizing that he may well decline such requests for his own good reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes God denies such requests because he wants our faith to mature, and such\nmaturity requires that our faith be tested by adversity (1&#xA0;Pet.&#xA0;1:6,7;\nJas.&#xA0;1:2-4; Rom.&#xA0;5:3,4). Especially in a culture like ours which expects a\n\"quick fix\" for all of our problems, it is tempting to expect God to answer our\nrequests for something dramatic. This is why the New Testament letters emphasize the\ndevelopment of perseverance and endurance<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm#Footnote11B\" name=\"Footnote11A\"> Footnote11</a>, while they say little or nothing about seeking\n\"crisis\" experiences from God. Packer is surely right when he says, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The immaturity and childish egoism that infect our culture claim their victims among\n  Christians too. Symptoms of these defects appear in the all-too-common tendency of modern\n  Christians to undervalue the natural and the ordinary. There are just too many people who\n  want every problem to be solved by an immediate miracle, a display of the supernatural, a\n  wonderful providence that will change everything. I think that is a sign not of great\n  faith, but of great immaturity.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm#Footnote12B\" name=\"Footnote12A\">\n  Footnote12</a> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Our part is to patiently and consistently pursue his priorities for our lives, trusting\nthat as we do so God will gradually transform us more and more into Christ's likeness. And\nthis is the most important thing--not whether or not we have been given dramatic\nexperiences along the way.</p>\n\n<p>Seeking \"crisis\" experiences often leads to a reliance on subjective\nimpressions for guidance rather than relying primarily on rational application of\nscripture. While we should realize that God sometimes guides us through intuition and\nother subjective means, we can never be certain that this guidance is from God unless it\nconforms to scripture. Therefore, all claims of such guidance should be tentative, and we\nshould never rely on subjective impressions (no matter how dramatic) as our primary means\nof guidance. Richard Lovelace cautions us against this excess: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The common denominator of all of these aberrations is reliance on subjective experience\n  divorced from the objective control of reason and the written Word of\n  God&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;Christians who block out their minds in the process of\n  attuning themselves to the Spirit are trying to replace an essential human attribute by\n  the gift of the Spirit which is meant to transform that faculty, not replace it. To\n  relinquish the guiding and superintending function of the intellect in our experience\n  seems pious at first, but in the end this course dehumanizes us by turning us into either\n  dependent robots waiting to be programmed by the Spirit's guidance or whimsical\n  enthusiasts blown about by our hunches and emotions. God has provided us with the ability\n  to gather information and to make rational decisions in light of this information in\n  conformity with his revealed will in Scripture. Any method of guidance which habitually\n  detours around reason is crippling and dehumanizing.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm#Footnote13B\" name=\"Footnote13A\"> Footnote13</a> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, Packer cautions: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Charismatic preoccupation with experience observably inhibits the long, hard\n  theological and ethical reflection for which the New Testament letters\n  call&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;Looking for a prophecy (supposedly a direct word from God)\n  when difficult issues arise, rather than embracing the hard grind of prayerful study and\n  analysis, is a tendency that sometimes obtrudes&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm#Footnote14B\" name=\"Footnote14A\"> Footnote14</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Seeking \"crisis\" experiences may also make us more vulnerable to spiritual\ndeception. The very appetite for dramatic spiritual experiences usually militates against\na the watchful and objective discernment that is so crucial for evaluating experiences and\nthose who claim to be able to give them. Yet the Bible insists that we cultivate just such\na mentality if we are to avoid deception--because counterfeits abound. Commenting on\nJohn's command to \"test the spirits\" in 1&#xA0;John&#xA0;4:1-3, Francis\nSchaeffer gives us this warning: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;When a prophet or a spirit comes to you, the test of whether he\n  should be accepted or rejected is not the experience that the spirit or prophet gives you.\n  Nor is it the strength of the emotion which the spirit or prophet gives you. Nor is it any\n  special outward manifestations that the spirit or the prophet may give to you. The basis\n  of accepting the spirit or prophet--<i>and the basis of Christian fellowship</i>--is\n  Christian doctrine. There is no other final test. Satan can counterfeit and he will. I am\n  not speaking against emotion in itself. Of course there should be emotion. I am saying\n  that you cannot trust your emotions or the strength of your emotions or the boost your\n  emotions give you when you stand in the presence of the spirit or the prophet. This does\n  not prove for one moment whether he is from God, or the Devil, or whether the emotions are\n  simply from within yourself.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm#Footnote15B\" name=\"Footnote15A\">\n  Footnote15</a> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We should especially beware when people criticize us for our insistence on objective\ntesting by telling us we are intellectually prideful, or that we may be quenching or\nblaspheming the Holy Spirit.</p>\n\n<p>Seeking \"crisis\" experiences sometimes leads to faking such experiences in\norder to be viewed as spiritual. This is especially likely when the group has made\n\"crisis\" experiences an expectation. I personally know several Christians who\nclaimed to have had overwhelming experiences from God (healings, tongues, visions,\nprophecies, exorcisms, etc.) who later acknowledged they did not. They made this claim\nbecause they were \"going along with the crowd.\" It had become the \"in\"\nthing to have an experience and they didn't want to be left out. This is often not\nintentional in the sense that the person deliberately tried to deceive others.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm#Footnote16B\" name=\"Footnote16A\"> Footnote16</a> It is understandable to\nget caught up in the emotions of the group and to seek the acceptance of one's peers--but\nthis is clearly not a healthy situation.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm#Footnote17B\" name=\"Footnote17A\"> Footnote17</a> Christians who pursue spiritual maturity through\n\"process\" usually avoid this. While they may experience God working in a\ndramatic way and rejoice in it, they know that a stable and consistent walk is a more\nreliable indicator of maturity.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, seeking \"crisis\" experiences can lead to deep disappointment when we\ndon't receive the experiences we were seeking. Many Christians who have a\n\"crisis\" orientation walk away from Christ altogether when God stops working in\nthis way in their lives. This is the tragic result of setting expectations which were\nunrealistically (unbiblically) high. If we focus primarily on following the Lord as a\n\"process,\" we will have a rich experiential life with him (see below). There may\neven be occasional dramatic experiences--but we should see these as a bonus in our walks\nwith God, not as a requisite for them.</p>\n\n<h3>Affirming Healthy Spiritual Experience</h3>\n\n<p>There is a real danger, when confronting any doctrinal imbalance, to overreact and\nbecome imbalanced in the opposite direction. Church history contains ample illustrations\nof this \"pendulum swing\" strategy by which Satan wins a double victory. For\nexample, much of the American Protestant church was lured into theological apostasy in the\nearly part of this century. Their \"social gospel\" rejected many essential\ndoctrines, and orthodox Christians were correct in condemning this. But they also reacted\nagainst virtually all social ministry because of its \"guilt by association\" with\ntheological liberalism. The result has been a disastrous separation of evangelism from\nsocial ministries which has marred the witness of the evangelical church.</p>\n\n<p>The same overreaction is common in the area of spiritual experience. When we see an\nunbiblical emphasis on \"crisis\" experiences, we should criticize this distortion\nand do what we can to correct it. But at the same time, we should be keenly aware of our\nvulnerability to overreact against all spiritual experience. The result will be a\nlifeless, sterile activistic orthodoxy that is every bit as ugly as the distortion we\nreacted against. Francis Schaeffer's warning on this danger should be heeded by all of us:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;in meeting the challenges of the new super-spirituality we must\n  not overreact. I'm desperately afraid of overreaction, &#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;(of)\n  treating Christianity as if it were only a system. God is there, and we must be in a\n  living relationship to Him. Consequently, as we see the new super-spirituality, the danger\n  is that we will overreact and underemphasize the work of the Holy\n  Spirit&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;When a group begins to overemphasize the work of the Holy\n  Spirit at the expense of the full content of Scripture or to underemphasize the status of\n  the intellect&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;, the danger is to talk less and less about the\n  Holy Spirit for fear someone will confuse us with this other group. Instead, a Christian\n  must have the courage to &#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;stress (this area) in (its) proper\n  relationship to the whole of Scripture&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;In the present instance,\n  we must properly stress spirituality&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;a balance not just of\n  abstract doctrine, but a balance to be lived, by God's grace, by the individual and by the\n  group&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;Christianity is not only intellectual, nor is it only your\n  cultural responsibility&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;Christianity is the reality of communion\n  with God in the present life; it is the understanding that there is the indwelling Holy\n  Spirit; it is the understanding that there is the moment-by-moment empowering of the Holy\n  Spirit&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;It is the understanding that the fruit of the Spirit is\n  meant to be something real to <i>all</i> Christians. It is the understanding that prayer\n  is real and not just a devotional exercise. Indeed we must not overreact\n  to&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;super-spirituality, but we must stress that\n  Christ&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;means us to affirm life and not negate life. Such is the\n  ideal. May God show us the living balance and help us to live, by His grace, in that\n  balance.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm#Footnote18B\" name=\"Footnote18A\"> Footnote18</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What can we expect to experience of God's presence if we focus on \"process\"\nrather than \"crisis?\" We can expect the abundant life which Jesus promised, and\nwhich the apostles describe to us in their letters. We can expect the normal work of the\nHoly Spirit in our lives, which is a rich life indeed. As we pursue developing a\ntransformed mind, the Spirit will illuminate our minds (sometimes quite strikingly) with\ninsight about the significance and application of biblical truth to our lives\n(1&#xA0;Cor.&#xA0;2:12; Eph.&#xA0;1:17,18). He will also recall to our memory truths we\nhave studied in situations where we need those truths. These moments of illumination are\nprecious to us. As we pursue a transformed character, the Spirit will touch different\nareas of our lives at different times, convicting us of our sins and urging us to turn to\nGod for help and change (Rom.&#xA0;8:14; Gal.&#xA0;5:18). This care is a wonderful and\ndeeply personal aspect of our relationships with God. As we pursue a life of sacrificial\nlove, the Spirit motivates us to serve others, at times providing us with guidance about\npeople he wants us to serve and ways he wants us to serve them. He also empowers us to\nserve, especially in the areas of our spiritual gifting, so that we experience a sense of\nawe that God is working through us and deeply affecting other lives. We can experience the\nfulfillment of Jesus' promise that it is deeply fulfilling to give our lives away to\nothers for his sake (Acts&#xA0;20:35; Jn.&#xA0;13:17; Jn.&#xA0;12:25). As we step out in\nfaith to share Christ, we can experience the empowering of the Holy Spirit which Jesus\npromised his disciples in Acts 1:8. And we can join in with God and the angels in\nrejoicing when one of our non-Christian friends or family members comes to Christ\n(Lk.&#xA0;15:7,10). As we persevere in private and corporate prayer, we will experience\n(sometimes intensely) personal intimacy with the Lord as the Spirit bears witness to our\nspirit that we are children of God\" (Rom.&#xA0;8:15,16; Gal.&#xA0;4:6;\nJn.&#xA0;14:21,23).</p>\n\n<p>As we continue to trust God and walk by the Spirit, we can experience the joy and peace\nand hope of God in increasing measure and consistency (Gal.&#xA0;5:22; Phil.&#xA0;4:6,7;\nRom.&#xA0;14:17; 15:4,13). However, this does not mean we will \"break the spiritual\nsound barrier\" after which we remain in a state of bliss. This view of spirituality\nis more Buddhist than Christian. There will be \"dark nights of the soul\" when\nGod seems to have hidden his face from us--but if we press on we will emerge with deeper\nconfidence in his faithfulness and goodness. There will be times of deep pain as the\nbattle against Satan presses in upon us--but if we stand firm we will see the Lord win\nvictories over him. There will be periods of deep disappointment and dismay as God reveals\nnew depths of our sinfulness to us--but if we cling to his grace we will also experience\nhis power to transform us. There will suffering--including additional sufferings because\nwe have chosen to follow Christ--but if we endure we will also experience God's comfort\nand strengthening in surprising and deeply personal ways (2&#xA0;Cor.&#xA0;1:6). This\ncombination of negative and positive experiences is part and parcel of the normal\nChristian life. Knowing Christ involves experiencing <i>both</i> the fellowship of his\nsufferings and the power of his resurrection (Phil.&#xA0;3:10,11; 2 Cor.&#xA0;4:8-11;\n6:4-10). We should affirm this expectation in our own lives, and we should model and\ncommunicate it to those Christians within our spheres of influence.</p>\n\n<p>God urges us to view this life as a preparation for the next life, rather than\nexpecting this life to fulfill all our hopes. Our culture has taught us to expect complete\nhappiness in this life, and much Christian \"triumphalism\" reflects the infection\nof this unbiblical expectation.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm#Footnote19B\" name=\"Footnote19A\">\nFootnote19</a> In this life we receive the \"first fruits\" of the Spirit, the\n\"down-payment\" of all that he will give us in the life to come\n(Rom.&#xA0;8:23-25; Eph.&#xA0;1:14). Indeed, some of these works of the Spirit are intense\nand wonderful, but they are given by God to remind us that the best is yet to come, so\nthat we will press on in the battle with hope in our hearts. We should run the race with\nendurance just as Jesus did \"who <i>for the joy set before him</i> endured the cross,\ndespising the shame\" (Heb.&#xA0;12:2). We have the brief opportunity in this life to\nwalk by faith and not by sight (2&#xA0;Cor.&#xA0;5:7). The time is coming when faith will\nnot be needed ever again because we will be in God's presence. We have the opportunity in\nthis life to demonstrate our commitment to Christ by suffering for him (Phil.&#xA0;1:29).\nThe time is coming when God will wipe away every tear and more than make up for anything\nwe have suffered for his sake (2&#xA0;Cor.&#xA0;4:17). Let us seize this opportunity and\nserve the Lord with our whole hearts!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm#Footnote1A\" name=\"Footnote1B\">Footnote1</a></p>\n\n<p>\"Third wave\" theology refers to the theological position held by John Wimber\nin his books <i>Power Evangelism</i> (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1986) and <i>Power\nHealing</i> (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1987), Wimber's \"Vineyard\" church\nmovement, and others like C. Peter Wagner in <i>The Third Wave of the Holy Spirit</i> (Ann\nArbor: Servant Publications, 1988). The basic view is that God has poured out his Holy\nSpirit in three \"waves\" during the twentieth century: during the Pentecostal\nmovement at the beginning of the century, during the Charismatic movement in the middle of\nthe century, and now at the end of the century through movements like Vineyard.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm#Footnote2A\" name=\"Footnote2B\">Footnote2</a></p>\n\n<p>Although there are problems here with Wimber's theology.\n\"&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;when Wimber argues that if forgiveness is preached and\nnot all receive it because of unbelief, we nevertheless go on preaching it, and we do\nlikewise with healing, he is in fact arguing that healing and forgiveness are parallel and\ndependent on the same condition. This point was picked up in an Australian interview:\n`When asked if he (Wimber) would be open about the small probability of healing, he\ndeclined. He wants to encourage people to put their faith in God and call upon him for\nhealing. He wants people to know that God can heal and wants to heal and therefore to ask\nexpectantly. He paralleled this to salvation/forgiveness. He said that we do not say to\npeople that they only have a chance of being saved. We say that God can save and wants to\nsave and so we encourage people to put their faith in God and call for forgiveness. Such a\nconfusion of categories is appalling.' It seems beyond doubt that Wimber is guilty of\ncontradiction.\" Thomas A. Smail and Nigel Wright, <i>The Love of Power or the Power\nof Love</i> (Minnesota: Bethany House Publishers, 1994), p.&#xA0;45.

One need not conclude from this\nthat God never works in this way through the church today, but one would conclude that\nsuch working is probably not as frequent as it was during Jesus' and the apostles'\nministries.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm#Footnote5A\" name=\"Footnote5B\">Footnote5</a></p>\n\n<p>John R.

John purposefully defines\nspirituality in these terms in order to combat a Gnostic emphasis on subjective\nexperience. Paul's letters to Timothy and Titus likewise urge them to emphasize doctrinal\nunderstanding (1&#xA0;Tim.&#xA0;1:3,4; 3:2,9; 4:6,13,15; 6:3,20; 2&#xA0;Tim.&#xA0;1:13,14;\n2:8,15,24; 3:14-4:4; Titus&#xA0;1:9,13,14; 2:1,2,7), moral character\n(1&#xA0;Tim.&#xA0;2:2; 3:2-12; 4:12; 6:11; 2&#xA0;Tim.&#xA0;2:3-6,19-22; 3:16;\nTitus&#xA0;1:6-8; 2:2-10; 3:1,2), and love manifested practically through good deeds\n(1&#xA0;Tim.&#xA0;1:5; 2:10,15; 3:4,12; 4:12; 5:10; 6:11,18; 2&#xA0;Tim.&#xA0;1:7;\n2:22,24,25; 3:10; Titus&#xA0;2:2,4,14; 3:8,14). Jesus' primary concerns for the seven\nchurches in Rev.&#xA0;2,3 reveals the same three foci: pure doctrine (2:2,6,13-15,20,24;\n3:8), moral purity (2:14,20-22), and love (2:4,5,19).

Reacting against&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;versions of\nChristianity which play down the supernatural and so do not expect to see God at work, the\nsuper-supernaturalist constantly expects miracles of all sorts--striking demonstrations of\nGod's presence and power--and is happiest when he sees God acting contrary to the nature\nof things&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;For God to proceed slowly and by natural means is to\nhim a disappointment, almost a betrayal. But his undervaluing of the natural, regular, and\nordinary shows him to be romantically immature&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;Charismatic\nthinking tends to treat glossalalia, in which mind and tongue are deliberately and\nsystematically disassociated, as the paradigm case of spiritual activity and to expect all\nGod's work in and around his children to involve similar discontinuity with the ordinary\nregularities of the created world.\" (pp.&#xA0;193,194)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cpcrisis.htm#Footnote8A\" name=\"Footnote8B\">Footnote8</a></p>\n\n<p>For example, John White argues that such manifestations are common only during periods\nof revival, and that even during revivals not all spiritually-minded Christians will\nexperience dramatic manifestations. \"My aim is not to promote manifestations so much\nas to encourage us all to be open to what God is doing and to what I believe he wants to\ndo in sending revival&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;the experience itself is neither here nor\nthere, except as being an evidence that God is moving in revival.

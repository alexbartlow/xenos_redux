The important point to\nSteven is that He did so, \". . .while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he lived in\nHaran.\" (Acts 7:2). Indeed, He directed him to \"Leave your country and your\npeople. . .\" (7:3), just as He would now direct the righteous of Israel to leave\ntheir country and their people for the sake of world-wide witness. Stephen admits that\nAbraham was directed to \"this land\" (tain gain tautain), but reminds them that\nhe never owned a foot of ground in it (vs.5).16 Thus, Abraham was a foreigner in the\npromised land, just as many of the Hellenists and some Gentiles were. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">One might be tempted at this point to argue that this state was hardly God's way, since\nthe promise was still unfulfilled. But Stephen reminds them that even after the birth of\nIsaac, \"Your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own. . .\" for\n400 years (vs. 6). Only then would they come out of that country to serve God in\n\"this place\" (en toi topoi toutoi).17 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The significance of the mention of circumcision in this context is that the covenant\nwas being practiced while no land was owned by Abraham, thus showing that the enjoyment of\nthis covenant was not dependent on being a native of the Holy Land.18</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">The Patriarchs (vs. 8-19)</h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The career of the patriarchs continues to demonstrate the key motifs that interest\nStephen. First, they did not recognize that God was with Joseph, so they sold him.19 In\nthe same way, the present august assembly (though certainly no greater in stature than the\npatriarchs themselves) may have failed to recognize God's agent again in Christ. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">This part of the argument is clear. However, why include the career of Joseph during\nthe famine? To Stephen, the important thing is not that Joseph was sold into slavery, but\nthat he was sold into slavery \"in Egypt,\" (vs. 9). Did this mean that because\nJoseph was out of the land, he was out of the center of action spiritually? Not at all. In\nfact, the center of action moved with Joseph. \"God was with him,\" affirms\nStephen (vs. 9). </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The subsequent events surrounding the famine demonstrated that God was working through\nJoseph the outcast one, an Egyptian slave living outside of Israel. Indeed, God was\nworking so effectively through Joseph that the entire family eventually moved to Egypt,\nand the focus of salvation history during this period shifted completely out of the\npromised land. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">It is true that though Joseph and Jacob died in Egypt, their bodies were brought back\nto Palestine. Yet, according to Stephen, it was to the city of Shechem that they were\ntaken, in the hated territory of the Samaritans.20 </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Moses (vs. 19-43)</h3>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Blasphemy of Moses was part of the charge brought against Stephen, so his analysis of\nthis period in salvation history is important. The elements of the story included by\nStephen focus on: \n</p><ol class=\"style1\">\n  <li>Moses' relation to other races (vs. 21-23) </li>\n  <li>The failure on the part of the people (including the leadership) to recognize him, or to\n    obey his teaching (vs. 24-28,35,37-39) see esp. vs. 25, he \"thought that his own\n    people would realize that God was using him to rescue them, but they did not. and 37\n    \"But our fathers refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him. . .\"21 </li>\n  <li>Moses' and the people's relation to sacred space The last point, regarding sacred space,\n    accounts for the seemingly strange and unnecessary material in this section. First we find\n    that Moses \"fled to Midian, where he settled as a foreigner,\" (vs. 29). It was\n    in Midian, not in Palestine, that he saw the burning bush. It was on an unknown patch of\n    ground somewhere near Sinai that God said, \"Take off your sandals; the place where\n    you are standing is holy ground,\" (vs. 33). Here was authentic sacred ground if ever\n    there was such a thing! </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Yet, interestingly, no one in Stephen's day knew where this ground was. Would it be a\ngood idea to look for the spot in the hope that it was still sacred? Not at all. The thing\nthat made it sacred was the presence of God working there. Now that He had moved on to\nother work, the location of the spot was unimportant. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">It would have been a serious mistake to stand around at this site when God had already\nmoved on! In the same way, according to Stephen, God was moving in new directions as he\nspoke, but He was being inhibited by institutionalized foot-dragging on the part of his\naudience. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Stephen not only points out that Moses did wonders, but he reminds his audience of the\nvenue for those works-- \"in Egypt, at the Red Sea and for forty years in the\ndesert,\" (vs. 36). </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The passage in 40-43 reporting on the practice of idol worship in the wilderness has\nconfused many. Why should Stephen pick out this area of sin to report on? Surely there\nwere ample examples of unfaithfulness to the law in Deuteronomy, without having to go to\nthe book of Psalms? The answer, I suggest is that this passage is also dealing with the\nissue of sacred space.22 </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Stephen shows that the inclination of the people has always been to worship and love\n\"the work of their own hands,\" (vs. 41). It was the fact that the animistic gods\nwere tangible, visible and man-made that appealed to the ancient Hebrews, and the same\nfeatures, he suggests, commended the temple and the sacred ground idea to his audience. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/chhist.htm\"></a></span><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/chhist.htm\">Go back to the Church History page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/summns.htm\">Go back to The Summons page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/stvn3.htm\">Read on into the next section of \"Strange Details\"</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/stvn_a.htm\">Go back to the Strange Details Table of Contents</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Ask Dennis a\nquestion or share a comment.</a> </p>\n\n<p>Download the whole \"Strange Details\" paper (32K) </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Bo back to the Xenos home page</a>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Strange Details in Stephen's Defense: A New Accounting II","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/stvn2.htm"}

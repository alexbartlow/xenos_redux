The document goes on to state that Waldo himself had been a rich merchant who\nunderwent a religious experience which led him to renounce all of his wealth, and \".\n. .observe a life of poverty and evangelical perfection, as the Apostles.\"12 This\nsort of commitment can hardly be considered unusual during this period of history.\nHowever, Waldo went further: </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>\"He arranged for the Gospels and some other books of the Bible to be translated in\n  common speech . . . which he read very often, though without understanding their import.\n  Infatuated with himself, he usurped the prerogatives of the Apostles by presuming to\n  preach the Gospel in the streets, where he made many disciples, and involving them, both\n  men and women, in a like presumption by sending them out, in turn, to preach. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>These people, ignorant and illiterate, went about through the towns, entering houses\n  and even churches, spreading many errors round about.\"13 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Here the heart of what the Poor were all about as well as the crux of their dispute\nwith the Roman Church is evident. Gui goes on later, </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>The principal heresy, then, of the aforesaid Waldensians was and still remains the\n  contempt for ecclesiastical power. Excommunicated for this reason and delivered to Satan,\n  they were precipitated into innumerable errors. . . The erring followers and sacrilegious\n  masters of this sect hold and teach that they are not subject to the lord pope or Roman\n  pontiff or to any prelates of the Roman Church. . .\"14 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The fact that Waldo and his followers rejected riches and lived an austere life was not\nobjectionable to the hierarchy of the Roman Church. The same thing was being done by tens\nof thousands all over Europe. Neither do there seem to have been substantive doctrinal\ndifferences at first. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">This last point is important, because the most intriguing aspect of <i>the Poor </i>is\nprecisely that there was initially no important doctrinal difference. They saw themselves\nas Roman Catholics who were carrying the doctrines of Christianity further than their\nweaker brethren. They even sent a delegation to the third Lateran Council in 1179 to\nobtain Papal approval of their work. There they were examined by an English friar, Walter\nMapes, who in 1184 was in Rome for the council. He recounts, </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>We saw Waldensian men in the Roman Council held by Pope Alexander the Third. They were\n  simple and unlearned, and were thus called from the name of their founder, Valdo, who was\n  a citizen of Lyons on the Rhone. They presented to the Pope a book written in the old\n  Provencal language,15 in which there were texts and comments of the Psalms, and of many\n  books of the Old and New Testament.16 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Mapes questioned them at the council along the following lines, </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>Do you believe in God the Father? They answered, \"We believe.\" And in God the\n  Son? They answered \"We believe\" And in God the Holy Spirit? They answered,\n  \"We believe.\" And in the mother of Christ? They answered \"We believe\".\n  . . </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">At this point the court broke out in laughter because according to Scholastic Theology,\none could only use the formula \"believe in\" with reference to the Trinity. After\nthis conversation, the delegation \"withdrew, covered with disgrace,\" because\nthey had fallen for a trick question.17 They were ordered to cease preaching, and obey\ntheir bishop. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">It is easy to see from this incident that there was no serious issue of doctrine at\nstake. The Waldensian dispute then, centered on the issue of authority. It was the fact\nthat they translated the scriptures, studied them, and \"presumed\" to preach what\nthey believed, without reference to the clergy that was unacceptable.18 Melia declares, </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>. . .when John a Bellismanibus, Archbishop of Lyons, about the year 1182 . . .forbade\n  them both to preach and . . .expelled them from his diocese; no mention was made of their\n  holding any doctrine at variance with the teaching of the Church: they were simply\n  expelled because, being laymen and illiterate, . . . they presumed, against the\n  prohibition of their superiors, to preach, and exercise an office which was confided to\n  the Apostles and to their successors only.19 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">They were arguing that they could draw insight directly from the pages of their\ntranslated Bibles rather than from the Roman Church.20 As one of our earliest sources,\nAlan of Lille put it in his chapter entitled, \"By what authority and for what reason\nit is shown that no one ought to preach unless he has permission from the Bishop,\" </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"style1\">\n  <p>There are certain heretics. . .called Waldenses, after their heresiarch, who was named\n  Waldus, who--led by his emotions, not sent by God--founded a new sect and presumed to\n  preach without the authority of the Bishop, without divine inspiration, without knowledge,\n  and without literacy. He was an irrational philosopher, a prophet without a vision, an\n  apostle without a mission, a teacher without an instructor, and his foolish disciples have\n  led the simple folk astray in many parts of the world. 21 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/waldo1.htm\">Go back to the Waldensian table of contents</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/chhist.htm\">Go back to the Church History page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/waldo4.htm\">Read on to the next section in \"Waldensians\"</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Go back to the Xenos home page </a>\n</p><dl>\n  <dt><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=waldensian\">Ask\n    Dennis a question or share a comment.</a> </dt>\n</dl>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Waldensian Movement From Waldo to the Reformation II","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/waldo3.htm"}

He is referred to\nvariously as Valdes, Valdesius, Valdensius and Waldo (Valdo), from the city of Lyons. </p>\n\n<p>References to the movement he founded (\"Waldensians\" \"the poor of\nLyons\" \"the Leonese\" \"the Poor of Lombardy\" or simply \"the\nPoor\") appear repeatedly throughout the succeeding centuries of European history.\nThey are always in the shadows, always under bitter persecution, always hard to\nunderstand, but always seemingly at the cutting edge of reformation ferment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Sources of Our Knowledge</h3>\n\n<p>The actions and views of Waldo are shrouded in shadow, because neither he, nor\ncontemporaries in his movement ever chronicled their lives. No existing documents speak of\nthe exact year of his birth, of his youth, or even of the very last years of his life.1\nThis problem is made worse by the fact that the Poor of Lyons themselves desired to\nestablish an argument for their legitimacy based on antiquity. </p>\n\n<p>In a day when there was only one legitimate church, the Poor of Lyons felt that they\nhad to answer the charge that they must be heretics because they were new. Therefore, they\ndeveloped the argument that they were the remnant of a movement that had been resisting\nthe Roman Catholic Church since the time of Constantine's donation of the western empire\nto Pope Sylvester in the fourth Century AD. This claim depended on the spurious\ndocumentation for the donation of Constantine, which both Catholics and Waldensians\nbelieved to be authentic at the time but which is actually without historical support.2 </p>\n\n<p>This development would have been harmless enough, but unfortunately, some early\nProtestant historians, writing in the 1600's were also in the market for a claim to\nantiquity. They saw the Waldensians as the bridge between themselves and the Apostles.3\nThey were inclined to believe the legends of the Poor of Lyons, and unfortunately they had\npossession of the earliest authentic Waldensian manuscripts. </p>\n\n<p>These documents were compiled with commentary in a history written by Perrin, pastor at\nLyons in the year 1618.4 Perrin's history was commissioned by the Synod of Dauphiny (which\nincluded the now reformed Waldensian Churches).5 A few years later, in 1655, John Leger, a\nWaldensian pastor, compiled another collection of source material, which eventually wound\nup in the library of the University of Cambridge.6 Perrin and Leger attributed dates to\nthe documents which were far too early. Some Waldensians documents were dated as early as\n1100 AD, (at least 60 years before the movement began). Other documents from the\nreformation period were dated as coming from before the reformation. This had the effect\nof portraying the Waldensian movement as reformed in doctrine throughout their history,\nwhereas in fact they were not reformed until after the reformation.7 </p>\n\n<p>In 1875, Alexis Muston published The Israel of the Alps, which, although critical of\nsome of the earlier work, such as Perrin's,8 continued to accept the basic thesis that the\nWaldensians originated at the time of Sylvester. Almost every Protestant work done since\nthe time of Muston in turn has depended on his work until recent times. In fact, studies\ncarried out by denominations such as the Presbyterians as recently as 1912 have continued\nto follow this line.9 Catholic sources are no better. Melia is an example of a Roman\nCatholic author as recently as 1870 attempting to deny that religious persecution of the\nWaldensians occurred at all.10 In the same way that John Leger accepted exaggerated\naccounts of the persecution, Melia has accepted non-credible Roman Catholic accounts. </p>\n\n<p>It is perhaps not surprising that study of the Waldensians has become unpopular among\nscholars because it is viewed as the province of biased ideologues. For these reasons,\nthere are few contemporary histories of the Waldensian Movement that have scholarly\ncredibility.11 </p>\n\n<p>Because of these developments, it is difficult for the average student of history to\narrive at a clear picture of the chronology and development of the movement without\ncareful comparison of contradictory material. Further, in this case one must not only\ncompare different authors, but must also ascertain that they do not depend on each other. </p>\n\n<p>All we have from the earliest period is a few fragmentary writings from letters,\ncommentaries and poems which circulated within the group, and a larger body of\ncontemporary material written by Roman Catholic clerics, all from a hostile point of view.\nTherefore, as with so many \"heresies\" of the medieval period, it is necessary\nfor the student to read between the lines of detractors' comments to separate the facts of\nthe situation from the polemical elements in the inquisitorial literature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/waldo1.htm\">Back to the Waldensian table of contents</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/chhist.htm\">Back to the Church History page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/waldo3.htm\">Read on to the next section in \"Waldensians\"</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/equip.htm\">Back to the Equipping Division page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Back to the Xenos home page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=waldensian\">Ask\nDennis a question or share a comment.</a>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Waldensian Movement From Waldo to the Reformation I","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/waldo2.htm"}

At first,\nvisitors claimed that, against all odds, the house church movement was still\nintact after 25 years of persecution.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nAfter several years, however, the reports became more sanguine.&#xA0; Estimates\nappeared claiming that there were 30 million authentic Christians meeting in\nhouse churches.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nLater estimates went higher still to 50 million and beyond.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We can appreciate\nthese figures when we contrast them to the estimated number of Christians\nbefore the revolution of 1949.&#xA0; Most authorities estimate that there were less\nthan one million evangelicals, but certainly, no more than two million before\nthe communist takeover.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These reports are\namazing because during the past 30 years the Chinese church has lived under\nacute persecution, probably as harsh as that of any church in the world.&#xA0;\nEstimates of those killed go into the millions.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nIn addition, virtually the entire evangelical Chinese-Christian intelligentsia\nwas destroyed or silenced.&#xA0; Therefore, by even the most conservative estimates,\nthe Chinese church must be considered one of the most victorious in the world.&#xA0;\nDuring a thirty five year period when the church in the developed countries has\nnot experienced any significant growth at all, and in many places has decreased\nin size, the Chinese church has grown at least twenty, and perhaps fifty-fold.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It seems today\nthat most of the ferment of growth in China is occurring, not in the Government\nsanctioned \"Three-Self Patriotic Movement\" (TSPM) churches, but in\nless organized and illegal house churches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Standing at the\nheadwaters of much of this spiritual ferment is a shadowy figure to western\neyes.&#xA0; He is an enigma, and a paradox, but unquestionably one of the great Christian\nworkers of this century-- Watchman Nee.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"style2\">Biographical Background</h2>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Watchman Nee was\nborn Ni Shu-tsu or Henry Ni in Swatow, November 4, 1903.&#xA0; He was later renamed\nNi Ching-Fu, and finally, after his commitment to Christian work, Ni To- sheng--\nthat is, Watchman Nee. </p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">His father, Ni Weng-hsiu\nor Nga Ung-siu of Foochow, born in 1877, was the fourth of nine boys.&#xA0; He\nserved as officer in the Imperial Customs Service and died in Hong Kong in\n1941.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Like so many well\nknown servants of God, Watchman Nee had a family heritage of Christian\nService.&#xA0; The first school in Foochow offering western-style education was\nopened in a suburb of the old city in 1853, and it was here that Watchman Nee's\ngrandfather Nga U-cheng heard of Jesus Christ and was won to Him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Four years later\nin 1857, the year in which the first Christian church in Foochow came into\nbeing, he was one of a group of four pupils baptized in the Min River.&#xA0; He\nprogressed so well that the missionaries trained him as an evangelist, and soon\nhe was proclaiming the gospel in this city of half a million souls.&#xA0; Eventually\nhe was ordained a pastor, the first Chinese to be so honored in the three north\n Fukien missions.&#xA0; He had a gift for expounding the Scriptures for which, after\nhis death in 1890, he was long to be remembered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The strongest\ninfluence in Nee's early ideological development seems to have been his mother\nLin Huo-ping.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nHer early experience included being sold as a slave to another couple in Foochow\nby her parents who could no longer afford to feed her.&#xA0; These in turn sold her\nto a wealthier merchant as an adopted daughter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Huo-ping is\nportrayed by Kinnear as a strong-willed woman who became belatedly, but deeply\ncommitted to Christ and the Scriptures.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nShe seems to have been mentally gifted, easily excelling the other students in\nthe western style school in which she studied-- the Chinese Western Girls School\nin Shanghai.&#xA0; She had been deeply influenced by Huo King-en, who was at that\ntime only the second women in China to have graduated in medicine in the U.S.&#xA0; Huo-ping\nprevailed on her father to work towards sending her to the U.S.&#xA0; to study\nmedicine as well.&#xA0; Another gifted woman who affected Huo-ping at this time was\nDora Yu, who had also been selected to study abroad, but had felt called of God\nto return from Europe to preach in China instead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Before Huo-ping\ncould carry out her plans, her mother accepted a marriage contract with Nga Ung-siu\n(Nee's father, who was later renamed Ni Wheng-hsiu by the civil service).&#xA0; It\nwas inconceivable at that time for her to violate an agreement entered into\nwith full parental authority.&#xA0; With bitterness of heart, she submitted to the\ninevitable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Her marriage,\nwhich seems to have turned out alright after all, issued in nine children.&#xA0;\nWhile raising them, Huo- ping became active in patriotic activities associated\nwith Sun Yat-sen.&#xA0; She was a tireless political organizer and agitator, forming\nthe Women's Patriotic Society and often speaking publicly.&#xA0; When Sun Yat-sen\ncame to Foochow in 1913, she was given an official role in the reception.&#xA0;\nEventually she was awarded the order of the Second Class for Patriotism by the\nKuomintang government.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When, in 1919, she\ncommitted her life to Christ, she became active in evangelistic preaching, and\nher political activities diminished.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"style2\">Cultural Background: East vs.\nWest in the Church</h2>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Thus in the early\nlife of Huo-ping as well as her husband's family, the interplay and indeed the\nclash of Chinese and Western influences, with Christianity confusingly\nintertwined.&#xA0; In this respect the Nee's are typical of China as a whole at this\ntime.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It is impossible\nto study the history of the church in China without appreciating the intimate\nand eventually dangerous interplay between Western culture and the Christian\nchurch in China.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dr. Ng has pointed\nout that nationalism came late to China.&#xA0; However, there was a strident form of\n\"culturism\" that preceded nationalism as such. As Ng puts it,</p>\n\n<p class=\"Quotations\">\"What lay\nbeyond its (China's) borders was of little value or consequence, and the need\nto compete with outside forces simply did not exist.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Manchu Dynasty\nat this time had a strictly isolationist outlook.&#xA0; Fifty years earlier Emperor Chien\nLung had said to George III of England, \"As your envoy can see for himself,\nwe possess all things.&#xA0; I set no value on objects strange and ingenious, and\nhave no use for your country's wares.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"The Opium\nWars (1839-42) which shocked China out of her complacency, could be taken to\nmark the beginning of nationalism in China.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn11\" name=\"_ftnref11\" title=\"\"></a>\nThis national humiliation woke the Chinese up to the need to rise up to the\nchallenge of the west.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After 1842, the\nBritish and the Dutch were eager to establish trade with China.&#xA0; At that time Hong\n Kong was ceded to the British and five coastal cities were opened to Western\ntrade.&#xA0; But this concession had been wrung from the Chinese at the barrel of a\ngun.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Even after giving\ntrading rights to the British, the Chinese forbade bartering, and would only\nallow the British to buy Chinese wares with silver.&#xA0; This was hardly what the\nBritish had in mind.&#xA0; It was later discovered that the Chinese could be\npersuaded to pay cash for Indian opium.&#xA0; For this reason the British forced the\nManchu Dynasty to legalize the use of opium in the \"unequal treaties\"\nsigned in 1862.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn12\" name=\"_ftnref12\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It was during this\nperiod that Protestant missionaries began to arrive in China in great numbers.&#xA0;\nHudson Taylor arrived in 1854 and founded the China inland mission in 1865.&#xA0;\nTherefore, in many Chinese minds there was an intimate connection between\nChristianity and the western gunboat diplomats who were humiliating the Chinese\nat the same time they fostered the opium trade.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn13\" name=\"_ftnref13\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">From 1851 to 1864\nthe country suffered terribly from the Tai-ping Rebellion led by an\nunsuccessful candidate for civil service examination.&#xA0; Hong Xiuquan had been\ninfluenced by Christian tracts, and because of a dream, felt that he was called\nto rid China of idolatry and corruption.&#xA0; He set out to overthrow the Manchu\nDynasty and replace it with a heavenly kingdom named Tai-ping, meaning\n\"great peace\".&#xA0; As the revolution developed, mystical and\nsuperstitious elements were added, and in time the movement lost any Christian\nemphasis it may have had.&#xA0; Hong became obsessed with the idea that he was the\nyounger brother of Jesus Christ.&#xA0; He established his capital in Men Ging and\nfor 10 years his armies extended their control over large areas of the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When Shanghai was\nthreatened however, the foreign powers organized an army and helped the corrupt\nimperial Manchu forces to destroy the Tai-pings.&#xA0; It is estimated that some 20\nmillion people were killed during the more than 10 years of that war.&#xA0; The\nassociations between the Taipings and Christianity were not helpful to the\ndeveloping impression of Christianity in the minds of most Chinese.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn14\" name=\"_ftnref14\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">By this time the\nManchu Dynasty was too weak to resist Western influence.&#xA0; The unequal Beijing\nTreaty of 1861 allowed missionaries to own land in China's interior and thus\nled to the building up of large institutions.&#xA0; The Roman Catholic church became\na great land owner and later these same large institutions attracted strong\ncriticism from Communist and other nationalist leaders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">More and more\nmissionaries arrived to work in schools, colleges and hospitals, introducing\nwestern science and technology.&#xA0; Bohr says that the Chinese field had absorbed\nmore effort, money, and human resources than any other mission field.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn15\" name=\"_ftnref15\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nAlthough all authorities agree that Christian missionaries opposed and deplored\nthe opium trade which was being fostered by their own governments, it was\nimpossible for most Chinese to distinguish between white skinned, red-haired\nmissionaries and white skinned, red- haired merchants who had come to exploit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 1900 the I Huo\nChuan (or Righteous Harmony Fists), whom the foreigners knew as the 'Boxers',\nwere murdering Chinese Christians and spreading anti-foreign outrage. The\nastute and unprincipled Empress Dowager, seeking to harness the dangerous\nmovement to her own ends, had issued an order to destroy all aliens China-wide.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn16\" name=\"_ftnref16\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Very much of the\nfury, both in the Boxer rebellion and in the revolution of Sun Yat-sen in 1911,\nwhich finally toppled the corrupt Manchu Dynasty was directed against foreign\nincursion and exploitation of Chinese society.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn17\" name=\"_ftnref17\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In China,\ntherefore, unlike Russia, the poor of the country looked not only to their own\ngovernment, but also to foreign exploitation as the cause of their suffering.\nThis outlook squared well with the tribalistic separatistic attitude of Chinese\nculture for the past two millenia. Ng summarizes this point when he says,</p>\n\n<p class=\"Quotations\">Foreign\nencroachments on China were not only what set Chinese nationalism in motion,\nthey were in fact its prime moving force.&#xA0; Close at the heels of the Opium Wars\nwere the wars with England and France in 1858 and 1860.&#xA0; Then there was the\nSino-Japanese War in 1895.&#xA0; In the treaties signed following China's defeat in\neach of these military encounters, important concessions were made to different\nforeign powers. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0; Thus one of the characteristics of Chinese\nnationalism from its very inception was its anti-foreign tendency.&#xA0; This\nanti-foreign sentiment was manifested again and again after each of the\n\"incidents\", in the forms of street demonstrations, boycotts of\nforeign goods, strikes, and at times attacks on foreign nationals.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn18\" name=\"_ftnref18\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This anti-foreign\ntendency is important because of the close association between Christianity and\nforeign colonial powers in the Chinese mind.&#xA0; Ng reports on a distinct\n\"anti-Christian\" movement during the 1920's, also called the New\nThought Movement.&#xA0; This movement was strong among the young intellectuals\nespecially in the north of China.&#xA0; Their attack was not limited to\nChristianity, because Confucianism was also attacked, </p>\n\n<p class=\"Quotations\">.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;for\nits de-moralizing and de-humanizing effect on the people.&#xA0; The Confucial\nemphasis on meekness, obedience, respect for age, and the abhorrence of\ncompetition was blamed for producing a people that was weak, lacking in\nresistance, and in word, unfit for the demands of the modern world.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn19\" name=\"_ftnref19\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">However,\nChristianity was held doubly guilty by the growing mass of nationalistic\nthinkers, not just because its teachings were damaging, but because it was the\n\"vanguard of Western imperialism\", and the \"tool which\nimperialists used in the exploitation of weak nations.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn20\" name=\"_ftnref20\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of the\nresolutions adopted by the Young China Association in its fifth annual\nconference (August, 1924) read,</p>\n\n<p class=\"Quotations\">That we strongly\noppose Christian education which destroys the national spirit of our people and\ncarries on a cultural program in order to undermine Chinese civilization.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">and again,</p>\n\n<p class=\"Quotations\">As the capitalist\nsystem must first be abolished before a new and just social order can be\nestablished, Christianity, being closely allied with it, must also be summarily\ndealt with.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn21\" name=\"_ftnref21\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When the\ncommunists came to power, a great deal of their appeal came from hatred of\nforeign imperialists.&#xA0; Mao himself had developed an anti-foreign sentiment well\nbefore he became a Marxist.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn22\" name=\"_ftnref22\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nAfter he became a Marxist he continued to demonstrate an outlook that was a\nreinterpretation of Marx along nationalistic lines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Although the whole\nsweep of Mao's policies and teachings regarding Chinese society is clearly\nbeyond the scope of this paper, we will have to consider how Mao's nationalism\nhas been (and is being) expressed toward the church.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Probably never\nbefore had the church's stand in relation to nationalism been any more critical\nin affecting her survival.&#xA0; Never has religious jingoism presented itself as\nany more of a threat and a rival to true spirituality.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"style2\">Nee's Ministry</h2>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It will not be\npossible to recount the events of the thirty years of ministry allowed Nee.&#xA0;\nInstead, we will summarize the major trends and characteristics of his ministry\nand doctrine before considering the legacy of his ministry in China today.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn23\" name=\"_ftnref23\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nee was said to\nbe, \".&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;a very active and mischievous youngster who\nalways ruined furniture and dropped vases.&#xA0; When playing among either brothers\nand sisters of neighboring children, Nee always took a leading part and\ninitiated all kinds of new tricks.&#xA0; From his very early days Nee displayed his\ngift of leadership.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn24\" name=\"_ftnref24\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nee's conversion\ncame at the age of 16 in 1919.&#xA0; His Mother, Huo-ping, had reaffirmed her\ncommitment to the Lord at a series of evangelistic meetings led by Dora Yu, the\nfemale evangelist who had impressed Huo-ping during her college days.&#xA0; When Huo-ping\nwent to Watchman and confessed to unjustly beating him, Watchman decided to\nattend the meetings as well, and was powerfully converted.&#xA0; He offered his\nentire life to God for His service that day, and never changed his mind\nthereafter.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn25\" name=\"_ftnref25\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">During the early\n1920's, Nee was involved in itinerant evangelistic preaching, based out of Foochow.&#xA0;\nHe would usually go out with a small ministry team to preach in a village that\nhad not previously heard the gospel.&#xA0; Kinnear says that Nee was usually\nsuccessful in reaching good numbers of people on these trips.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn26\" name=\"_ftnref26\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nSome trips were undertaken with his mother (who also preached), including trips\noutside of China, to Indonesia.&#xA0; Nee's method of church planting was to begin\nwith a small group of people meeting in a house.&#xA0; Later, a building would be\nsought if the group became large.&#xA0; From then on, they would hold both home\nmeetings and meetings in the building.&#xA0; They would invariably train indigenous\nleadership for these groups.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn27\" name=\"_ftnref27\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nNee also received a bachelor's degree during this period from Trinity college in\n Foochow.&#xA0; During the later 1920's he lost at least two years of work because\nof his tuberculosis.&#xA0; It was during this period that he married Chaing Pin-Hwai,\na family friend who had graduated in literature from the famous Yin King University.&#xA0;\nHer knowledge of literature would assist Nee in his writing and translation\nwork. He remained with her until he was imprisoned.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn28\" name=\"_ftnref28\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">During the 1930's,\nNee traveled widely in China focusing more on church planting than he had\npreviously.&#xA0; The base for his operations moved to Shanghai in 1932.&#xA0; During\nthis period, he also made a trip to England, attending the Keswick convention,\nand eventually having a falling-out with his hosts, the Exclusive Brethren of\nthe \"London Group\", because he refused to separate himself from other\nChristians.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn29\" name=\"_ftnref29\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When The Japanese\nattacked China in 1936, freedom of movement gradually became more difficult.&#xA0;\nThe economy also suffered.&#xA0; Nee seems to have been able to travel into Japanese\noccupied territory with some frequency, although he spent most of his time in\nnationalist areas.&#xA0; It was during this period (in 1942) that he went into\nbusiness with his brother who was a research chemist.&#xA0; He became chairman of\nthe board of China Biological and Chemical Laboratories, a pharmaceutical\ncompany.&#xA0; His declared reason for doing so was the fact that many of the\nleaders of the Little Flock were short of money, and this was a way that he\ncould make tents and support \"those with him\" like Paul did.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn30\" name=\"_ftnref30\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">His fellow workers\nwere against this move on his part, and eventually demanded that he cease\npreaching in the church in Shanghai.&#xA0; Therefore Nee was under church\ndiscipline, and not involved in preaching for several years in the mid 1940's.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 1947, Nee was\nrestored to leadership in the Little Flock church in Shanghai, and again was\nactive in church-planting and training of Christian workers.&#xA0; During the last\nfew years of ministry before the revolution, the Little Flock became involved\nin migration evangelism, based on the scattering of the church in Jerusalem in\nActs 8.&#xA0; This tactic, involved moving an entire house church into an area that\nwas unreached.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn31\" name=\"_ftnref31\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nThe results of this work were apparently striking.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn32\" name=\"_ftnref32\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Although some of Nee's\ntime was spent preaching to a large (5000-7000 attendance) church in Shanghai,\nthe main result of his work was the founding of hundreds of house churches\nthroughout China.&#xA0; These were lay-led groups that centered on Bible study,\nwitnessing to the neighbors, and fellowship.&#xA0; Singing, prayer and communion\nwere also practiced.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In January of 1956,\nNee was brought up on charges by the local authorities in Shanghai, and they\nheld a public \"accusation meeting\". In front of over 2500 people he\nwas accused of espionage, licentiousness and stealing of church funds.&#xA0; His\ndoctrine was also denounced because his preaching on the \"last days\"\ntended to demoralize the workers.&#xA0; He was sentenced to 20 years in prison.&#xA0;\nDays after his release in 1972, Watchman Nee died in his home province.&#xA0; He was\n69 years old.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn33\" name=\"_ftnref33\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It is interesting\nto compare Nee to John Wesley. &#xA0;Wesley's work won, and incorporated into his\nfellowships about 120,000 people over the course of his 52 year ministry.&#xA0;\nBecause of his work, and its aftermath, he is known to most people in the\nwestern world.&#xA0; The books on Wesley in an average library usually take up whole\nshelves, analyzing every aspect of his life and teaching.&#xA0; Watchman Nee,\nprobably exceeded Wesley in terms of the actual size of his ministry, even\nthough the duration of his ministry was only a little over one-half as long,\nand was carried out under circumstances including an 11 year long world war.&#xA0;\nAs will be seen later, the Little Flock movement probably reached a size of\n150,000-300,000 active participants by the time of the revolution.&#xA0; He also\nappears to have spawned a striking aftermath.&#xA0; Yet he is virtually unknown to\nwesterners, and most libraries have nothing on his biography at all!<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn34\" name=\"_ftnref34\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"style2\">Nee's Person</h2>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nee quickly\nmanifested the main personal and spiritual characteristics that would determine\nthe tone of his ministry regardless of subsequent shifts in doctrinal\nemphasis.&#xA0; These characteristics can be summarized as follows:</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>Zealousness</i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nee was unusually\nzealous from the first day of his Christian life until the last.&#xA0; His zeal was\nso intense that it might well have been considered fanaticism in our culture.&#xA0;\nOn the positive side, his zeal no doubt was an important element in his ability\nto lead and persuade others.&#xA0; On the negative side, he tended to lack patience,\ndriving himself to the point of physical collapse on several occasions.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn35\" name=\"_ftnref35\" title=\"\"></a>\nHe lived in self-imposed poverty.&#xA0; </p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>Idealism</i> </p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nee was not only\nidealistic, he was hyper- idealistic.&#xA0; The word \"compromise\" was not\nin his vocabulary.&#xA0; Cliff points out that he bitterly denounced the western\nmissionary churches because,</p>\n\n<p class=\"Quotations\">\".&#xA0;.&#xA0;.\n(he) found the Christians of the missionary societies' churches half-hearted\nand compromising, and charged that the denominations were weighted down with\nwhat was to him manmade traditions regarding baptism, worship and ordination,\nteaching what was quite foreign to what he read in the New Testament.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">and again,</p>\n\n<p class=\"Quotations\">\"Convinced\nof the rightness of his unstructured assembly, free from denominational\ntraditions, he asserted, `Those who really want to live entirely in accordance\nwith the Lord's truth will know real freedom in our midst.'\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn36\" name=\"_ftnref36\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nee considered the\nwestern form of church life (especially the existence of denominations)\n\"an affront to God\".<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn37\" name=\"_ftnref37\" title=\"\"></a>\nHe berated western missionaries for shamelessly asking for money for\nthemselves.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn38\" name=\"_ftnref38\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nHe deplored the clergy/laity distinction that was so strong in western\nChristianity.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn39\" name=\"_ftnref39\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\n\"While the responsibility of expanding the work of the Church lay chiefly,\nif not solely on the shoulder of the pastor in the other denominational\nchurches, Nee concentrated on training all the believers to do the work of\nGod.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn40\" name=\"_ftnref40\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Thus Nee manifests\nhimself as a purist in terms of primitive biblical Christianity.&#xA0;\nInterestingly, Cliff points out that a number of western missionaries agreed\nwith Nee's criticisms, and forsook the agencies that had sent them in order to work\nwith Nee.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn41\" name=\"_ftnref41\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nThis did not earn Nee any popularity with western churches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Another aspect of\nthe same purism was his refusal to become a part of the popular nationalism\nthat was dominating China at the time.&#xA0; During the war with Japan, he refused\nto pray that China or Japan would win.&#xA0; \"It must be possible,\" he\nsaid in 1940, \"for British and German, Chinese and Japanese Christians to\nkneel and pray together.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. in China, Christians and Missionaries\nhave too much intimacy with the state.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. we ask for neither a\nChinese nor a Japanese victory, but for whatever is of advantage.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.\nto Thee.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. \"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn42\" name=\"_ftnref42\" title=\"\"></a>\n&#xA0;This remarkable excerpt from a war-time sermon was not what the average\nChinese wanted to hear!</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In another area,\nNee argued that Christian workers should not only refrain from asking others\nfor money for their own ministry, but that they should also not give any\nindication of need whether verbally or otherwise.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn43\" name=\"_ftnref43\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Unfortunately,\nlike so many purists, Nee's meticulous insistence on even the smallest detail\nsometimes resulted in a violation of a major ethical imperative.&#xA0; Nee's\nidealism was one of his greatest strengths, but without prioritization, it also\nbecame a weakness.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn44\" name=\"_ftnref44\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>Studious:</i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nee is repeatedly\ncharacterized by those who knew him as a profound student of the Scriptures.&#xA0;\nHe demonstrates knowledge of the Greek text in his writings, although it is not\nclear to me whether he was versed in Greek or depended on other authorities.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn45\" name=\"_ftnref45\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kinnear comments\non Nee's preaching, that no one ever saw him use any notes, for he remembered\nand could reproduce anything he read.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn46\" name=\"_ftnref46\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nAfter visiting Shanghai Charles Barlow commented:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Quotations\">Some of these\ndear brethren are very sincere and thirsting for truth.&#xA0; Watchman Nee is\nundoubtedly the outstanding man among them.&#xA0; He is far beyond all the rest.&#xA0; He\nis only 28, but has had a good education and is possessed of marked ability.&#xA0;\nHe is a hard worker and reads much.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn47\" name=\"_ftnref47\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Witness Lee said\nof Nee, \"I have never met a man so well-versed in the Scriptures as\nhe.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn48\" name=\"_ftnref48\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nNoted Chinese evangelist John Sung said, \"For exposition of the\nScriptures, I am not equal to Watchman Nee.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn49\" name=\"_ftnref49\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nTherefore, like so many great figures in the history of the church, Nee had\npowerful intellectual gifts that were well developed, as well as a love of\nGod's Word.&#xA0; </p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When this evidence\nis considered, it may seem surprising that Nee is sometimes considered\nanti-intellectual by western readers.&#xA0; This conclusion stems from his mystical-fideistic\nbent which was suspicious of autonomous reason.&#xA0; His very early magazine\ncarried the statement of purpose, \"The fostering and cultivation of the\nspiritual life, with no attempt to debate rationally.\"&#xA0; This position\nseems to have softened in later life, with better education.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn50\" name=\"_ftnref50\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>Activistism</i>:</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Although Nee's\nworks have been rightly criticized for \"superspirituality\", (falsely\ndichotomizing Christian good works and spirituality) his own life does not seem\nto have been plagued by introspective paralysis.&#xA0; Some later readers of books\nattributed to Nee have complained that he calls for so much concern over\nwhether an action is \"soulish\" or \"spiritual\" apart from\nwhether it is ethical, that he becomes very de-motivating, and deflating.&#xA0; A\ncareful reader of Nee has no difficulty identifying faulty statements in this\narea.&#xA0; However, it is interesting to note that Nee's life and that of his\nimmediate hearers was characterized by almost constant action.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn51\" name=\"_ftnref51\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"style2\">Nee's Doctrine</h2>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nee was clearly\ninfluenced by the Plymouth Brethren and the Keswick, or \"victorious\nlife,\" form of teaching.&#xA0; He also read and admired Hudson Taylor, George Meuller,\nand Madam Guyon.&#xA0; These influences are evident from the time of \"The\nSpiritual Man\" (1923) up until \"The Normal Christian Life.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn52\" name=\"_ftnref52\" title=\"\"></a>\nThe appeal of his preaching, according to Kinnear's sources, was \"his gift\nof making so plain the way to God that relies solely upon Christ's finished\nwork.&#xA0; All too many Christians were striving after a salvation based on good\nworks.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn53\" name=\"_ftnref53\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Late in his\ncareer, Nee is said to have developed some doctrinal aberrations that went\nbeyond his usual purism.&#xA0; These areas had to do with a heavy emphasis on\nauthority and submission, and an increasing tendency to dichotomize the\nmaterial and the spiritual, or the ideal and the real.&#xA0; Some of the literature\nthat has come out during the past ten years claiming to originate from the last\n5 years of Nee's ministry are definitely deserving of criticism at many points.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn54\" name=\"_ftnref54\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nHowever, care must be exercised here because of an unusual feature in his\nwritings.&#xA0; Only two books actually written by Nee's own hand are available in\nEnglish.&#xA0; These are <i>Concerning Our Missions</i>, and <i>The Spiritual Man</i>.&#xA0;\nIronically, Nee criticized both of these works.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn55\" name=\"_ftnref55\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nHis other works are translated from notes taken from his lectures, and are\ntherefore open to interpretive additions by the translators.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn56\" name=\"_ftnref56\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Initially, Angus Kinnear\ntranslated notes to produce several titles, including his best known works, <i>The\nNormal Christian Life</i>, <i>Love Not The World</i>, <i>Changed into His\nLikeness</i>, and <i>What Shall This Man Do?</i>&#xA0; Later, the Little Flock\nchurch under the leadership of Steven Kaung published a series of books that\nall have the distinctive plain colored covers of the \"Christian Fellowship\nPublishers\" in New York.&#xA0; These include <i>Spiritual Authority</i>, <i>Spiritual\nKnowledge</i>, and <i>Gospel Dialogue</i>, to name a few.&#xA0; It seems clear to\nthis author and others<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn57\" name=\"_ftnref57\" title=\"\"></a>\nthat there is a more radical interpretation of Nee evident in the later books.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At the same time,\nit can not be denied that Nee was extreme in some areas, including spiritual\nauthority and ecclesiology.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The emphasis on\ndelegated human authority was in perfect harmony with Confucian ethics.&#xA0;\nConfucius taught that parents were never wrong, and that even when they were,\none should obey them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">To understand Nee's\nextreme doctrine of \"locality\", one must remember that he had had a\nrun-in with the exclusive brethren in England, and may have formed a rather\none-sided picture of denominationalism in the west.&#xA0; He certainly did not want\nto see the western denominational divisions transplanted into China, let alone\nthe unloving divisiveness of the exclusive brethren, and he can hardly be\nfaulted for that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nevertheless, the\nfact remains that Nee propounded an unworkable and unbiblical doctrine of\nlocality and of under-qualified obedience to delegated authority which has\nresulted in extremism in modern America, China, and elsewhere.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn58\" name=\"_ftnref58\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"style2\">Nee's Legacy</h2>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It is hard to tell\nhow large the Little Flock movement was in China at the time of the\nrevolution.&#xA0; One reason for this is the fact that Nee felt it was fleshly to\nconsider numbers.&#xA0; Therefore there was no systematic effort made by Little\nFlock themselves to count their people.&#xA0; There was no formal membership in the\ngroup, since Nee believed membership in the body of Christ was determined by\nGod, and there was no good reason for the church to try to draw up a list.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to\nCliff, in 1949 the Little Flock had over 70,000 members in 500 assemblies.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn59\" name=\"_ftnref59\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nHowever, according to the Ecumenical Press Service the \"Little Flock\"\nhad at this time 362 places of worship and 39,000 members in the one province\n of Chekiang.&#xA0; These figures were interpreted as indicating that members of the\n\"Little Flock\" made up 15-20 per cent of the whole Protestant church\nin China, and that they may have been the largest single denomination.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn60\" name=\"_ftnref60\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nIn other words, this estimate would show anywhere from 150,000 to 300,000\nmembers for the Little Flock.&#xA0; Cheung affirms that there were\n\"thousands\" of assemblies by 1956, and that the Little Flock was the\nlargest Christian group in China.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn61\" name=\"_ftnref61\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nobody has even\nhazarded a guess as to how many of the millions of Christians meeting in house\nchurches today may be the outgrowth of Little Flock groups.&#xA0; Two things are\nclear: There are many house churches that are directly derived from Little\nFlock churches, and there are many other groups that owe a substantial debt to\nLittle Flock doctrine and practice for their survival.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The following\ncharacteristics detailed by Adeney demonstrate that God has certainly used the\nunique features of Little Flock to prepare Chinese Christians to live under the\nterrible social conditions of modern China.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Quotations\">When the\norganized churches were destroyed in the Cultural Revolution, traditional forms\nof Christian ministry were also done away with.&#xA0; The household churches have\ncast off the trappings of the West and have developed their own forms of\nministry.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. The dynamics of house churches, therefore, flow partly\nfrom their freedom from institutional and traditional bondage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">and further,</p>\n\n<p class=\"Quotations\">Much that we\nassociate with the Church is not found in Chinese house churches today.&#xA0; They\nhave had to exist without buildings, set times of worship or a paid ministry.&#xA0;\nDuring the Cultural Revolution and even up to the present, the place of meeting\nis often changed form one home to another.&#xA0; Even the time is changed to suit\nthe schedules of the Christians as they work at different hours.&#xA0; Thus, the\nhouse churches are extremely flexible.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn62\" name=\"_ftnref62\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Cliff agrees that,</p>\n\n<p class=\"Quotations\">Many of the\nfeatures of the 'post Denominational Church' in China Nee would warmly endorse,\ndenominational labels have gone.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. as he advocated for many years.&#xA0;\nMost of the pastors are self-supporting and the laity plays a prominent role in\nchurch life-- features with which he would be in full agreement.&#xA0; The Church\nhas been freed from the encumbrances of maintaining large premises and of\nrunning institutional work.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn63\" name=\"_ftnref63\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It is obvious to\nthis author that God was at work during the last years of freedom in China to\nestablish an underground network of house churches that were ideally suited to\nsurvive and grow even in the appalling circumstances of the last 35 years.&#xA0; The\ngroups have a distinct Chinese flavor in their doctrinal outlook and are\nentirely used to carrying on Christian witness on an underground basis.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn64\" name=\"_ftnref64\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Finally, Cliff and\nAdeney report that in the past few years, some groups have split off from the\nregular Little Flock churches to follow the teachings of Witness Lee.&#xA0; These\nhave been dubbed (no doubt by their enemies) the \"screamers.\"&#xA0; The\nname derives from ecstatic prayers offered in unison in the meetings.&#xA0; The\nscreamers have been the target of special persecution in the past five years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to\nCliff,</p>\n\n<p class=\"Quotations\">Many China\nwatchers feel that the Chinese government is making the fanatical behavior of\n'the Screamers' an excuse for tightly controlling all unaffiliated groups.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn65\" name=\"_ftnref65\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"style2\">Nee's View of Church and State</h2>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Watchman Nee and\nMao Tse-tung were contemporaries.&#xA0; Mao, who was ten years older than Nee,\nestablished the Chinese communist party in 1920-- the same year that Nee began\nhis ministry.&#xA0; Kinnear suggests that Nee and Chou En-lai may have been in Shanghai\nat the same time, and that student unrest there, in which Chou participated,\nmay have had appeal to Nee as well.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn66\" name=\"_ftnref66\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nThese two revolutions, beginning at the same time, eventually collided\nhead-on.&#xA0; It certainly seemed clear that, in the race to win China, Mao and\nChou won.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Those involved in\nthe underground church movement in China, as well as the established missions,\nhave engaged in painful soul-searching, wondering whether more could have been\ndone.&#xA0; The Christians had a 400 year head-start on the Marxists, and at least\n70 years of all-out missionizing before a communist party existed.&#xA0; Yet they\nwere apparently swept away by a movement only 30 years old.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn67\" name=\"_ftnref67\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nLately however, some are wondering whether the Chinese Christians might not get\nthe last word!</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One issue that has\nbecome very important in this regard is the area of Christianity and patriotic\nnationalism.&#xA0; As mentioned earlier, nationalism in China was intimately\nconnected with anti-foreign resentment from the beginning.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn68\" name=\"_ftnref68\" title=\"\"></a>\nToday, the communist regime, working through the agency of the TSPM, uses the\nexisting nationalistic consensus in its attempt to extend its control over the\nreligious life of the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In most policy\nstatements, the TSPM refers to patriotism and/or family in the same context as\nreligion.&#xA0; In other words, the twin values of \"blood and soil\" are\nmixed in liberally with Christian vocabulary in an attempt to cater to the\n\"hearth and home\" feelings of the people albeit with a thin coating\nof religion spread over the top.&#xA0; The following statements are illustrative:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Quotations\">\"Freedom of\nreligious belief must operate within the scope permitted by law.&#xA0; Whether\ncitizens are religious believers or not, their common political base is\npatriotism, upholding the leadership of the Party, and upholding socialism.&#xA0;\nThis demands that we Christians uphold the constitution and the government's\npolicies and decrees.&#xA0; This is also a necessary condition for the normalization\nof religious activities.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn69\" name=\"_ftnref69\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"Quotations\">The doors of the\ntwo city Christian organizations are wide open, welcoming everyone--even those\nwho have made mistakes--to change their attitudes and return to the big family\nwhich loves country and loves religion.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn70\" name=\"_ftnref70\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"Quotations\">Fellow workers\nand fellow believers,.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. there are still, according to our\nknowledge, some rather abnormal religious activities in existence in Canton.&#xA0;\nWe hope that the people involved will.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.uphold the policy of the\nThree-Self and be patriotic and law-abiding, going along the road of loving\ncountry and loving religion, and striving together for the unity of the\nchurch.\" </p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">and,</p>\n\n<p class=\"Quotations\">We hope that Lin Xiangao\nwill.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. be at one with the believers in the entire city, standing\non the platform of loving country and loving religion.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn71\" name=\"_ftnref71\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The reader who has\nlearned to read between the lines will quickly recognize the presence of code\nwords in these statements intended to stimulate a warm spot in the heart of the\nChinese people, while keeping all loyalty to Christ strictly contingent upon\nloyalty to the state.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn72\" name=\"_ftnref72\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Should Nee have\ntaken a stronger stand in favor of the state's programs? Kinnear says that,</p>\n\n<p class=\"Quotations\">It seems clear\nthat Nee believed some degree of cooperation with the New Government on the\nlines of Romans Chapter 12 to be both possible and necessary.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. (they\nurged) believers not to emigrate but to stay in China for the Lord's sake.&#xA0;\nThey should be prepared to give up material comforts and, as good Christians\nand good Chinese, to cooperate sincerely with the State when called upon for\nsuch public work as road-building and irrigation works.&#xA0; Only, they must not\nact in conflict with the Bible nor deny their Lord.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn73\" name=\"_ftnref73\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Of course, this\nwould have to be his stand in public, but one wonders how naive Nee was in his\nprivate outlook.&#xA0; Did he realize that it was only a matter of time until the\nwhole church would be forced completely underground? Was he secretly taking\nmeasures to get ready for the ferocious holocaust that was descending?</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kinnear thinks\nnot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Quotations\">It would be\nprobable that Watchman, like so many others, was deceived by those Party\nofficials he observed into thinking them reasonable men who could be dealt with\nwisely.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn74\" name=\"_ftnref74\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If Kinnear is\nright, then Nee was in the same boat as the World Council of Churches, who have\naccepted the legitimacy of the TSPM from the beginning (and still do), as have\nmost of the Protestant mission based churches.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn75\" name=\"_ftnref75\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nIndeed, few could have predicted the horrors of the cultural revolution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nee did seem to be\ninsensitive to the social currents at work in the communist movement in China.&#xA0;\nIn another passage, Kinnear points out that in 1948, the Little Flock churches\nbegan to attain an unexampled level of prosperity,</p>\n\n<p class=\"Quotations\">\".&#xA0;.&#xA0;.\njust at a time when \"capitalist\" was to become a term of opprobrium\nand when, in a regime without any concept of Charities Commission, the mere\npossession of wealth was going to arouse immediate suspicion.&#xA0; The case for\nideological reformation of the movement seems almost, by this ill-conceived\ndevelopment, to have been presented to the Communist Party ready-made on a\ntray.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn76\" name=\"_ftnref76\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Before we become\ntoo critical however, we should probably ask ourselves what we think the Little\nFlock should have done with this money.&#xA0; Further, while this development was\nunfortunate, it is doubtful that it changed the outcome significantly.&#xA0; To committed\nMarxists, a voice like Nee's had to be silenced.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It is the view of\nthis author that Nee and the Little Flock were in a no-win situation, as\nregards their relationship to the political powers.&#xA0; Attempts by Christians to\ncurry favor with the government in China have had pathetic results in the\npast.&#xA0; The Marxist government has cynically used any cooperation offered, and\nlater repressed the appeasing church in the same way they have the resisting\none.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn77\" name=\"_ftnref77\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nThere is also the further issue of whether cooperation with the present regime\ncould be justified even if it did issue in good results on the pragmatic level.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn78\" name=\"_ftnref78\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the view of\nthis author, the best tactic that the Little Flock could have taken is the one\nthey did take--namely, creating the structures needed to take the church\nunderground.&#xA0; Any church that was easy to take over on the organizational level\nproved to be no match for the TSPM and the Religious Affairs Bureau, because of\nthe latter's willingness to use violence.&#xA0; On the other hand, history is clear\nin detailing the difficulty of erasing a true grass- roots movement from any\nsociety.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This means, for\ninstance, that the Little Flock would have had to do their charitable and\neducational works on the level of the local church, rather than through a\nnational denominational agency.&#xA0; Ironically, the doctrine of\n\"locality\" (a hyper-autonomous view of the local congregation), one\nof Nee's most widely criticized doctrines, had the effect of conditioning these\nhouse churches to expect nothing from a national structure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This doctrine\nwould have conditioned them to raise up their own leadership from within the\ngroup as well.&#xA0; Nee taught that, just as foreign missionaries sought to make\nthe Chinese church self propagating, self supporting, and self governing, he\nsought to make the church in each city and village that way.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn79\" name=\"_ftnref79\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0;\nUnder present conditions such an arrangement is essential.&#xA0; Note that there is\nno suggestion that we should adopt a doctrine that is imbalanced, but that God\nhas used the unique features of this group to move ahead even against\nterrifying opposition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One group that\nunderstands the irrepressible nature of grass roots Christianity perfectly is\nthe TSPM and the Religious Affairs Bureau of the People's Republic of China.&#xA0;\nNotice the importance they place on following a normal institutional pattern.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Quotations\">All churches\nwhich have obtained government approval.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. must uphold the\n\"Three Self\" principles, and .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. (a) fix the field of\noperation (local area for the preacher's ministry); (b) fix the place (for the\nchurch); (c) decide on the people (appoint the responsible people).</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">and again,</p>\n\n<p class=\"Quotations\">The ministerial\nactivities and religious activities of each church should all be conducted\ninside the church building.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn80\" name=\"_ftnref80\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Unfortunately, the\nTSPM's zeal for conventional wineskins has nothing at all to do with doctrine,\nbut rather with the issue of control.&#xA0; So far however, they have shown\nthemselves unable to control the Spirit of the Living God.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Today in China according \n    to Bohr, \".&#xA0;.&#xA0;. increasingly critical of Marxist ideology, \n    many Chinese youth claim to be searching for \"spiritual fulfillment.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/nee.htm#_ftn81\" name=\"_ftnref81\" title=\"\"></a>&#xA0; \n    If this is true, there is certainly a growing voice from house churches offering \n    that fulfillment.&#xA0; This is a clear indication that the story of God's witness \n    in China is far from over.&#xA0; Indeed, there is no reason to think that China \n    will not continue to be one of the true spiritual hot-spots in the world--due \n    in part to the work done by one of God's agents, Watchman Nee.</p>\n  <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=watchman\">Ask \n    Dennis a question or share a comment.</a><span><br clear=\"all\">\n    </span> </p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"Section3\">\n\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\n\n<h3>Adeney, David H. <i>China: The\nChurch's Long March</i>.

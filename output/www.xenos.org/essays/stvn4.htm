He\nexplains, \"Obviously. . . 6:1-6 and 6:8 ff represent two different Stephen\nrenditions, which are juxtaposed but unrelated, neither explaining or being explained by\nthe other. . . \" p. 442. However, Marshal effectively rejects this position along\nwith the notion of Lukan forgery. Howard I. Marshall, <i>The Acts of the Apostles</i>, p.\n133,134. So also, Paul Trudinger, \"Stephen and the Life of the Primitive Church\"\nin <i>Biblical Theology Bulletin</i>, Vol. 14 No. 1 (Jan. 1984), pp. 20,21. See a short\nsurvey of source criticism attempts in Acts scholarship and their failures in Thomas Louis\nBrodie, \"Towards Unraveling the Rhetorical Imitation of Sources in Acts: 2 Kgs. 5 as\nOne Component of Acts 8,9-40,\" in <i>Biblica </i>Vol. 67 No. 1 (Winter 1986), pp.\n42,43. </p>\n\n<p>6F. D. Gealy, \"Steven,\" in <i>The Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible</i>,\np. 442.7On this point see J. H. Houlden, \"The Purpose of Luke,\" in <i>Journal\nfor the Study of the New Testament</i>, Vol. 21 (1984), pp. 53-65.8Astonishingly,\nTrudinger asserts that, \"We may justly wonder why it is that Luke has included this\nsection if indeed the tenor of it runs counter to the spirit of the rest of Acts.\"\n(!) Paul Trudinger, \"Stephen and the Life of the Primitive Church,\" in <i>Biblical\nTheology Bulletin</i>, Vol. 14 No. 1 (Jan. 1984), p. 20. </p>\n\n<p>9On the identity of what are called \"Hellenistai\" in vs. 1, see F. F. Bruce, <i>New\nTestament History</i>, (Garden City, NY: Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc., 1980), p. 219,\n\"That they [the hellenists] maintained a more liberal outlook than the `Hebrews',\nincluding the apostles, is evident from the sequel to the narrative of their\nelection.\" </p>\n\n<p>Some more radical critics think that the \"Hellenists\" were a splinter group\nin Judaism before the time of Christ. Their \"anti-temple, anti-ritualistic bias seems\nclear from Stephen's speech,\" comments Trudinger in what appears to be a circular\nargument. See Paul Trudinger, \"Stephen and the Life of the Primitive Church\" in <i>Biblical\nTheology Bulletin</i>, Vol. 14 No. 1 (Jan. 1984), p. 19. There is little doubt that there\nwere more liberally minded Jews known as Hellenists, but it is not clear that they were\nagainst the Temple or ritual. The only extra-biblical evidence adduced is an alleged\nsimilarity to the spirit of the Qumran community. The parallels, however, appear\nsuperficial. </p>\n\n<p>10Gealy is convinced wrongly that Stephen thinks there never should have been a temple.\nF. D. Gealy, \"Steven,\" in <i>The Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible</i>, p.\n442. But for a more balanced appraisal see, F. F. Bruce, <i>New Testament History</i>,\n(Garden City, NY: Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc., 1980), p. 223.11 Longnecker follows a\nvery similar line on Acts 7 in his exceptional commentary in the Expositors series.\nHowever, he does not relate to the sacred space notion, only to the area of sacred land.\nRichard N. Longnecker, \"The Acts of the Apostles,\" in <i>The Expositor's Bible\nCommentary</i>, Gabelein, Frank, E., Editor. </p>\n\n<p>12See Doble's interesting claim that \"hramata\" (speak against 6:13) means to\n\"utter oracles against\". This may be a reference to Stephen's quoting Jesus'\noracles against the temple in Lk. 19:41. P. Doble, \"The Son of Man Saying in\nStephen's Witnessing: Acts 6:8-8:2,\" in <i>New Testament Studies</i>, Vol. 31 (1985).\np. 69 see fn.14. </p>\n\n<p>13Mk. 14:58, 15:29, Jn. 2:19 all use naos, but Marshall cites them to demonstrated that\nthe phrase \"tou hagiou topou toutou\" means temple. Howard I. Marshall, <i>The\nActs of the Apostles</i>, p. 129. Knowling thinks the phrase could be referring also to\nthe assembly place of the Sanhedrin, also on the temple mount. R. J. Knowling, \"The\nActs of the Apostles.\" in <i>The Expositor's Bible Commentary</i>, Frank, E.\nGabelein, Editor, (Grand Rapids MI.: Zondervan Publishing House, 1978), Vol. II p. 177. </p>\n\n<p>14The phrase \"ho topos toutos\" (this place) is found exclusively in Luke-Acts\nin the New Testament, (sometimes in other cases). Once it is found in and Luke (16:28),\nand five times in Acts (6:13,14; 7:7; 21:28 twice). In 7:7 it is clearly referring to the\nland of Israel (see below). In 6:13,14 it is likely that the first reference may refer to\nthe land of Israel, and in 21:28 it is also possible that the first usage refers to the\nland rather than the temple. Only when \"hagiou\" is inserted does it become\nlikely that the temple is being referred to exclusively, and even then there is room for\ndoubt as noted above in note 13. Also see Knowling for a brief explanation of the textual\nproblem with this phrase in vs. 13. R. J. Knowling, \"The Acts of the Apostles.\"\nin <i>The Expositor's Bible Commentary</i>, Vol. II p. 177. The variant does not affect\nthe sense of the charge against Stephen. </p>\n\n<p>15Concerning the New and Old Testament's views of the land of Israel, Brown notes,\n\"One of the most striking differences between the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament.\n. .is the centrality of the Land in the Hebrew Bible and the apparent indifference to it\nin much of the New Testament.\" Wesley H. Brown, \"Christian Understandings of\nBiblical Prophecy, Israel and the Land, and the Christian-Jewish Encounter,\" in <i>Immanuel</i>,\nNo. 18. p. 87. He also cites W. D. Davies' work <i>The Gospel and the Land</i>,\n\"Christ has become for Paul the `locus' of redemption. . .once he had seen in Jesus\nhis Torah, he had in principle broken with the land. . .His geographical identity was\nsubordinated to that of being `in Christ'. . .\" p. 88. </p>\n\n<p>See Davies further for documentation on Jewish reverence for the sacredness of the\nland. W. D. Davies, <i>The Gospel and the Land</i>, (Berkeley: University of California\nPress, 1974), pp. 1-160. </p>\n\n<p>Also see Richard N. Longnecker, \"The Acts of the Apostles,\" p. 339. </p>\n\n<p>16On the chronological problem regarding the death of Terah see Howard I. Marshall, <i>The\nActs of the Apostles</i>, p. 135. </p>\n\n<p>17Gen. 15:13,14 Abraham was apparently standing near the Oaks of Mamre when God said\nthis. This would be near Hebron, well outside of the site of Jerusalem, but within the\nland of Israel.18Similarly, Howard I. Marshall, <i>The Acts of the Apostles</i>, p.\n137.19The jealousy evident in the patriarchs was also the driving force behind the\npersecution of Jesus according to all of the Gospel authors.20Howard I. Marshall, <i>The\nActs of the Apostles</i>, \"the interest in Shechem and the emphasis upon it is\nremarkable in a speech addressed to Jews in Jerusalem, but they certainly could not\ncontest the fact of Joseph's burial in the hated Samaritan territory.\" p. 139. If\nStephen erred in detail here (see Marshall above), such an error might not pose any more\nproblem for the inspiration of Acts than those cases where the disciples erred in the\ngospels (Compare Mt. 17:13 with Mk. 9:13). The author of Acts is not asserting these\nfacts, he is merely reporting a synopsis of the speech accurately. </p>\n\n<p>21Note that in vs. 37 Stephen cites the well known Messianic prediction that \"God\nwill send you a prophet like me from your own people,\"(Deut. 18:15). The implication\nhere is that King Messiah would be like Moses in all respects, including regular rejection\nby His own people.22This point is missed by Longnecker. Richard N. Longnecker, \"The\nActs of the Apostles,\" pp. 343,344.23Mircea Eliade, <i>Patterns in Comparative\nReligion</i>. (The World Publishing Co.,Cleveland OH, 1958), p. 370. A\n\"Heirophany\" is a manifestation of, or an encounter with, the sacred. </p>\n\n<p>24I Kings 6:1.25II Sam. 7:7.26Compare Paul Trudinger, \"Stephen and the Life of the\nPrimitive Church\" in <i>Biblical Theology Bulletin</i>, Vol. 14 No. 1 (Jan. 1984), p.\n20. \"The building of the temple . . .is another example of Israel's sin. The building\nof the temple is right on a par with the making of the golden calf, to Stephen's way of\nthinking.\" Here Trudinger woodenly equates the misunderstanding of the temple with\nthe building of it. See more correctly, P. Doble, \"The Son of Man Saying in Stephen's\nWitnessing: Acts 6:8-8:2,\" in <i>New Testament Studies</i>, Vol. 31 (1985). p. 79.\nThis essay has limited value, especially the unconvincing comparison of Stephen's speech\nand Wisdom. Even Longnecker thinks that vss. 44-47 express \"disapproval\" on\nStephen's part for the temple. Richard N. Longnecker, \"The Acts of the\nApostles,\" p. 346. </p>\n\n<p>27Modern critics have argued that the death of Stephen reflects the, \"beginning of\nan imatatio Christi motif in the biographies of the saints.\" If so, it is probably\nbecause of the influence of the Stephen text on later writers. Marcel Simon cited in Paul\nTrudinger, \"Stephen and the Life of the Primitive Church\" in <i>Biblical\nTheology Bulletin</i>, Vol. 14 No. 1 (Jan. 1984), p. 20. </p>\n\n<p>28So argues P. Doble, \"The Son of Man Saying in Stephen's Witnessing: Acts\n6:8-8:2,\" in <i>New Testament Studies</i>, Vol. 31 (1985), p. 69.29F. F. Bruce, <i>New\nTestament History</i>, (Garden City, NY: Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc., 1980), p.\n226.30This is denied by Bruce. F. F. Bruce, <i>New Testament History</i>, p. 226, but no\nreasons are given. For a curious but not very credible analysis of the martyrdom of\nStephen see Thomas Louis Brodie, O.P., \"The Accusing and Stoning of Naboth (1Kgs.\n21:8-13), as One Component of the Stephen Text (Acts 6:9-14; 7:58a),\" in The Catholic\nBiblical Quarterly, Vol.45, pp. 417-432. The author's effort to demonstrate that the\nnarrative portions of the account are adapted by Luke from the Naboth narrative is\ncompletely unconvincing. </p>\n\n<p>31Stephen, as a member of the \"Hellenistic\" group in the Jerusalem church,\nwas probably less encumbered with the ethnocentricity, ritualism, and traditionalism of\nthe \"Hebraic\" group in the Jerusalem church. The fact that Steven was chosen to\nrectify the inequity between these two groups suggests that, for whatever reason, he was\nmore free of the race and cultural prejudice that was still present in the Jerusalem\nchurch at this time. </p>\n\n<p>Bruce avers that, \"Stephen's attitude to the Temple betokens a much clearer\nappreciation of the incompatibility of the old order with the implications of the teaching\nof Jesus than appears to have been common among the early disciples in Jerusalem.\" F.\nF. Bruce, <i>New Testament History</i>, p. 223. </p>\n\n<p>Marshal concurs, \"It would seem likely that Steven went much farther that the\ntwelve in emphasizing this teaching [on the temple].\" Howard I. Marshall, <i>The Acts\nof the Apostles</i>, p. 128. </p>\n\n<p>32He refers to this event calling Stephen God's martyr in Acts 22:20. Note also the\ncharges brought against Paul in Acts 21:27ff, he preaches, \"against our people,\nagainst the law, and against this place\". Paul used arguments that were similar to\nStephen's, and may even have quoted him. See Acts 17:24-26 along with the excellent\ncomments by R. J. Knowling, \"The Acts of the Apostles.\" in <i>The Expositor's\nBible Commentary</i>, Vol. II p. 373.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/chhist.htm\">Go back to the Church History page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/summns.htm\">Go back to The Summons page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/stvn_a.htm\">Go back to the Strange Details Table of Contents</a> </p>\n\n<p>Download the whole \"Strange Details\" paper (32K) </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Bo back to the Xenos home page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Ask Dennis a\nquestion or share a comment.</a>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Strange Details in Stephen's Defense: A New Accounting IV","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/stvn4.htm"}

They were not evangelical in\ndoctrine, particularly in their soteriology, but they had important connections to later\nreform movements. Specifically, they earned the ire of the Roman church because they\ntranslated the Bible into the vernacular of their day, and allowed lay people to read it\nand preach it. They formed house churches all over Europe in spite of bitter persecution,\nincluding genocidal military campaigns. Their history contains important lessons for those\nwho would champion lay ministry today.</p>\n<p class=\"style1\">You can browse sections of the paper here, or <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/papers/waldo.zip\">download \n        the whole paper in Word 6.0 format(32K zipped file)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"style1\">Contents:</h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/chhist.htm\">Go back to the Church History page</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/equip.htm\">Go back to the Equipping Division page</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\">Go back to the Essays page</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/waldo2.htm\">Read on to the next section in \"Waldensians\"</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Go back to the Xenos home page</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=waldensian\">Ask\nDennis a question or share a comment.</a>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Waldensian Movement From Waldo to the Reformation","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/waldo1.htm"}

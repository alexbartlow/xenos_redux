Instead, He referred to the passages in Deut. 6:5, and\nLev. 19:18 which included love of God and love of one's neighbor. The latter notion is\nalso brought forward by Paul as the best way to understand the real intent of the\nDecalogue (Rom. 13:8-10). </p>\n\n<p>Therefore the Decalogue, which is itself a collection of ethical principles, can be\nfurther summarized under the heading of Christian love. This imperative to sacrifice self\nfor the glory of God and the well-being of others is very contentful and all-embracing. It\nincludes the possibility of discipline in love, so that it may confront one another in\nlove for his or her own good.24 </p>\n\n<p>Further than this, if we feel that the love principle should be applied in a way that\nis different than that done in the Bible, then the burden of evidence lies with the one\nwho would change. Why would Paul feel that lying was not as loving as truth-telling, but\nanother feels lying is justified? Perhaps if that one was named Rahab, she might be able\nto make a case (James 2:25). On the other hand there would be few such cases. </p>\n\n<p>There are also other ethical principles that may not be directly derived from the love\nprinciple. Holmes argues that justice is also a major ethic, although this is not as clear\nto me.25 Justice can indeed be inferred from natural law, but is less evident as an\nemphasis for Christian living than love. The doctrine of equality of all social classes,\nsexes, and races (Gal. 3:28) would imply justice in the sense of equity, but this would\nprobably not include the retributive aspects of justice, which are left to the civil\nauthorities, or to God.26 Therefore, it may only be the positive aspects of justice in the\nsense of fairness that the Christian should pursue, thus linking it again with love.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>IV. Ethical Prioritization</h3>\n\n<p>The issue of prioritization in ethics is often just as important as arriving at the\nethical principles in the first place. Examples abound of divergent groups whose practice\nand outlook are so different from each other that one could wonder if they are both\nreferring to the same book when they cite the Bible.27 Yet, upon closer examination it is\nfound that both groups hold essentially the same ethical views regarding the absolutes.\nThe difference in these cases stem from the area of prioritization. </p>\n\n<p>In some ways, prioritization is even more important than ethical methodology. This is\nbecause while methodology determines the correctness of what we say, prioritization\ndetermines what we actually do. </p>\n\n<p>The same principlizing hermeneutic that leads away from particularistic nomism in the\narea of theory, should also lead to a strong position on prioritization in practice.\nOtherwise, no matter what our theory is, we will wind up with nomism again. The real loser\nin such a situation would again be the \"weightier parts of the law\" (Mt. 23:23).\n</p>\n\n<p>Consider a teacher who forcefully argues that the heart of Christian integrity can be\nseen when a believer receives a letter with a stamp which is not canceled out. Will that\nbeliever re-use the stamp, or throw it away? Real Christian integrity, it is argued, will\nrefuse to steal a value that was not paid for! </p>\n\n<p>On close examination, no one can really refute this position with regard to whether it\nis morally right to steal. Unfortunately, both experience and the Bible show that this\nkind of fixation on the finer ethical details is usually indulged. Thus meaning, instead\nof a focus on the major issues, rather than in addition to it. Indeed, one must suppose\nthat this is one of the underlying appeals of this school of thought. Christ certainly\nimplied that it was in the case of the Pharisees. This is the practice He identified as\n\"straining out the gnat and swallowing the camel\" (Mt. 23:24). </p>\n\n<p>This practice of majoring on the minors is one of the great themes in both the history\nof the church, and of the modern scene. Wesley, who said that he would not tell the\nsmallest lie even in order to save the whole world from hell, was, in the view of most\nChristian analysts, guilty of gross misbehavior in his abortive marriage. The church has\nbeen infamous in most eras for insisting on painstaking compliance to unimportant details\nof personal \"holiness\" while saying nothing about cruel exploitation of other\nraces and the poor.28</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/ethic_a.htm\">Return to the Ethics table of contents</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Contact Dennis with a comment\nor question</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\">Return to the Essays page</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/ethic4.htm\">Read on to the next section in Ethics</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to the Xenos home page</a>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Toward An Approach to Christian Ethics III","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/ethic3.htm"}

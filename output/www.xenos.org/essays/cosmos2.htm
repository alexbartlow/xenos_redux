These cosmological descriptions originated from man's attempt to answer\nseveral fundamental questions about the universe: \n\n</p><ul>\n  <li>Why is there a universe? </li>\n  <li>Is the universe finite or infinite? </li>\n  <li>If finite then how big? </li>\n  <li>Did the universe always exist or did it have a beginning? </li>\n  <li>If the universe had a beginning then how did it come into being? </li>\n  <li>When did it come into being? </li>\n  <li>Where did it come into being? </li>\n  <li>What exists in the universe? </li>\n  <li>How do the contents of the universe behave and interact?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ancient cosmologies and even cosmologies emerging through the age of enlightenment were\nclosely intertwined with religious belief. Only within the last half-century or so has a\nspecialized science of cosmology emerged without making explicit mention of God or\ndeities. In these modern cosmologies immediate human concerns often appear to dwindle to\ninsignificance in the scale of cosmic time and space. Before the twentieth century it\noften seemed that any serious non-mythical investigation of the ordered universe led to a\nMover or a Designer who could be assimilated to the being whom men and women worshiped as\nGod.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos2.htm#Footnote1B\" name=\"Footnote1A\"> Footnote1</a> </p>\n\n<p>The following are brief summaries of the major cosmologies influencing western thought.\nThe progressive development toward modern scientific cosmologies can be detected in each\nsubsequent cosmology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Plato's Cosmology (428/427-348/347 B.C.)</b> - Plato's account takes the form of a\ncreation story, in the tradition of Greek mythologists. It is narrated by a philosopher\nnamed Timaeus of Locris (apparently a fictional character modeled on several of the\nPre-Socratics). In this account, the whole of nature is initiated by a creator divinity,\ncalled the \"Demiurge\" (the Geek word for 'craftsman'), who seeks, to the best\ndegree possible, to imitate through physical copies the ideally perfect structures of true\nbeing (i.e., the Ideas, or 'paradigms'). In this way he institutes the visible cosmos,\nthat is, the ordered domain of things that are susceptible of process and change (e.g.,\nbirth, growth, alteration, and dissolution - the realm of 'becoming,' genesis). The\nDemiurge himself only assembles the supreme model of the cosmos, the 'world soul', and\nthen delegates his divine subordinates to fit out the detailed structures of the parts of\nthe cosmos. It follows that the whole cosmic system is pervaded with analogical\nstructures, most notably, the human form, which becomes a copy of the whole - a microcosm,\nas it were - by virtue of the activity of these divine surrogates. All phenomena of nature\ncan be described as an interplay between the two forces of reason and necessity. He\nrepresents reason as constituting the world soul. The material medium (four elements of\nearth, air, water and fire) is introduced as the 'receptacle' representing the domain of\nnecessity. It is unclear whether Plato intended his cosmology as a literally true account\nof a created cosmos or a metaphysical fiction. Aristotle insisted that Plato must be held\nto his literal work, whereas Plato's immediate disciples favored a metaphorical reading.\nDivision of opinion has continued to the present day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Aristotle's Cosmology (384-322 B.C.)</b> - Aristotle's cosmology was to dominate\nthought in the Western World for more than 2,000 years and its overthrow is arguably the\nmajor achievement of Renaissance science. Aristotle's views on the organization and\nstructure of the universe are presented in De caelo. This work contains some of the basic\nconsiderations of motion. All locomotion is either straight, circular, or a combination of\nthe two; and all bodies are either simple (i.e., composed of a single element, such as\nfire or earth) or are compounds. The element fire and bodies composed of it have a natural\nmovement upward: bodies composed of earth have a natural movement downward (i.e., toward\nthe center of the universe which is the earth). Circular movement is natural to some\nsubstances other than the four elements and the circular movement is considered more\ndivine than these four elements (since circular motion is believed to be prior to straight\nmovement). Aristotle views the universe as two-spheres where the changing region is up to\nthe sphere of the moon, the earth is in the center surrounded by water, and air and fire\nare at the top, beyond which the heavenly bodies are in circular motion and in a realm\nwithout change. There is a separate set of physical laws for each of the two regions,\nsince they are composed of different types of matter. Aristotle argues that the universe\nis not infinite because the universe moves in a circle (as we can see with our eyes if we\nwatch the stars). If the universe were infinite, it would be moving though an infinite\ndistance in a finite time, which is impossible. This is an argument employing the method\nof reductio ad absurdum (i.e., showing that the premise leads to an absurd conclusion thus\nproving the opposite premise must be true). Aristotle claimed also that there was only one\nworld. He demonstrated this conclusion also using a reductio ad absurdum argument. If\nthere were more than one world, each world with a center as the natural place for earthy\nmaterial to move to and a circumference for fire to move to, then the earth could move\ntoward any of the centers and fire toward any of the circumferences. Chaos would ensue.\nSince we observe order instead of chaos then there must be only one world. Aristotle also\nshowed that the heavens rotate and that the earth is spherical, stationary and in the\ncenter of the heavenly sphere. In his arguments that the earth is spherical (based on the\ncircular shadow during eclipse and that different stars are seen from different parts of\nthe earth), Aristotle's use of observation is in stark contrast to Plato's rejection of\nthe evidence of the senses. This is seen by some historians as a turning point in science,\nmarking the beginning of extensive empirical investigations. However, Aristotle's\ncosmology has a number of teleological and animistic qualities that distinguish it from\nthe modern mechanical explanations. While bringing to Greek science a new emphasis on the\nvalue of observation, Aristotle still differs in important ways from modern scientific\npractice. For example his observations are used more to persuade his readers of the truth\nof his conclusions than as an aid in arriving at his conclusions. Also Aristotle does not\nconduct critical experiments with which to test his conclusions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Kant's Cosmology (1724-1804)</b> - Kant provided the first model of a scientific,\nalbeit highly speculative and qualitative, cosmology. His cosmology was thoroughly\nmechanistic and materialistic, but it makes clear that every cosmology must begin with the\nperception of a 'systematic constitution,' that could be viewed as evidence of some sort\nof 'grand design'. Although most of Kant's main tenets were mistaken, his work was of\nunprecedented scope, made detailed use of physical theory, and contained a number of\nfundamental insights. Kant's cosmological explanation takes the form of showing how the\n'systematic constitution' arose, by way of Newton's laws of motion and the law of\nuniversal gravitation, from an original chaos. The chaos consists of atoms or particles of\nmatter spread throughout an infinite space. According to Kant, the original chaos was\nunstable: the denser particles begin at once to attract the more tenuous. This is the\nexplanation of the origin of motion and the formation of bodies, eventually of the\nplanets. To prevent the universe from becoming one big massive ball Kant claims nature has\nstill other forces in store which especially evidence themselves when <i>'matter is\ndiluted into fine particles, whereby they repulse one another and through their conflict\nwith [the force of] attraction produce that motion which is, so to speak, and enduring\nlife of nature. Through this repulsive force, which reveals itself in the elasticity of\nvapors in the strongly smelling bodies and in the expansion of all spirituous matter and\nwhich is an indisputable phenomenon of nature, the elements sinking toward their points of\nattraction become directed side-wise in all sorts of ways and the perpendicular fall\nissues in circular motions which surround the center of sinking.'</i> Lateral motion thus\nresults when attractive and repulsive forces between any two bodies are equal and the one\nbody, following the path of least resistance, begins to orbit about the other. As this\nsummary indicates Kant's cosmology was largely qualitative. For example, he nowhere\nprovides a law, similar to that for attraction, by which the force of repulsion can be\ndetermined. It is also important to note that while Kant's cosmology was naturalistic he\nnever gave up the attempt to reconcile teleology and mechanism. In his Universal Natural\nHistory he claimed, that the very perfection of the mechanism in terms of which the\ndevelopment of the universe could be explained was at the same time the guarantee that it\nexisted for a purpose and was not simply the product of accident and chance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Modern Cosmology</b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos2.htm#Footnote2B\" name=\"Footnote2A\"> Footnote2</a> - Modern\nrelativistic cosmology emerged in the 20th century. A science in a technical sense can\nemerge only after its philosophical foundations have been clearly and distinctly laid.\nNevertheless, cosmology, like preceding scientific disciplines, seems to have developed\nits philosophical foundation by a largely unconscious process. The philosophical\nfoundation of a science involves three essential stances; metaphysical, epistemological,\nand methodological. These are outlined in Table 1. We define what it means to be\n\"scientific\" as consisting of some choice of a combination of positions held\nwithin each categorical stance: Metaphysics + Epistemology + Methodology. Without this\nfoundation we do not have a basis for stating 'what it is to be scientific'. The choice of\nthe specific position under each categorical stance is independent of the specific\nposition selected in the other categories. In other words the individual positions held\nwithin the metaphysical, epistemological, and methodological triad are mutually\nindependent choices that are selected without reference to the position held in each of\nthe other categorical stances. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><b>Table 1. Philosophical Basis For What It Means to Be Scientific</b></p>\n\n<table width=\"100%\" cellspacing=\"8\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"2\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"50%\"><b>Metaphysical Stances </b>This stance poses the question; \"What\n    sorts of entities, among those referred to by scientific statements, are to be understood\n    as actual existents?\" </td>\n    <td width=\"50%\"><b>Operationalism</b> - Only those entities that can be simply and\n    directly observed are to be counted as real. The entities involved are those that may be\n    defined by some sort of operation with various physical instruments or equipment.\n    <p><b>Explanatory Realism</b> - This position adopts as an existence criterion something\n    like \"If a theoretical entity <b>e </b>must be hypothesized in order to explain\n    observable phenomenon <b>p</b>, then <b>e </b>exists.\" </p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"50%\"><b>Epistemological Stances </b>In this stance the question is asked;\n    \"What are the legitimate sources of scientific knowledge?\"</td>\n    <td width=\"50%\"><b>Empiricism</b> - Only information from observational and experimental\n    results are acceptable as a source for cosmological theorizing. Scientific knowledge is\n    founded in sensory observation. <p><b>Rationalism </b>- It is permissible for cosmologists\n    to originate their theoretical efforts in very general ideas about what the universe\n    should be like.</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"50%\"><b>Methodological Stances </b>The question related to this stance is;\n    \"What are the acceptable procedures for constructing a scientific theory?\" </td>\n    <td width=\"50%\"><b>Hypothetico-deductivism (H-D'ism)</b> - Hypotheses are generated on the\n    basis of general ideas about the universe, and then the consequences of these hypotheses\n    are deduced with the hope that at least some of the consequences involve observational\n    possibilities.\n    <p><b>Inductivism</b> - Logical induction is used to produce generalizations and\n    extrapolations based on solid observational and experimental information.</p></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>One of the relatively popular choices among several scientific fields is:\nOperationalism + Rationalism + H-D'ism. Another choice that has been identified is:\nOperationalism + Empiricism + Inductivism. Perhaps the most typical position of a physical\nscientist is: Realism + Empiricism + Inductivism. In the case of modern relativistic\ncosmology it was Operationalism + Rationalism + H-D'ism that ended up providing the\nphilosophical model. The main point is that within science itself there are\ninconsistencies between what it means to be scientific from one discipline to the next.\nThis is important because understanding the philosophical basis for a scientific\ninterpretation of nature is an essential first step for a rational critique of the\nconflict between scientific cosmology and biblical cosmology. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos2.htm#Footnote1A\" name=\"Footnote1B\">Footnote1</a></p>\n\n<p>Norriss S Hetherington (Editor), <i>ENCYCLOPEDIA OF COSMOLOGY</i>, Historical,\nPhilosophical, and Scientific Foundations of Modern Cosmology, Garland Publishing, Inc.,\n1993.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos2.htm#Footnote2A\" name=\"Footnote2B\">Footnote2</a></p>\n\n<p>Norriss S Hetherington (Editor), <i>ENCYCLOPEDIA OF COSMOLOGY</i>, Historical,\nPhilosophical, and Scientific Foundations of Modern Cosmology, Garland Publishing, Inc.,\n1993.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos3.htm\">\n\n<p>Read on to the next section in \"Cosmology\"</p></a>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmosa.htm\">Return to the Table of Contents</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/xessays.htm\">Return to the Crossroads Essays page</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to the Xenos home page</a> \n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n</p>\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"COSMOLOGY II","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos2.htm"}

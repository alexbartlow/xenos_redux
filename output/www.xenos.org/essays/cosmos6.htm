The purpose of the world is usually attributed to \n        the support of life, especially mankind. The antithesis of this view is \n        that the world has no purpose. In this view life came about by events \n        that were the result of blind chance. The appearance of design in nature \n        from a scientific cosmological stance is thoroughly addressed by Ross<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos6.htm#Footnote1B\" name=\"Footnote1A\">Footnote1</a>. \n      </p>\n\n<p>The argument for design is usually based on the fine-tuning of various physical\nconstants in order for the world to exist as we know it, and thus, provide the environment\nnecessary to support life. The counter argument to this view has frequently been that\ndesign was not necessary to produce a world capable of supporting life because it could\nhave happened by chance. The proponents of this latter view have appealed to two\ncosmological theories (steady state and oscillating universe theories) that they argued\nmade this chance event (life) a reasonably likely one. The steady state cosmology asserted\nan infinitely old universe in which our planet eventually emerged by blind chance. Thus\nthere had been ample time for the necessary conditions to arise that could both produce\nand support life. The oscillating universe cosmology asserted the universe expanded and\ncollapsed thus coming in and out of existence for an infinite period of time until it\nfinally produced the world we happen to have at the moment and are able to observe. That\nis, the conditions for supporting life accidentally occurred in this particular\noscillation. The current scientific evidence supports the standard or 'big bang' cosmology\nwhich indicates that the universe is a one time event of fairly recent occurrence\n(approximately 15 billion years ago). For the proponents of blind chance this reduces the\nlikelihood of a fine-tuned universe that could support life to an extremely (perhaps\nincomprehensibly) small probability.</p>\n\n<p>According to the standard 'big bang' model the world as it is (long-lived, populated by\ngalaxies of stars, and containing appreciable quantities of the heavier elements) was\nproduced by a series of events requiring an extraordinarily precise balance of initial\nconditions and of the laws governing the four fundamental forces<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos6.htm#Footnote2B\" name=\"Footnote2A\">Footnote2</a>. Even slight changes in these and the universe might have\nbeen short lived; either collapsing on itself, or expanding too rapidly for matter to form\ninto stars or planets and perhaps consisting only of the light elements (such as helium or\nhydrogen). The anthropic principle was proposed by B. J. Carr, Martin Rees, and several\nother British cosmologists to explain this fine tuning without having to appeal to the\ntheistic alternative of a creator or a 'fine-tuner'. In 1981 Alan Guth proposed a\nmodification to the standard model involving a rapid expansion or inflation during the\nfirst fraction of a second of cosmic formation. This was proposed to eliminate part of the\nneed for 'fine-tuning'. This introduced new problems however and is still under debate. </p>\n\n<p>The force behind the metaphorical argument of fine-tuning depends on establishing a\nspecial sort of contingency or unlikelihood that requires explanation. The main appeal of\nquantum cosmology ('big bang' model) to Christian believers is that scientific theory\nseems to point to a state of affairs that would itself require an explanation of a\nreligious nature (that is a beginning or act of creation). Unlike all other such leads in\nthe past, this was one would not require an alteration by fiat of natural process on the\npart of the Creator but possibly just a creative setting of the original stage. Paul\nDavies<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos6.htm#Footnote3B\" name=\"Footnote3A\">Footnote3</a> has found this possible\nconnection between scientific cosmology and theistic belief appealing. However, most\nscientific theories, especially theories regarding the origin and formation of the\nuniverse, are tentative and what now appears contingent can later turn out to be necessary\nafter all. Extreme caution should be exercised in associating ones faith with the current\ntrend in cosmological theory. These trends can change rapidly and it can be very\ndisorienting to base one's faith on an erroneous theory. On the other hand the popularity\nof Stephen Hawking's, A Brief History of Time (1988), may be partially derived from his\nvague remarks about the negative implications of recent cosmology for belief in a Creator\n(along the lines that there would be nothing for a creator to do and the existence of\nmatter may just be a result of a vacuum fluctuation). </p>\n\n<p>The opposition between the concepts of design versus chance can also be cast in terms\nof evolution of the formation of the universe. The end result of processes, supernatural\nor natural, leading to the physical existence of the universe is a perceived order. The\nquestion is; did the occurrence of these events proceed by supernatural design or natural\nprocesses? Design implies a certain necessary sequence of occurrence of each event to\nachieve a purpose (i.e., to produce the specific universe that exists). Although there may\nexist a number of possible contingent events, any one of which can occur, the occurrence\nof certain specific events are necessary to produce the world as it is. Necessity normally\nimplies a deterministic character of events to achieve a purpose. Here we are referring to\nthe circumstance where the event is a necessary cause to produce the desired effect but\nthe occurrence of the event is contingent. That is, to produce a universe of a particular\ndesign, a particular event must occur but there existed the possibility of other events\noccurring so that the selected event occurred as a result of choice not physical\ndeterminism (i.e., there is something for a Creator to do). On the other hand chance\nimplies an absence of purpose and leads to a view of processes as a disordered series of\nchaotic events connected by physical determinism. The principle of design would have us\nbelieve that the universe as it exists took its specific form for a purpose. The principle\nof chance would have us believe that the universe is a product of accident and its\nformation was devoid of purpose. One must be careful at this point to then claim that the\nbelief in the existence of chance on any metaphysical level is anti-biblical. While there\nare those who believe that 'chance' and 'god' are antithetical there are Christian\nbelievers who do not hold such a view. Donald MacKay makes the following argument that\nchance is not antithetical to the Christian world view. The following is an excerpt. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos6.htm#Footnote4B\" name=\"Footnote4A\">Footnote4</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this antithesis between 'god' and 'chance' a genuinely biblical one? If not,\nChristians have no brief to defend it. There are two kinds of chance. In science chance is\nused as a technical term to mean the absence of knowledge of causal connections between\nevents. In popular usage, the word tends to take on a different shade of meaning, as\nchaos, the antithesis of intelligence, - 'blind chance'. It is this metaphysical notion,\noften virtually personified as an alternative to God, that our grandfathers obviously\nmeant to resist, and that many unbelieving scientists apparently felt bound to defend in\nthe name of 'science'. It rather looks as if, in the nineteenth century debates on the\nrole of 'chance' in biology, the two senses of the word became hopelessly confused, so\nthat 'Science' gained (on both sides) the reputation of making metaphysical assertions\nwhich no amount of biological fact could ever justify, while the Bible got the reputation\n(again, alas, on both sides) of denying the validity of a purely technical, and\ntheologically neutral, scientific notion. Chance in the sense of chaos is indeed\nrecognized in the bible (Genesis 1:2), but only as something banished from the world by\nGod's creative word. Chance in the neutral sense in which we first defined it, however is\naccepted in a very different spirit. 'The lot is cast into the lap, but the decision is\nwholly from the Lord (Proverbs 16:33). Could there be a clearer indication that God is the\nLord of events which in this sense 'happen by chance', just as much as of those that seem\norderly to us? The Bible does not tolerate the idea that He must always work in a way that\nappears orderly from the view point of man.</p>\n\n<p>An author of anti-Christian persuasion who is both better known and less insensitive\nthan most is Sir Julian Huxley, and a well-known article of his entitled 'The Evolutionary\nVision', (from Issues in Evolution, pp. 249-261, in volume III of <i>Evolution after\nDarwin</i>, edited by Sol Tax and Charles Callender (Univ. of Chicago Press, 1961), may\nfairly be cited as a present-day example of the philosophical 'Evolutionism' versus the\ntechnical theory of evolution. In it he says:'In the evolutionary pattern of thought there\nis no longer either need or room for the supernatural. The earth was not created; it\nevolved.... Evolutionary man can no longer...absolve himself from the hard task of meeting\nhis present problems and planning his future by relying on the will of an omniscient, but\nunfortunately inscrutable, Providence.' Again G. G. Simpson, after showing that\n(technical) chance could 'account for' biological development, concludes dogmatically:\n'Man is the result of a purposeless and materialistic process that did not have him in\nmind. He was not planned.' (This is from G. G. Simpson, <i>The Meaning of Evolution</i>\n(Yale, 1949). </p>\n\n<p>Finally, as recently as 1971, we find the distinguished biologist Jacques Monod arguing\nthat 'Pure chance, absolutely free but blind, (is) at the very root of the stupendous\nedifice of evolution': and that therefore 'man at last knows (sic) that he is alone in the\nunfeeling immensity of the universe.... Neither his destiny nor his duty have been written\ndown'. (from <i>Chance and Necessity</i>, Collins, 1971, pp.110, 167.) Here are all the\nmarks of the confusion outlined above. The evolution of the created order is thought of as\nan alternative that excludes its having been created; and divine help and Providence are\ntaken as exclusive alternatives to human effort. (see Phil 2:12 as an example how this is\ncounter to Christian thought.) We have here a confusion between technical evolutionary\ntheory and 'the evolutionary pattern of thought', with the inevitable implication (however\nunintentional) that it is scientific fact which leaves 'no...room for the supernatural'. </p>\n\n<p>The blunt truth, that no scientific fact can say anything either for or against the\nsupernatural, makes such dogmatism hard to distinguish from sheer wishful thinking.\nCertainly it has no basis in logic. Christians have here a constructive task of\nclarification, in which not only the bible but also the nature of science itself support\nthem as they seek to bring such misrepresentation to an end.</p>\n\n<p>The idea that the biological theory of evolution supports anti-christian 'Evolutionism'\nis false; and it would be a shame for any Christian literature to align itself with\natheistic rationalism in continuing to give currency to it. The parasite should be exposed\nfor what it is, leaving Christians more free than anyone else to enjoy following the trail\nof God-given scientific clues to the past he has created, giving him glory for whatever\nunfolding picture they reveal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, it is important to keep in mind that physicalism is a philosophical\npresupposition of science not a scientific conclusion. Thus, given this presupposition, if\norder \"evolves\" from chaos it must be \"chance\" or an undiscovered\nphysical law and not \"mind\" unless it is human mind (which violates the temporal\nor sequential requirements of cause and effect (although various forms of the anthropic\nprinciple call for this) or perhaps a form of panpsychism. This argument can take the form\nnecessary for a valid logical deduction but the soundness of the argument rests on the\ntruth of the presupposition. Thus the perhaps valid but unsound logical deduction is\nconfused with a true scientific conclusion.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/cosmos6.htm#Footnote1A\" name=\"Footnote1B\">Footnote1</a></p>\n\n<p>14.

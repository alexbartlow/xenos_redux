Ancient people were not as interested in geographic and chronological details as we\nare.</h5>\n\n<ul class=\"style1\">\n  <li>Gadarenes (Mt. 8:28) and Gerasenes (Mk. 5:1) refer to two cities in the same region. </li>\n  <li>Luke refers to the new site of Jericho (Lk. 18:35), while Matthew and Mark refer to old\n    Jericho (Mt. 20:29; Mk. 10:46). </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">2. The authors often arranged their material topically, not chronologically.</h5>\n\n<ul class=\"style1\">\n  <li>Mt. 8, 9 is a list of miracles which Jesus did throughout the course of this ministry. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">3. Jesus was an itinerate speaker. Therefore, He often repeated both teachings and\nactions in different places and times.</h5>\n\n<ul class=\"style1\">\n  <li>The sermon on mount (Mt. 5-7) and the sermon on the level place (Lk. 6) are probably\n    different discourses. </li>\n  <li>Jesus cleansed the Temple twice: once at beginning of His ministry (Jn. 2) and once at\n    the end (Mt., Mk., Lk.). </li>\n  <li>The incident with Mary and the perfume (Jn. 12; Mt. 26; Mk. 14) is probably different\n    from similar incident recorded in Lk. 7. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">4. The authors used great selectivity in their accounts (Jn. 20:31; 21:25) and greatly\ncompressed what they reported.</h5>\n\n<ul class=\"style1\">\n  <li>There are 2 Garasene demonics (Mt. 8; Lk. 8), but Mark focuses on one of them. </li>\n  <li>There are 2 blind men healed (Mt. 20; Lk. 18), but Mark focuses on one of them. </li>\n  <li>Matthew often compresses accounts (Mt. 8:5-13; 9:18). </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 class=\"style1\">5. Authors had to translate, interpret and condense Jesus' words and actions.</h5>\n\n<ul class=\"style1\">\n  <li>Jesus probably spoke in Aramaic, but the gospels are written in Greek </li>\n  <li>This explains slightly different versions of the same quotations (Compare Mt.24:3; Mk\n    13:4; Lk.21:7). </li>\n  <li>We don't always know where the quotation ends and the application begins (Jn. 3:10-21;\n    Gal.2:14-21). </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/outlines.htm\">Return to the Outlines page</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to the Xenos home page</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=harmonizing\">Ask\nDennis a question or share a comment.</a> </p>\n\n<p><span class=\"style1\"><a href=\"mailto:DeLashmuttG@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Ask Gary a question or\nshare a comment.</a></span> </p>\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Harmonizing the Synoptic Gospels","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/harmony.htm"}

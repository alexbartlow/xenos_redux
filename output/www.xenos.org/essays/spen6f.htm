His dual calls for the individual believers to divide the\nScriptures, while not infringing on the prerogatives of the clergy were probably\nself-contradictory in practice. At least the clergy would make these calls mutually\nexclusive. Tappert says, </big></p>\n\n<p><big>It is hardly surprising that the initial enthusiasm for the <i>Pia Desideria </i>cooled\nsomewhat when the implications of one or another of these planks in Spener's platform\nbecame clearer. Clergymen felt threatened in their status by the rise of the laity,\nprofessors of theology resented the brash incursion of outsiders into their academic\npreserve, and the complacent were disturbed by appeals or change and for departure from\nwhat was familiar, customary, and comfortable.204 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>In spite of his determination to abide within the confines of his own confession,\nSpener tended to resist the structural strongholds of the status quo. When his critics\npushed the idea that the collegiate clergy alone had the authority to interpret\nsufficiently in the symbols, Spener observed that, \". . .one pope would be better\nthan many popes.\"205 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Viewed this way, separatism, and the Radical Pietistic revolt were the logical\noutgrowth of Spener's theology--not confused distortions of it. Spener's own cries against\nseparatism and anti-clericalism have a hollow ring when heard in the light of his call for\na return to more radically biblical principles. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Spener, unlike many of his contemporaries, said the Symbolical Books206 are of\nhuman origin, and while God has provided so that they would not contain errors in basic\ndoctrines which are necessary for salvation, He did permit errors in secondary matters to\nremind us of the distinction between the Symbolical Books and the Holy Scriptures. 207 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>These chippings at the foundations of the established orthodoxy proved to be a\ndoor which, once opened even a little, could not be closed again. The followers who took\nthe Pietistic teachings to an extreme, both in soteriology and in ecclesiology tended to\nbecome very perfectionistic and hard to please. Some of them felt that separation from the\nworld was the only to reach the ideal of inward perfection implied in some of the mystical\nthought used by Pietists. When separating one's self from the wicked world, what could be\nmore wicked than the control hungry established denominations? Surely one must separate\nhimself from man's church as well as from man's society. </big></p>\n\n<h3><big>Arnold</big></h3>\n\n<p><big>An example par excellence of the kind of hyper-idealistic individualism that grew\nout of this \"inward\" view of Christianity can be seen in the ecclesiology of\nGottfried Arnold. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Arnold had experienced a religious awakening while studying law at Wittemberg,\napparently as a result of Spener's ministry.208 He was discipled by Spener for about two\nyears while a tutor at Dresden. Later, Spener got him a posting to teach at Quedlinburg,\nwhich happened to be a hot-bed of separatism at that time.209 There he produced his first\nmajor work on early church history--Wahre Abbildung. As a result of this book, he was\ngiven the professorship of church history at Giessen in 1697. There he had extensive\ncontact with Gichtel and Hochman (see below). Gichtel was a Boehmist, although this is not\nas clear in the case of Hochman. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Arnold's study of church history and the early church led him to feel that there\nwas no church or sect in which a truly God-seeking person could retain his devotion to\nChrist without severe hindrances. Eventually, \"Arnold comes to doubt that the\nrequisite inwardness of the true church can ever be exhibited by a community\nagain.\"210 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Not surprisingly, he eventually came to depreciate the value of all forms of\noutwardness including the sacraments. He sees the Kingdom of God as preeminently\ninward.211 Arnold's super-spiritual critical view eventually leads him to render a\nnegative verdict on every expression of the church that he considered in his other major\nwork on church history, the Ketzerhistorie. 212 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Stoffer says, \"Arnold's trademark is clearly discernible: the necessity of\nlooking to the early church as the norm for Christian life.\"213 The subjugation of\necclesiology to the doctrines of personal piety is denied by Stoffer. However, he admits\nthat </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>. . .the renewal of the individual and the work of the Holy Spirit. . . are given\n  added force in the Ketzerhistorie. . . .for the life of the regenerate man becomes the\n  standard for judging all aspects of church history.214 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3><big>Hochman</big></h3>\n\n<p><big>Another renown Pietistic dissenter was Ernst Christoph Hochman. His <i>Glaubensbekenntnis</i>\n(published in 1743) is considered, \"a reliable credenda of the Schwarzenau\nmovement,\" which included the early German Baptist Brethren. 215 Hochaman tends to\nagree with many of Arnold's views in <i>Ketzerhistorie</i>. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Hochman was a traveling evangelist, more or less in the tradition of the mendicant\n(beggar) preachers of earlier times. He eventually settles for some time in the province\nof Wittgenstein. This province, under the rule of a Count Henry, needed more citizens for\ntax purpose. It therefore began welcoming religious dissenters and separatists of every\nstripe from as far away as Switzerland. These included Mennonites, Labadists, Lutheran\nPietists, and Quakers. 216 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>That Hochman's influence on the German Brethren movement was a lasting one, is\ndemonstrated by the fact that his Glaubensbekenntnis was brought to America by the\nBrethren, and was published by the Germantown press of Christopher Sauer in 1743.217 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>It is interesting to note that Hochman, like Spener may have been influenced by\nLabadie. We know he visited Labadist cells in Krefeld Holland, which also became the later\nhome of some of the German Baptist Brethren. 218 Krefeld was at that time (between 1683\nand 1720) a key rallying point for Separatists. Even before Hochman preached there, the\ninclination for `separation' had been planted. 219 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>The European Origins of the Brethren, by Donald F. Durnmaugh is the most complete\ncollection of early German Baptist Brethren and radical pietistic documents available in\ntranslation. It contains many fascinating authentic letters and records of interrogations,\netc. which portray the reactions and outlooks of the people involved in the clearest, and\nmost reliable way. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>A feel for the poignance of a life of free-form revolutionary agitation can be\ngained by reading an exchange of letters between a Palatine official at Mannheim and the\nElector Palatine regarding the town's response to an incident where several adults had\nbeen baptized by Hochman and Mack. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>When the official at Mannheim reported that several citizens had been baptized as\nadults, and asked for guidance, the Elector published an edict that read in part, </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>[those]...who profess this error and hold secret conventicles in homes or\n  elsewhere, [shall be] carefully watched, especially the leaders. Those who commit this\n  evil and who do not respond either to kingly or severe warnings to abandon these wicked\n  intentions and maintain this especially stubbornly are to be arrested at once without\n  special authorization. They are to be put in prison, and as many of them as there are must\n  be locked to wheelbarrows and kept on public work on the fortifications or at other common\n  labor. They are to be separated from one another in various places, and put on a\n  bread-and-water diet. September 14, 1706. </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>In response to this the local official arrested a few Taufgesinnten [baptism\nfactionaries] and reported the result, </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>On the basis of this, they were sentenced to public labor on the Neckar River in\n  the hope that others of their ilk would be intimidated. However, it is impossible to\n  describe what a great sympathy all of the Reformed subjects have shown for them. They have\n  defended the Pietists' teachings, and said that nothing could be found deserving\n  punishment in such pious Christians as far as they could see or hear. They have\n  unashamedly proclaimed and made this their own cause. In addition, they immediately began\n  going in processions to the prisoners outside of the city, not out of curiosity, but to\n  spend all day listening to them. The prisoners preached continually instead of doing the\n  assigned labor. They have also sent them plenty to eat and drink despite the published\n  prohibition. </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>The civil guard appointed to watch them was powerless to prevent this, and was no\n  longer sure of his own safety because of the open threats against him. I was finally\n  forced to request a military guard and ordered him to go there. The latter gave the\n  leader, the so-called Hochmann, a few harmless blows, because the latter would neither\n  stop his continual preaching nor accommodate himself to working. </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>This caused such compassion, tumult, and exaggeration from the Reformed party as\n  if these \"innocent\" people were being treated barbarously, so that an open\n  rebellion was to be feared. This was even though I had released the two local citizens\n  among the prisoners upon their declaration that they would again profess the Reformed\n  faith. The Reformed party demonstrated such an unusual hatred for me because of this that\n  one can obviously see that most of the Reformed have fallen prey to this Pietistic error\n  and conspire with them.\" </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>\"It is my humble opinion that a still harsher edict should be drawn up\n  against this Pietistic sect and their defenders.\" </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>Instead, the elector answered, </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>. . .As the prisoners have obediently appealed again for merciful amelioration by\n  the enclosed submissive petition, we have thereupon graciously resolved to dismiss the\n  same at this time. They are to be expelled with the stern warning that they must never set\n  foot in Mannheim or any other place in the territory. . .220 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>Life in a society where no churches were permitted other than the three already\nrecognized was a constant adventure for separatist agitators like Hochman. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Hochman's views on baptism can be detected in the following response to Christian\nLiebe, </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>Hochmann von Hochenau to Christian Liebe </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>Concerning the matter of the baptism, it is my impartial opinion that baptism by\n  fire and spirit must take place in every Christian. Where this does not occur in the soul,\n  the outward water baptism alone without the inward one can make a Christian of no one.\n  Before God in Christ, only the new creature has value. In faith working through love is\n  found the entire essence of Christianity. Indeed, I believe that where one is outwardly\n  baptized, even as an adult, that cannot possibly help one to salvation, if the person has\n  not been inwardly sanctified in the body, soul, and spirit of Jesus.221 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>Likewise with communion, </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>When this is held by living members of Christ in truly united love, then I will\n  not oppose it. To the contrary, in as far as they wish to ally themselves with me in life\n  and death for the sake of the name of Jesus, I will take communion with them. However,\n  without the inward alliance with the spirit of Jesus, the outward will avail little or\n  nothing at all.222 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>Here we see in Hochman an example of complete inward focus, usually only found\namong quietists such as Quakers. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>When the official tried to enlist the aid of the reformed pastor in an\ninquisitorial fashion, he found that the pastor was a moderate, uninterested in being a\nTaufjager [baptist hunter]. </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>Inspector Konig to Count Charles August </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>If there is anything wrong with this type of baptismal act, it is that their\n  baptism is commonly not a sacrament of unity and brotherly fellowship with all believers\n  and God-fearing people but rather a sacrament of separation and partisan spirit.223 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>Of course in Hochman's view, no one could have been less partisan than he, since\nhe did not recognized the validity of any confessional distinctions. </big></p>\n\n<h3><big>Mack</big></h3>\n\n<p><big>Alexander Mack wrote three tracts that we know of, but only two survive. Also one\nletter remains. The titles are a little hard to remember. One is, </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>A Short and Simple Presentation of the Outward, yet Sacred Rights and Ordinances\n  of the House of God, as Commanded by the True Steward Jesus Christ, and Left on Record in\n  His Last Will and Testament. Arranged in a Conversation between Father and Son through\n  Questions and Answers. 224 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>For obvious reasons historians refer to this work as <i>Rechte und Ordnungen</i>,\n[Rites and Ordinances]. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>The other work that has survived has a similarly long title, but is usually called\n<i>Ground Searching Questions </i>[<i>Grundforschende Fragen</i>]. 225 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>The other main source matter comes from Alexander Mack Jr.'s Introduction to the\n1774 edition of <i>Rites and Ordinances </i>which gives a short history of the formation\nof the movement using some verbal and written materials he got from his father and Elder\nPeter Becker, long time leader of the Germantown Brethren. 226 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Mack traveled and preached with Hochman for at least two years. He considered\nhimself Hochman's disciple until he decided to form a new church community that followed\nthe New Testament pattern more faithfully. In a letter to a critic, he explains his view\nof the established churches: </big></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><big>The Baptist seed is still far better than the seed of L[uther], C[alvin], and also\n  that of the C[atholics]. These have had a completely wild, yes, bestial outcome, which is\n  self-evident. The Jews and the Turks are scandalized by the horrible wickedness of these\n  three religions. Not even with gallows and torture can they keep them, who are of one\n  faith, from murdering one another in their homes, which happens often enough. What is\n  still more horrible, they go publicly to war, and slaughter one another by the thousands.\n  All this is the fruit of infant baptism.227 </big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><big>Their story begins in one of the most popular refuges for separatists in\nGermany--Schwarzenau. Here Mack and his new wife came between 1700 and 1708. It was in\n1708 that eight adults formed a <i>Gemeinde</i>, (parish or community) by having\nthemselves baptized three times forward in the name of the Father the Son, and the Holy\nSpirit. 228 Hochman, who was opposed to all sects and all ecclesiastical organization, was\ndisappointed in his followers for forming a new sect.\"229 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Krefeld in northern Holland later became the center of the movement because of\neven greater religious toleration there. Earlier, in 1678, Stephen Crisp, and English\nQuaker, had established the first Quaker meeting at Krefeld. Two years later they were\ndriven out of town, and in 1683 most of them went to America. As already seen, the\nLabadists had founded separatist cells there as well.230 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Mack's group were \"<i>taufgesinnten</i>\" which means baptism sectaries,\nbaptism variants, or baptism dissenters. The word is usually translated\n\"baptists.\" They were also christened \"Tunkers\" [from tunkel- to dip]\nand \"Dunkards.\" 231 Brethren historians refer to the movement as the German\nBaptist Brethren. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Mack Jr. explains that \"Here and there private meetings (<i>Versammlungen</i>)\nwere established next to the organized churches, in which newly awakened souls sought\ntheir edification. . .the [presence of] the spiritual priest [see above \"Church\nOrder\"] embittered the hearts of the rulers, and . . .persecutions were started. .\n.\" 232 They were persecuted because they baptized adults, causing the nobility to\nthink that they were <i>Wiedertaufern </i>(Anabaptists). Civil authorities were terrified\nof Anabaptism, for, \"it was essentially a lower class movement.\" </big></p>\n\n<p><big>They eventually followed the Quakers to Penn's colony in America, where religious\ntoleration was practiced. Three books popular with the early Brethren were: Johann Arndt, <i>Wahres\nChristendom</i>; Gottfried Arnold, <i>Abbildung der ersten Christen</i>; and Jeremais\nFeldbinger, <i>Christliches Hand-Buchen</i>. 233 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Today the Brethren movement in America goes on under several denominational\nlabels. These include the Ashland Brethren, the Brethren in America, and the Grace\nBrethren. 234</big></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><big>The Legacy of Pietism in History</big></h3>\n\n<p><big>The final impact of Pietism is so far reaching in history that it is impossible to\nanalyze fully here. The mere existence of the Wesleyan, Brethren and Moravian churches\nindicate terrific impact. Then there was the effect on the Lutheran church. This has been\ndiscussed in works by Stoeffler, Harnack, and Ritschl to name a few.235 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Pietism is usually admitted to have influenced numerous other churches including\nthe Mennonites, the Puritans, the Quakers, and Dutch Reformed in early America. We know\nthat the New England Puritan Cotton Mather corresponded with Francke for instance.236 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>In society outside of the church, Pietism is credited with contributing to the\nimpetus for a spirit of tolerance and religious freedom.237 Johann Wolfgang Goethe, and\nImmanuel Kant are examples of important secular thinkers who were heavily exposed to\nPietism in their youth. Noll even [wrongly, I think] goes as far as seeing Pietistic\ninfluence in Jansenism and the visions of the Jewish mystic Baal Shem Tov!238 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Some of the evaluations of Pietism's impact are quite negative.239 It is hard to\ndeny that hyper-individualism is a danger inherent in the movement. Today, much of\nAmerican fundamentalism draws its primarily inward devotional ethic from Pietistic\nsources. In a different vein, Noll, speaking from an apparently sentimental, rather than a\nbiblical perspective, worries that Pietism \"can underrate the value of Christian\ntraditions.\"240 Others would say that this is the main value of the movement. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Regarding Ecclesiology, the great themes that Spener brought to light in the area\nof lay-ministry are arguably the most revolutionary and positive truths uncovered by the\nReformation. The outburst of excitement for Christianity that resulted (even though\ntemporary in many cases) was enough to impact most of the world before it had spent its\nforce. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Heyd points out that we need to consider not only the moves made by the Pietists\nand related \"inner life\" groups, but also to study the reaction of the\nestablished churches. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>The reactions of the establishment itself, or of `structure' to the challenges of\nthe radicals has usually received less attention, although such a reaction may be no less\ninteresting . . .than the thought and action of the radicals.241 </big></p>\n\n<p><big>He points out that \"the `anti-structural' character of enthusiasm was\nstressed above all by its contemporary critics.\" As a result, It was, \". .\n.important to emphasize the time-bound character of scripture and to supplement it by a\nreliance on the Church as the embodiment of the religious order and as the only legitimate\ninterpreter of the scriptural message.\"242 Thus, like the Quakers, the \"latitude\nmen\" and the Anabaptists, the Pietists may have had the unintended effect in some\nconfessions of stiffening institutional criteria for authority. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>By far more significant however, are two central emphases reintroduced by the\nPietists, that have remained as key elements of much of conservative Christianity\nespecially in America. These are the emphasis on a personal relationship with God (usually\nattended by the belief in the need for a defined conversion experience) and the emphasis\non evangelism and missions. Both of these have a bearing on ecclesiology. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>The distinction between true (i.e. converted) Christians and nominal Christians\nrelates to the definition of the true, or invisible, church. As already seen, this\ntendency led in part to the separatism of the radicals, and has led to various attempts at\nfounding \"believers only\" churches.243 This development has tended to fade in\nimportance because of the difficulties inherent in the view. However, the distinction has\ncontinued to carry weight with fundamentalist groups, many of which have set out to\nconvert the nominal Christians in existing churches. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>The emphasis on missions has had a resounding impact in redefining the nature of\nthe church's mission. Views that the church is simply intended to worship rightly, and to\nseason society have tended to be considered incomplete by Pietistically-oriented churches\nand parachurch groups. This has had the effect of birthing the modern missionary movement.\nThe role of Halle in initiating this movement, (not to mention the work of the Methodists)\nshould not be underrated. </big></p>\n\n<p><big>Finally, there are several likely points of contact between secular intellectual\nhistory in Europe and Pietism, all of which lie outside the scope of this paper.</big></p>\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Philip Jacob Spener's Contribution to the Protestant Doctrine of the Church VI","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/essays/spen6f.htm"}

And my God shall supply \n    all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.\" Philippians \n    4:11-14, 19 </b></p>\n  <p>The president of the American \n    Red Cross, Elizabeth Dole, said in a letter to a Christian that, &#x93;Life is \n    a privilege, a responsibility and a stewardship to be met according to His \n    calling.&#x94; Stewardship of life implies that every aspect of our lives should \n    reflect our relationship with God. One area that people struggle with frequently \n    is that of finances. Everything we have is on loan from God&#x97;including the \n    money God allows us to earn at work. </p>\n  <p>Looking at Paul&#x92;s letter \n    to the Philippians (above) it is clear that he knew how to handle his finances. \n    He was able to get by during times of prosperity and during times of poverty. \n    For Paul, having money (or not having money) was never an issue of concern. \n    Can any of us make the same claim? </p>\n  <p>When evaluating your own \n    finances, whether as an individual or a family, remember to prayerfully consider \n    your situation. This workbook has been designed to help you evaluate your \n    current financial situation and provide you with the biblical perspective \n    on finances.<br>\n     <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/gift/gift_wkbkintro.htm#top\"><i>Top</i></a> \n  </p>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/gift/gift_wkbkteaching.htm\">&lt;Back</a> \n    <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/gift/gift_wkbkneeds.htm\">Next &gt;</a> </p></td>\n    <td width=\"9\" height=\"98\" valign=\"top\"></td>\n    </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"GIFT Ministry","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/gift/gift_wkbkintro.htm"}

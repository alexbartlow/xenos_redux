We interchange needs and desires \n    with one another so frequently that we confuse one for the other. <br>\n    &#x93;What is a need?&#x94; <br>\n    &#x93;What are desires?&#x94; <br>\n    &#x93;Is wanting something necessarily bad?&#x94; </p>\n  <p>Children must rely on \n    their parents for guidance in this area. As parents we know that our son or \n    daughter doesn&#x92;t need tennis shoes that cost $95. With their begging, whining, \n    and complaining our children would have us believe that they&#x92;re going to die \n    if their need for a home video game system isn&#x92;t met by our willing wallets. \n    Parents face the constant challenge of helping their children understand the \n    difference between needs and wants. </p>\n  <p>The same is certainly \n    true of us. We are God&#x92;s children; He ultimately knows, better than anyone, \n    what we need. </p>\n  <p>What does the Bible say \n    about our needs?<br>\n    <b>\" </b><b>And \n    my God shall supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ \n    Jesus.\" Philippians 4:19 </b></p>\n  <p>Clearly, our needs will \n    ultimately be satisfied by God. Look, for example, at the first couple of \n    lines of Psalms 23: <br>\n    <b>\" The Lord \n    is my shepherd, I shall not want.\" Psalm 23:1 </b></p>\n  <p>This famous passage goes \n    on to illustrate the various ways God meets the real needs of our life. </p>\n  <p>As Christians, we often \n    adopt the mind-set that things we desire but do not need must be wrong or \n    even sinful. God does want us to enjoy our role as a steward and often sacrifice \n    and suffering are a part of this enjoyment. For the steward, it is exciting \n    to see and experience how God will meet our challenging and changing needs. \n    This is not the normal area of struggle for most of us. In America, where \n    most of us have a higher annual income than two thirds of the rest of the \n    world, we struggle with materialism and greed.

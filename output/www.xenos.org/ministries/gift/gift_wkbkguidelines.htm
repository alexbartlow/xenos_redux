This is not a exhaustive \n    list of guidelines. Take the time to read the passages listed and do some \n    study on your own or with your spouse. </p>\n  <p>1. God owns everything. \n    We are stewards of His resources. <br>\n    <b>Psalms 24:1, \n    Haggai 2:8 </b></p>\n  <p>2. God will provide for \n    all of our material needs. We should trust Him and be thankful for the provisions \n    He has given us. <br>\n    <b>Philippians \n    4:18-19, Matthew 6:25-34, Hebrews 13:5 </b></p>\n  <p>3. All economic activity \n    (working, giving, savings, debt, spending, etc. . .) has eternal consequences \n    and impacts our effectiveness in this life as well as the heavenly rewards \n    we will receive. <br>\n    <b>Luke 16:10-13 \n    </b></p>\n  <p>4. Our motives and attitudes \n    in the area of finances are very important. <br>\n    <b>Proverbs \n    16:2, Mark 12:41-44, 2 Corinthians 9:7 </b></p>\n  <p>5. Until the guidelines \n    1 through 4 are understood and acted upon, it will be difficult to implement \n    techniques and further instruction. </p>\n  <p>6. Because of the guidelines \n    expressed in 1-3 above, we can be generous and distribute our resources according \n    to God&#x92;s standards. God is then glorified and we are blessed. New Testament \n    giving indicates that Christians should be sacrificial and consistent. <br>\n    <b>2 Corinthians \n    8 &amp; 9, 1 Corinthians 16:1-2 </b></p>\n  <p>7. The generous person \n    will be rewarded and the stingy person will suffer the consequences. <br>\n    <b>2 Corinthians \n    9:6, Galatians 6:7, Proverbs 11:25; 21:13; 28:20, 27</b></p></td>\n    <td width=\"9\" height=\"87\" valign=\"top\"></td>\n    </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"GIFT Ministry","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/gift/gift_wkbkguidelines.htm"}

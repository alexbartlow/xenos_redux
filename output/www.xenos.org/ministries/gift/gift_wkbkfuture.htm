By following the budget you will \n    be able to achieve the goals you outlined earlier in the workbook. </p>\n  <p>But, what happens if your \n    situation changes? On the positive side, you could receive a large bonus or \n    an increase in your pay. You could also receive a one-time gift from a family \n    member or inherit a gift from a deceased friend or relative. How does a godly \n    steward plan ahead for such events as these? </p>\n  <p>You have four basic choices \n    when you receive an unexpected increase in wealth: </p>\n  <p>1.

There is a point where each family should be able to say . . . \n    I give regularly to the Lord&#x92;s work and I have enough on which to live.

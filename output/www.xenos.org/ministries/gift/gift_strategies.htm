Living beyond resources \n    set aside </p>\n  <p>1. The fear of outliving \n    resources is a powerful motivator </p>\n  <p>2. People with abundant \n    wealth are not immune to this fear </p>\n  <p>3. Includes catastrophic \n    illnesses and other emergencies </p>\n  <p><b>Questions that Need \n    to be Addressed in your Financial Decisions</b><br>\n    1. How much would a wise steward leave to their children vs. ministry causes? \n    </p>\n  <p>2. Should resources be \n    saved until death? </p>\n  <p>3. Have you explored ways \n    to benefit ministry and save significant tax dollars through planned giving? \n    </p>\n  <p><b>Charitable \n    Gift Strategies</b><br>\n    The following is a discussion of charitable gift strategies that everyone \n    can use no matter your net worth or level of income. These strategies are \n    only briefly explained and for further information, please contact the personal \n    finance ministry or your professional advisor. </p>\n  <p><b>Outright Gifts</b><br>\n    Gifts of our current resources that are liquid and available. Examples would \n    include checks, cash or other assets that are easily converted into cash (e.g. \n    vehicle) </p>\n  <p>The main benefit is that \n    15 to 39 percent of the fair market value of the gift is returned to the individual \n    through tax savings</p>\n  <p><b>Gifts of Appreciated \n    Property</b><br>\n    Gifts that are not cash or checks and would have a taxable consequence if \n    sold at a profit and can be converted to cash by the ministry. Examples would \n    include real estate, stocks and collectibles. </p>\n  <p>This is a great strategy \n    because the individual not only gets a charitable contribution but also avoids \n    capital gains on the sale of the asset.</p>\n  <p><b>Naming a Ministry a \n    Beneficiary</b><br>\n    The best strategy is to name a ministry as a beneficiary for your retirement \n    plans, including IRAs and 401k plans. This is because these disbursements \n    will be taxable to the beneficiaries when they receive these funds. In addition \n    these funds are taxable for estate tax purposes. It is possible that 80 percent \n    of these funds could be taxed. A great strategy is to make provision for your \n    family through other sources (life insurance and non-retirement funds) and \n    gift IRAs, 401k plans to a ministry. </p>\n  <p>A ministry could also \n    benefit by being a beneficiary in a life insurance policy or your will. </p>\n  <p>Everyone should make a \n    calculation on how much wealth will be available for beneficiaries and ministry \n    at their death. Prayerfully consider what would be most beneficial for your \n    beneficiaries' spiritual growth and would facilitate investment in eternal \n    treasures.<i><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/gift/gift_strategies.htm#top\"> Top</a></i></p>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/gift/gift_giving.htm\">&lt;Back</a> \n    <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/gift/gift_strategies.htm\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n  </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"GIFT Ministry","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/gift/gift_strategies.htm"}

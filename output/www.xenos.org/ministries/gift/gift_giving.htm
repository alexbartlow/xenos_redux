God promises (indicatives) \n    and commands (imperatives) in the Bible are based on an eternal perspective. \n    Below are timetables of the temporal and eternal perspective of life. </p>\n  <p><b>Temporal Perspective<br>\n    <img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/gift_temporalchart.jpg\" width=\"504\"><br>\n    1 Corinthians 15:32 \n    - Let's eat and drink for tomorrow we die<br>\n    Luke 12 - Let's build barns to retire in comfort and worry<br>\n    James 5 - Sacrifice for something that won't last</b></p>\n  <p><b>Eternal Perspective<br>\n    <img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/gift_eternalview.gif\" width=\"510\"> <br>\n    James 4 - Life \n    on earth is brief<br>\n    Phillipians 3:20 - Citizenship is in heaven<br>\n    Revelations 21-22 - Our life in heaven </b></p>\n  <p>Many Christians have decided \n    to live on the first timeline out of ignorance, sin, or deception by either \n    improper teaching on God's perspective in finances or by Satan's influence. \n    </p>\n  <p>The temporal perspective \n    raises the importance of having material possessions and using them for selfish \n    purposes. </p>\n  <p>Switching the perspective \n    on life to the eternal perspective or \"living on the dot\" enables us not to \n    rely on material possessions for significance and security and not forfeit \n    eternal rewards. </p>\n  <p>God's imperatives are \n    always supported by the indicatives. He promises us an abundant life, to provide \n    for our needs and unimaginable blessings in the next life. </p>\n  <p>Where should you invest \n    your time and talents? The dot (the temporary world system) or eternity (God's \n    kingdom). </p>\n  <p>The returns that God promises \n    in his kingdom is unlimited and will never be lost to inflation, thieves, \n    illness or disasters (Matthew 6:24). </p>\n  <p>We have included some \n    strategies to assist you in making giving of God's resources more impactful \n    in this life and increasing your treasure in the next life.<i><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/gift/gift_giving.htm#top\">Top</a></i></p>\n  <p> <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/gift/gift_strategies.htm\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n  </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/gift_temporalchart.jpg","title":"GIFT Ministry","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/gift/gift_giving.htm"}

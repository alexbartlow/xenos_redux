When accumulation of money gives us a feeling of security or\n    pride, it is contrary to the biblical teaching in Matthew 6:19-21 and Philippians 4:19.\n    The Bible gives few commandments about saving money. It does, however, give us some\n    principles and guidelines for saving. Examining the verses mentioned above in Matthew and\n    Philippians alone might cause you to feel that saving money is not necessary. After all,\n    won&#x92;t God provide for our every need? Indeed he will, but there is a level of\n    responsibility and wisdom in a savings plan. Proverbs 21:20 and Proverbs 13:11 suggest the\n    wisdom of a savings plan for every family budget.<p>How do we implement the purposeful saving of\n    funds in our daily lives and personal budgets? </p>\n    <p>First, there must be a commitment to\n    spend less than you earn and stop all deficit spending. You will never have enough money\n    unless you can currently live on what you earn. A dollar spent is gone forever&#x97;it can\n    never be used in the future. Saving and giving are the only non-consumptive uses of money.\n    Second, it is important to realize that our true significance, sense of self-worth, and\n    fulfillment in life is the result of our relationship with God. Never try to buy what only\n    God can give you. </p>\n    <p><b>Debt </b><br>\n    &#x93;The borrower becomes the lenders slave.&#x94; This is not a new slogan, but rather\n    Scripture written over 2,500 years ago by Solomon (Proverbs 22:7). The enslavement to debt\n    is one of the biggest obstacles to financial freedom. The Bible does not specifically\n    prohibit the use of credit, but warns us of its dangers including: </p>\n    <p>1) It often presumes future income\n    to fund today&#x92;s lifestyle. Scripture warns us against presumptuous living (James\n    4:13-16). </p>\n    <p>2) It can enable us to fund some of\n    our sin areas (e.g., greed, self-indulgence, impatience, fear, poor self-esteem, envy, or\n    discontentment. See 1 Timothy 6:6-10). </p>\n    <p>3) It is very deceptive&#x97;it is\n    very easy to get into, but very difficult to get out of. </p>\n    <p>4) There are consequences within the\n    world system (kosmos) and our Christian walk when we are obligated to repay credit. </p>\n    <p>Many Christians use credit to meet perceived needs and block God&#x92;s demonstration of His\n    faithfulness to meet our real needs. Who better to meet our\n    real needs than our Creator (Matthew 6:31-43,7:10). </p>\n    <p>Most people have to use debt\n    financing to pay for a house or to pay their way through college; we believe that these\n    expenditures do not violate being good stewards of God&#x92;s\n    resources. Think carefully about your decisions to borrow money and evaluate your options\n    in light of the Bible. </p>\n    <p>Don&#x92;t let excessive debt ruin\n    the freedom God wants you to experience in the financial area. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/gift/gift_wkbkteaching.htm#top\"><i>Top</i></a></p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/gift/gift_wkbkintro.htm\">Next\n    &gt;</a></p></td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"GIFT Ministry","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/gift/gift_wkbkteaching.htm"}

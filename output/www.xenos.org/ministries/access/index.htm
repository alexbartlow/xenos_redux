The Young Adult Home Church is a gathering of high school students and older. They use a variety of ways to study and teach the Bible, and grow in their relationship with Christ and each other. The group meets at Xenos Office Building at 1340 Community Park Drive, on the first and third Saturday each month from 5:30 p.m.-7:30 p.m. </p>\n\n<p>Shannon Bennett<a href=\"mailto:accessministry@xenos.org\"><br>\nshbennett@columbus.rr.com</a><br>\n(614) 899-1916</p><br>\n\n<h3>\n<a name=\"oasis_access\" id=\"oasis_access\"></a>Oasis ACCESS Program<img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/access/graphics/access_class.jpg\" width=\"290\" hspace=\"5\"></h3>\n<p>The Oasis ACCESS mission is to create and provide an environment where all children can learn about, experience, respond to, and grow in the truth and love of Jesus Christ. The Oasis ACCESS Program is designed to supplement that goal by providing individualized support to those children who need it. There are two facets to this program:</p>\n<h4>Oasis Classroom Support</h4>\n<p>This program provides classroom support to children who need additional assistance in the Oasis classroom. All Access workers are certified through the same screening process as other Oasis workers, and have expressed an interest in working in a classroom supporting a child with special needs. Workers may be adult or student volunteers, who commit to providing support either weekly or every other week for one year. In addition to helping a child learn about God&#x2019;s plan through the Oasis curriculum and classroom activities, workers facilitate positive interactions with the child&#x2019;s Oasis classmates.</p>\n<h4>The HUB Classroom</h4>\n<p>The HUB allows Oasis ACCESS directors a quiet place to get to know a child, while obtaining classroom support and a classroom that best fits the child&#x2019;s needs. While our goal is to include all children in the Oasis experience, we recognize that some parents may desire to have a less stimulating environment for their child. The HUB is staffed with screened volunteers who have expressed an interest in serving children beyond the traditional Oasis classroom. The HUB offers a variety of adaptive toys and games, as well as music and Bible stories.</p>\n\n<p>Adrienne Luke<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:accessministry@xenos.org\">luke.adrienneh@gmail.com </a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"asl\" id=\"asl\"></a>American Sign Language (ASL)</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/access/graphics/sign_interpreting.JPG\" width=\"290\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\">The Interpreting Team ministry provides quality ASL services to deaf patrons, who attend various meetings and events held weekly at Xenos Christian Fellowship.</p>\n\n<p>Stephanie McHenry<br>\n</p>\n<p> <a href=\"mailto:accessministry@xenos.org\">mchenry.steph@gmail.com</a> </p>\n<p>(614) 570-7680 </p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p><strong>For general questions contact Greg Roth<br> \n<a href=\"mailto:accessministry@xenos.org\">tk0dtbj@yahoo.com</a><br>\n(614)313-0989</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n</div> \n      \n    </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/access/graphics/access_logo.jpg","title":"","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/access/index.htm"}

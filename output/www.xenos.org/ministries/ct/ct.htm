But we also \n  believe that a large meeting can uniquely accomplish certain elements of body \n  life. Strong, culturally relevant Bible teachings are the focal point of these \n  larger meetings which we call, Central Teachings (CTs). This provides a setting \n  in which a couple of thousand adults will hear God's word through highly gifted \n  and trained teachers. Dozens of home groups come together, often bringing their \n  friends and family who want their questions about Christianity answered.</p>\n\n\n<h3>What Do We Do There?</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/denaudsml.jpg\" width=\"386\">Our \n  <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/site.htm\">facility</a> helps to set an informal, non-traditional \n  atmosphere in which Christians and non-Christians alike can relax&#x97;feeling \n  free to bring coffee, pop and snacks into the auditorium to hear what God might \n  want to say to them through his word. The meeting starts with prayer and music, \n  followed by an <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ct_outln/index.htm\">expository Bible teaching</a>, \n  (this link takes you to dozens of teaching outlines) which is usually 40-50 \n  minutes long. After the teaching, people have the opportunity to ask questions \n  of the teacher through microphones, or wait until the meeting concludes to privately \n  talk with the teacher or one of the teaching team members. If you'd like a set \n  of tapes from these meetings, our <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/teachings/index.htm\">RealMedia \n  videos</a> will interest you!</p>\n<p>Three of our elders are the regular Central Teaching teachers. Lead Pastors \n  <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/personal/den.htm\">Dennis McCallum</a> and <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/personal/gary.htm\">Gary \n  DeLashmutt</a>, and Adult Education Director <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/personal/jim.htm\">Jim \n  Leffel</a>, rotate quarterly through different Bible teaching series.</p>\n\n<p>These are not worship services as you might typically think of them. Xenos \n  takes a somewhat unusual but biblical view of what <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/aboutxenos/strange.htm#worship\">worship \n  is in the New Testament</a>. Our music ranges from Christian music to secular \n  rock, blues or jazz. Each of the meetings are sensational for helping non-Christians \n  come to a relationship with Jesus Christ, grounding new believers and challenging \n  more mature believers. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>More Info</h3>\n\n<p>More information is available about our location and weekend Central Teaching \n  meeting times at our <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/aboutxenos/meetings.htm\">Main Campus</a>. The \n  Thursday p.m. CT meets on the <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/college/index.htm\">Ohio State University \n  campus</a>. People typically attend just one of these meetings. </p>\n\n\n<h3>Other Task Teams</h3>\n\n<p>Several other ministries have been organized to help with the different parts of these\nmeetings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to Xenos Home Page</a> <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/evang.htm\">Return to Evangelism Page</a> </p>\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/denaudsml.jpg","title":"Central Teachings","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/ct/ct.htm"}

Patterns of sinful \n        behaviors, conflict, defensiveness, and self-protection developed in the \n      past can affect how we relate in the present. </p>\n      <p>People really want to change, and often don't know how. Pastoral counselors \n        meet with people to talk about the problems in their lives and give biblical, relational solutions. Spiritual and emotional maturity is a process \n        which involves learning how to understand and forgive the past, expressing \n        gratitude for the love and concern received (even though many times deficient), \n      as well as deciding to sacrificially love others.</p>\n      <p>For Clinical Counseling, we often refer to Amy Moreno: amymccallummoreno@gmail.com</p>\n      <p>The <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/counseling/staff.htm\">Xenos Counseling Staff</a> consists of six pastoral \n      counselors: Katey Downs, Bev DeLashmutt, Lee Campbell, Connie Rue, Bryan Jones, and Nick Hetrick.</p>\n      <h3><b>Appointments</b></h3>\n      <p>Appointments can be made by telephone.</p>\n      <p>Katey: (614) 823-6510 x1128<br>\n        Bev: &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;(614) 823-6510 \n      x1138<br>\n      Connie: (614) 823-6510 x1703<br>\n        Lee: &#xA0;&#xA0; (614) 823-6510 x1134<br>\n        Bryan: (614) 823-6510 x1704<br>\n      Nick: (614) 823-6510 x1705</p>\n      <h3><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/counseling/teams.htm\">Counseling Ministry Teams</a></h3>\n      <p>Xenos has ministry teams designed to assist others that struggle with \n        specific issues, such as divorce, substance abuse, codependency, abortion and sexual \n      integrity.</p>\n      \n     \n      \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    </td>\n    </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Pastoral Counseling at Xenos","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/counseling/introduction.htm"}

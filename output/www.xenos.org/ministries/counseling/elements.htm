What caused the emotional disturbance? As the person\n        shares  the issue(s), listen for the facts, feelings, demands, wants,\n        and beliefs \n        as indicated by the &#x201C;I think, I believe, I need&#x2026;&#x201D; type\n         of statements. Be sure you understand the issue(s).      </p>\n      <h3>Sinful Reaction</h3>\n      <p>This is our flesh (Galatians 5:19ff) being revealed. Paul calls it the \n        &#x201C;former manner of life&#x201D; (Ephesians 4:22). How we react is\n        how  we have learned to control and manage our lives, in order to self\n        protect \n        and to get what we want. What are the affects (emotionally, physically,\n         mentally, spiritually, and relationally) on ourselves, spouse, children,\n        \n        God, and others?</p>\n      <h3>Idol-Fear</h3>\n      <p>Our sinful behavior stem from motives of the heart. Our fears and idols\n         motivate our sinful behavior. We fear the loss of _____ or fear not\n        getting \n        _____ or are worried about_____. Common fears center on <b>failure</b>, \n        <b>rejection</b>, <b>change </b>or <b>exposure</b> (loss of control,\n        powerless,  anxious). For every fear, there is a corresponding idol or &#x201C;functional&#x201D; \n        god. A functional god is &#x201C;what or who actually controls your actions,\n         thoughts, emotions, attitudes, memories, and anticipation's. Note well:\n        \n        your &#x2018;functional god' (i.e., &#x201C;If I am a success in my career,\n         I will be happy.&#x201D; Therefore, if I lose my job, I am a failure\n         as a person.) in a particular situation often stands diametrically opposed\n         \n      to your &#x2018;professed God'&#x201D;. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/counseling/elements.htm#sdfootnote1sym\" name=\"sdfootnote1anc\" class=\"sdfootnoteanc\" id=\"sdfootnote1anc\"><sup>1</sup></a>      </p>\n      <p>Fears center on what we <b>don't</b> want. Idols center on what we <b>do</b> \n        want. It isn't just that we want it, we MUST have it. The desire becomes \n        a demand, something we can't live without. Common idols are <b>power/success</b> \n        (&#x201C;I must have influence and status; I must achieve; I must always \n        succeed; be the best; always win&#x201D;. Accomplishment or success equals \n        value or self worth) or to <b>belong/ acceptance</b> (&#x201C;I must be loved, \n        taken care of, belong, be noticed, be appreciated, given credit&#x201D;) \n        or <b>safety/comfort</b> (&#x201C;Life must be easy, no problems, always \n        fair, stable, no conflicts, hassle free, painless, no hardship, calm&#x201D;. \n        Peace<b> </b>at any price) and finally <b>controlled</b> (&#x201C;I need \n        sameness and order. I need to control others or situations.&#x201D;).      </p>\n      <p>There are numerous &#x201C;strategies&#x201D; we pursue to satisfy our idols \n        and fears. One person may become a &#x201C;man-pleaser&#x201D; to ensure they \n        will never be rejected where another person may seek sexual encounters \n        to &#x201C;feel&#x201D; loved.      </p>\n      <p>Also, we can have different idols at different times. However, an \n        idol is usually revealed during times of suffering, since fear of loss\n        of what we treasure and have faith in will be exposed.</p>\n      <p>We can summarize this discussion on idols and fears with the following \n        chart:      </p>\n      \n        <table width=\"591\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"7\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n          <col width=\"280\"> <col width=\"281\"> \n          <tr valign=\"top\"> \n            <td width=\"280\"> \n              <p><b>IDOL</b></p>\n            </td>\n            <td width=\"281\"> \n              <p><b>FEAR</b></p>\n            </td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr valign=\"top\"> \n            <td width=\"280\"> \n              <p><b>Power/Success</b> - Accomplishment equals personal worth</p>\n            </td>\n            <td width=\"281\"> \n              <p><b>Failure</b> - I'm a loser, worthless, incompetent, inadequate</p>\n            </td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr valign=\"top\"> \n            <td width=\"280\"> \n              <p><b>Love/acceptance</b> - Seeks to be loved.

It's our freewill choice.</p>\n      <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n      <p>In most cases, the Trust Triangle provides a systematic model in considering\n         the issue at hand. It provides a window into the person's heart where\n        \n        the external behaviors have their roots. By exposing the idols and fears\n         that have replaced God, the person has the opportunity for real change.\n        \n        Sanctification (real change) begins with repentance, which continues\n        with  the process of learning God's truth. Truth is then faithfully applied\n        \n        by loving others with complete dependency on God to empower us. Over\n        time,  the Holy Spirit performs the work of sanctification, working from\n        the \n        inside out. In turn, we experience walking by faith in the power of the\n         Holy Spirit, as we trust God when our faith is challenged.</p>\n      <h3>Footnote</h3>\n      \n      \n       \n      \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    </td>\n    </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Specific Elements of Trust Triangle","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/counseling/elements.htm"}

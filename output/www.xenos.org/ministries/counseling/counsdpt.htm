Xenos has struggled with questions raised by modern \n        therapeutic schools of thought.

These papers are a partial response to that need. \n        <br>\n      </p>\n      <p>DivorceCare ministry provides a five week class/support group for those \n        suffering the trauma of divorce. </p>\n      <p> <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/counseling/counsel.htm\">Lay Counseling</a> is a general orientation for \n        those interested in pursuing informal counseling in the context of home \n        group ministry. </p>\n      <p> <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/counseling/luvthpy.htm\">Love Therapy </a>is an approach to intervention \n        based on the centrality of Christian love, not only as the fruit of spiritual \n        growth, but also as a contributing factor in growth and healing. </p>\n      <p> <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/dotpsy.htm\">Postmodernism and Psychotherapy </a>is \n        an abstract of Dr. Jim Fidelibus' article detailing the influence of postmodernism \n        on psychotherapy today.

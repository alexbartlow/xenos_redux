Where do you begin? Good question! Biblical counseling \n        seeks to understand people and their lives from God's perspective. According \n        to Mark (7:20), all problems stem from the condition of the heart. Matthew \n        (6:21) states that what our heart loves, is what we will live for. Combining \n        these two passages, we can conclude that all behavior stems from a motive \n        of the heart. As counselors, we must discern the condition of heart and \n        the tool we use is the Trust Triangle.</p>\n      <p>Scripture teaches us that every human being is a sinner and that this\n        condition of sinfulness shapes the way we interpret and respond to every\n        circumstance of life. </p>\n      <p>The Bible also presents every human being as a\n          worshipper. We all worship\n          or love something or someone. Matthew 6:21 states that what rules the\n          heart, what the heart loves, will influence our thoughts, behaviors,\n          and\n          emotions, i.e., our lives. Paul Tripp summarizes these two points well:</p>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>&#x201C;The connection between these two aspects of the biblical paradigm&#x2014;sin \n          and worship&#x2014;explains the nature of the human struggle and our task \n          as counselors. Sin has corrupted and diverted worship. Paul says that \n          as sinners, we exchange the worship and service of the Creator for worship \n          and service of the created thing (Romans 1:25). The most significant \n          effect of our sin is not that we do wrong things but that we worship \n          the wrong thing. Wrongdoing is always the result of wrong worship. Sin \n          by its very nature is idolatrous. It is rooted in the creation taking \n          precedence over the Creator&#x2026; The war that is going on is not \n          just the war for healthy recovery from our experiences. The war is a \n          war of worship, a war for control of the heart. What controls the heart \n          will shape the way I deal with every experience of life, &#x2026; The \n          biblical counselor is called to help the sufferer examine the heart \n          that he or she has brought to the experience of suffering and how that \n          heart has shaped the way he/she has thought about and dealt with being \n          sinned against&#x2026;&#x201D; <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/counseling/trusttriangle.htm#sdfootnote1sym\" name=\"sdfootnote1anc\" class=\"sdfootnoteanc\" id=\"sdfootnote1anc\"><sup>1</sup></a></p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <h3>General Outline of Trust Triangle:</h3>\n      <h3><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/counseling/graphics/trusttriangle.png\" width=\"313\"></h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>PP&#x2014;The presenting problem being confronted<br>\n        </li>\n        <li>Sinful Reaction/affects&#x2014;Our sinful reaction(s) to the presenting \n          problem and the results<br>\n        </li>\n        <li>Idols&#x2014;The source of our sinful reactions</li>\n        <li>Fears&#x2014;What are we afraid of?<br>\n        </li>\n        <li>Crises of Faith&#x2014;When faced in the future with the presenting \n          problem will we, by faith, trust God or our idols.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Footnote</h3>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/counseling/trusttriangle.htm#sdfootnote1anc\" name=\"sdfootnote1sym\" class=\"sdfootnotesym\" id=\"sdfootnote1sym\">1</a> \n        <i>The Journal of Biblical Counseling</i>, Volume 15, Number 3, spring \n        1997, page 7</p>\n      \n      \n       \n      \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    </td>\n    </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Trust Triangle","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/counseling/trusttriangle.htm"}

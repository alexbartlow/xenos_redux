It promises him complete freedom \n          and liberty, but in reality abjectly enslaves him. It is always lying \n          in wait within man, so that at the right moment, he may yield his will \n          to it and become subject to it. It is clear from Matthew 5:28 and Mark \n          4:19, that Jesus considered lust as a sin with highly destructive powers.&#x201D;<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/counseling/idols.htm#sdfootnote1sym\" name=\"sdfootnote1anc\" class=\"sdfootnoteanc\" id=\"sdfootnote1anc\"><sup>1</sup></a></p>\n        <p>&#x201C;An idol is anything we put our trust in to protect us and provide \n          for our needs apart from God.

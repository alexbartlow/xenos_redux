C&amp;C was formed out of the conviction and burden that\n        adults today are becoming harder to engage in substantive conversation\n        and relationships.&#xA0;This might be due to busy lifestyles, material\n        pursuits that take priority over spiritual inquiry, or perhaps negative\n        experiences with the church or Christians in the past.&#xA0;</p>\n      <p>Yet, we know that these same adults gratefully accept God's message\n        when they get their questions answered and where they see Christians\n        living out community as God defines it in his word.&#xA0;They see God's\n        perspective of marriage and parenting relationships, work relationships,\n        and friendships and realize that they have always wanted these. Sometimes\n        though, the difficulty is helping them look past their barriers and honestly\n        investigate the truth claims of Christianity.&#xA0; </p>\n      <p>This is where C&amp;C fits in.&#xA0;What God depicts in his word is\n        Christians who respectfully listen to many views, though not necessarily\n        agreeing, who are hospitable and other-centered, and in general who are\n        able to have and host a great time! That certainly describes Jesus Christ's\n        presence at various parties narrated in scripture. This demeanor would\n        go a long way in distinguishing us from possible past negative experiences\n        with Christians who may have pounded God's message without dialoguing\n        respectfully about different views. The C&amp;C discussion is therefore\n        purposefully <b>NOT</b> oriented toward the Christian world view and\n        purposefully <b>most </b>interested in drawing out and listening to all\n        views.&#xA0;The facilitator has invested considerable time into preparing\n        for just such a discussion.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc2.htm\">Read on</a> if you\n        have more questions. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc2.htm\">&gt;&gt;</a></p>\n      <p>1.

This is a perfect opportunity for them to begin \n        to experience what it is like to be around people committed to God's love \n        and hopefully develop a more trusting friendship with the home group member \n        who invited them. This trust provides a context in which future discussions \n        about spiritual matters take place; our friend knows that although we \n        might disagree with their view, we are not judging them. And they are \n        more likely to be intellectually honest in their pursuit of <em>why</em> \n        we believe what we believe, therefore seeing that we are not “narrow-minded” \n        but actually have a substantial basis of evidence for believing what we \n        do. This might even strike them in contrast to their own beliefs \n        and their evidence for them. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc3.htm\">&gt;&gt;</a></p>\n      <p>1. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc1.htm\">What is Conversation &amp; Cuisine?</a><br>\n        2.

If the food was going to be exotic and unusual, this would \n        be intriguing; high quality standards are important. We stay away from \n        commonplace or simple menus for this reason. A discussion after dinner \n        on an interesting topic might add to the evening. Knowing the atmosphere \n        will be relaxed and that beer and wine are served would appeal to some \n        as well. A Conversation and Cuisine event normally involves a weekend-evening \n        dinner party where home group members invite their non-Christian friends \n        and family to socialize, dine and join in a discussion afterward. Naturally \n        there is no cost to the guest.</p>\n      <p>We arrange for a facilitator to present and lead a discussion on an interesting, \n        yet not highly controversial topic. Sometimes the facilitator is from \n        that home group, often not. Regardless, they have researched and are knowledgeable \n        about the topic. They will help keep the discussion moving forward, bring \n        to light facts that are interesting to everyone, and hopefully have helped \n        demonstrate that Christians can be respectful of all views.</p>\n      <p>One \"touch\" that helps set the evening apart is the written \n        invitation that is designed and used.&#xA0;This visually communicates \n        the evening is worth coming to, and describes the food and discussion \n        succinctly, yet attractively.&#xA0;<b>We should ALWAYS verbalize to our \n        guest as we invite them, that &#x93;our home Bible study hosts the event, \n        although the evening is not in the least a Bible study; all views are \n        welcomed.&#x94;&#xA0;</b>Not acknowledging the connection between the \n        C&amp;C and your home group would be a &#x93;bait &amp; switch.&#x94;&#xA0; \n      </p>\n      <p>Menus, facilitators and invitation designs are shared between the various \n        home groups who host C&amp;Cs. This significantly minimizes \"reinventing \n        the wheel\" and even more, adds to the quality and enjoyment of events \n        as we share ideas. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc4.htm\">&gt;&gt;</a></p>\n      <p>1. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc1.htm\">What is Conversation &amp; Cuisine?</a><br>\n        2. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc2.htm\">Why a dinner-discussion party?</a><br>\n        3.

The reason for the infrequent \n        schedule is to make it possible for parents to get a baby sitter without \n        feeling they are neglecting their children. Most adults will be willing \n        to get a baby sitter if the events are only once per quarter. Consequently, \n        we have the adults' full attention and their entire night available. (Contrast \n        this to evenings when guests bring their children and spend the whole \n        evening preoccupied with them.) </p>\n      <p>This ministry began in 1992 for the reasons described at the beginning \n        of this document. Churchwide, home groups are hosting 40-75 events \n        per year since then. It is fairly common to see a dozen guests or more \n        at an event and they typically are very appreciative of the hospitality \n        and openness during the discussion. It is not unusual to hear that their \n        exposure to Christians in this enjoyable, relaxed and non-threatening \n        environment enabled them, in the weeks and months following, to engage \n        their Christian friend in more spiritually oriented discussions and to \n        ask them questions.</p>\n      <p>Interested? <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/host_cc.htm\">Here's help</a> with hosting an event \n        and to take advantage of our materials. If you think of new topics \n        and/or menus, please <a href=\"mailto:cuisine@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=New%20C&amp;C%20topic\">share \n        them with us</a>. We'll be grateful. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/topics.htm\">&gt;&gt;</a></p>\n      <p><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=Conversation%20%26%20Cuisine\">Contact \n        Dennis with a comment or question</a> </p>\n      <p>1. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc1.htm\">What is Conversation &amp; Cuisine?</a><br>\n        2. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc2.htm\">Why a dinner-discussion party?</a><br>\n        3. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc3.htm\">What kind of dinner party would you like to go to \n        if invited?</a><br>\n        4.

Share them in our discussion if you wish. </p><ol><li><i>How have Americans' beliefs about the afterlife changed over the last twenty-five years?</i> What views have increased in popularity? What views have declined? How would you explain this change? </li> <li><i>Have your beliefs about the afterlife changed over the last several years?</i> If so, describe that change. What factors influenced this change? </li> <li><big><i>Do you think that all of the above views about the afterlife can be somehow be true at the same time?</i> Even if they contradict one another? </big></li> <li><i>Do our beliefs about the afterlife determine what afterlife we will experience?</i> For example, suppose I believe in reincarnation leading to nirvana, while you believe in a final judgment leading to heaven or hell. Will I be reincarnated and ultimately reach nirvana <i>because I believe in it</i>? Will you be judged to heaven or hell <i>because you believe in them</i>? </li> <li><i>On what basis should we decide what to believe about the afterlife?</i> What our family or closest friends believe? What appeals to us most? Intuitive hunches? What the majority in our society believes? What has the most evidence? Some other basis? </li> <li>If evidence is an important basis for your beliefs about the afterlife, <i>what kind of evidence carries the most weight for you</i>? Your own or others' personal experiences? Historical documentation of life after death? Religious leaders' authoritative declarations? How much evidence is enough to make a responsible choice to believe? </li> </ol><p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/topics.htm\">Return to the Topics page</a></p>      </body></div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Comparative Views of the Afterlife: Reaction Sheet","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc_resources/afterlife.htm"}

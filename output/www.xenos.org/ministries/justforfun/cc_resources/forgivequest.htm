For the victim of emotional abuse, the most viable form of help is\n    self-help--and a victim handicapped by the need to \"forgive\" the abuser is a\n    handicapped helper indeed.\" Andrew Vachss, \"You Carry the Cure in Your Own\n    Heart\" in <i>Parade Magazine</i>, Aug. 28, 1994. p.6 </big></li>\n  <li><big>Victims lose some percentage of capacity, \"and that capacity remains lost so\n    long as the victim is stuck in the cycle of 'understanding' and 'forgiveness.' The abuser\n    has no right to forgiveness--such blessings can only be earned. And although the damage\n    was done with words, true forgiveness can only be earned with deeds.\" ibid. p.6 </big></li>\n  <li><big>Love cannot last long or live out its eternal purpose in human relationships\n    without a foundation of forgiveness\" Dan Allender, <i>Bold Love</i> p. 41 </big></li>\n  <li><big>\"I will not live with purpose and joy unless I love. I will not be able to\n    love unless I forgive and I will not forgive unless my hatred is continually melted by the\n    searing truth and grace of the gospel.\" Allender, p.31 </big></li>\n  <li><big>\"The more I thought about it, the more I realized that this absolution\n    [forgiveness] was really another form of denial: \"If I forgive you, we can pretend\n    that what happened wasn't so terrible.\" I came to realize that this aspect of\n    forgiveness was actually preventing a lot of people from getting on with their\n    lives.\" Susan Forward, <i>Toxic Parents</i> (NY: Bantam, 1989) p. 189 </big></li>\n  <li><big>\"Responsibility can go only one of two places: outward, onto the people who\n    have hurt you, or inward, into yourself. So you may forgive your <i>parents</i> but end up\n    hating <i>yourself</i> all the more in exchange.\" <i>Toxic Parents</i> p. 189. </big></li>\n  <li><big>Clients all too often discovered that the empty promise of forgiveness had merely\n    set them up for bitter disappointment. Some of them experienced a rush of well-being, but\n    it didn't last because nothing had really changed in the way they felt or in their family\n    interactions. <i>Toxic Parents</i> p. 189. </big></li>\n  <li><big>Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ\n    God forgave you.

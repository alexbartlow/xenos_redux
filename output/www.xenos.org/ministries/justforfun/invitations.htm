These include tasteful lay out, attractive wording, \n        correct spelling and all special features. Below is a sample invitation. \n      </p>\n      <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/invite_front.gif\" width=\"250\" alt=\"C&amp;C inviation\"> \n        <img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/invite_back.gif\" width=\"250\" alt=\"Men &amp; Women invitation\"></p>\n      <h3>The special features seen on this invitation are: </h3>\n      <p><strong>Map: </strong>Unless your venue is very well known, a map should \n        be included on the back or second page. </p>\n      <p><strong>RSVP:</strong> This is typical for an event that so obviously \n        requires planning ahead of time.&#xA0;It will allow appropriate amounts \n        of food to be purchased and prepared, and helps us all remember we've \n        committed to that evening. </p>\n      <p><strong>&#x93;No Baby-sitting provided&#x94; notice: </strong>When parents \n        have their children in the home, their attention is partially distracted. \n        Children typically disrupt particularly the discussion portion of the \n        evening. Without distractions or the hassle of packing the kids up, parents \n        will have a more relaxed and pleasant evening. They will tend to enter \n        into conversation with more attentiveness. </p>\n      <p><strong>Beverage notices: </strong>According to the Bible, drinking is \n        not a sin, as long as it is moderate. For many groups, appropriate serving \n        of beer and wine is a good idea. The group leaders should make the decision \n        whether to serve alcohol. If you decide your group will serve alcohol, \n        provide only small quantities of beer and/or wine, and be sure to have \n        nonalcoholic beverages available as well. This ensures guests will not \n        feel they have to move outside their normal social environment during \n        the event. The presence of beer and wine says, \"We are normal people \n        who can relax and have some fun.\" Notice that we do not want our \n        guests (not to mention our members) intoxicated. They will not be able \n        to participate appropriately in the discussion if they are drunk. Don't \n        overplay the alcohol. </p>\n      <p><strong>Discussion options: </strong>The invitation should make it clear \n        that people may either participate in the discussion, simply watch others \n        discuss or may leave if they desire. It should also indicate all views \n        are welcome. People have fears about talking over issues with Christians, \n        and this explicit statement of freedom will disarm some of those fears. \n      </p>\n      <p><strong>Title of discussion: </strong>Every facilitator will develop \n        a title for his or her discussion in coordination with the team leadership. \n        These should focus on issues of interest to modern secular people. </p>\n      <p><strong>Menu: </strong>The invitations should prominently feature the \n        menu, described in language that is fun and intriguing. The central leadership \n        can help with expertise on wording and lay out of the invitations. </p>\n      <p><strong>Paper: </strong>Try to print the invitations on quality paper. \n        The impression should be of a classy dinner--not a wiener roast or church \n        potluck. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/dayofevent.htm\">&gt;&gt;</a></p>\n      <p>1 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/host_cc.htm\">Hosting an Event</a><br>\n        2 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/mobilizehg.htm\">Mobilizing your Home Group</a><br>\n        3 Invitations<br>\n        4 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/dayofevent.htm\">Day of Event</a></p>\n       \n      \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    </td>\n    <td valign=\"top\">\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/index.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/eim_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Just for Fun\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n       \n      <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/cc_pic.jpg\" width=\"120\"></p>\n      \n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc1.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/cnc_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Conversation &amp; Cuisine\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/playgroups.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/playgroup_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Playgroups\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/gametime.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/gametime_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to GameTime\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/evang.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/comrel_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Community Relations\" border=\"0\"></a> \n      </p>\n    </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/cc_pic.jpg","title":"Invitations","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/invitations.htm"}

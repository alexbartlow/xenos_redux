We \n        want to not only avoid illness, but also extend our lifespan. But it seems \n        that modern medicine can not always get the job done for us. As a result, \n        interest and research into alternative forms of medicine, both physical \n        and spiritual are growing daily.</p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc_resources/AltMedicine.pdf\">Handout in PDF format. </a></p>\n      <h3><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc_resources/animal.htm\">Animal Rights and Human Responsibility</a></h3>\n      <p> Do animals have rights? If so, what are they? If not, why not? \n        The animal rights movement is radical and according to many, extreme. \n        The movement raises fascinating questions about cruelty, the nature of \n        life, and whether humans should be viewed as any different than other \n        species. If so, why?</p>\n      <h3>Art and Beauty</h3>\n      <p>Art is arguably one of the best ways to understand \n        what is happening in the culture. The capacity to appreciate beauty is \n        transcendent and yet \"tastes\" are relative and very personal. \n        Our attitudes and values about beauty often correspond to our views about \n        the nature of truth. What is it that drives humans to create, yet not \n        the animals?</p>\n      <h3> Challenges Facing America&#x92;s Youth</h3>\n      <p> The last ten years have seen alarming trends amongst \n        America&#x92;s youth. Many experts agree that addressing growing levels \n        of violence and despair among our teenage population should be our highest \n        priority. However, the difficulty consists in developing consensus as \n        to the sources and solutions to these complicated issues.</p>\n      <h3> &#xA0;Cloning</h3>\n      <p>Now that sheep have been cloned, will humans be next? What are the ethical \n        and legal implications of our ability to clone?</p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc_resources/Cloning.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Handout in PDF format. </a></p>\n      <h3> Commitment and Relationships</h3>\n      <p>Recent studies show that a lifelong committed relationship is considered \n        a top priority by an overwhelming number of people living in Western culture. \n        And yet, most of those surveyed are very pessimistic about maintaining \n        their own relationships due to the perceived constraints placed on the \n        individual by those same commitments. Is the obvious need for commitment \n        incompatible with the value we place on individualism in our culture? \n        Guest facilitator, Tim Lipovsky, will lead us in this thought provoking \n        discussion.</p>\n      <h3><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc_resources/well.htm\">Dying to be Well</a></h3>\n      <p>What is health anyway? When is enough, enough? Is wellness a purely physiological \n        processs?  We&#x92;ll survey some modern and ancient views \n        on these and related questions.</p>\n      <h3>Evolution and Biblical Christianity</h3>\n      <p>Though reportedly in direct opposition, could it be possible that they \n        are both true? Or is biblical Christianity even believable in light of \n        the scientific evidence that has been found? What if these two do contradict \n        each other? What would the implication be to my life? Or does any of it \n        matter?</p>\n      <h3>Fatherhood in the New Millenium</h3>\n      <p> We will explore \n        such questions as: Why has so much public and political attenion been \n        given to fatherhood? What does it mean to be a dad in a rapidly changing \n        culture?</p>\n      <h3><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc_resources/forgivereac.htm\">Forgiveness in the Age of Rage</a></h3>\n      <p>One authority says, \"A particularly pernicious myth is that &#x91;healing \n        requires forgiveness&#x92; of the abuser. Victims lose some percentage \n        of capacity and that capacity remains lost so long as the victim is stuck \n        in the cycle of &#x91;understanding and forgiveness&#x92;.\" Another \n        says, \"I will not live with purpose and joy unless I love. I will \n        not be able to love unless I forgive.\" Which of these is right? </p>\n      <h3>Forgiveness in Relationships</h3>\n      <p> Why should I forgive? Isn&#x92;t that a \n        sign of weakness? Won&#x92;t it leave me open to be victimized again? \n        I wish I could \"let things go\" but I can't.&#xA0; Should \n        we only forgive when the person wants us to forgive them or would it be \n        better to forgive unconditionally?</p>\n      <h3>Guilt &amp; Shame</h3>\n      <p>Why do I feel guilty? Why do I think something is wrong with me? Are \n        these feelings good or harmful? What should I do about them? We will survey \n        some modern and ancient views on these and related questions.</p>\n      <h3>In the Eye of the Beholder (Art &amp; Beauty)</h3>\n      <p>Have society&#x92;s ideas about beauty changed? \n        Does art imitate life or does life imitate art? Where do we draw the line \n        between art and obscenity? How do we determine what is beautiful? And \n        why do humans have the capacity to appreciate beauty?</p>\n      <h3> Internet and Relationships</h3>\n      <p>How is the Internet affecting our culture and the way we form relationships?</p>\n      <p>Do you use voice mail or e-mail to avoid people? Is the Internet the \n        place to find a date? Are we closer as members of society or or are we \n        drifting farther apart as a result of the Internet?</p>\n      <h3> &#xA0;Jack Kevorkian: Man of Mercy or Doctor \n        of Death?</h3>\n      <p>More and more people seem to view assitance \n        in suicide or active euthanasia as a legitimate way to deal with pain, \n        suffering or terminal illness. Why are more people coming to this conclusion? \n        Many view assisted suicide as an act of mercy. Why do others disagree? \n        What would be the possible implications of making it legal for physicians \n        (or others) to directly cause people&#x92;s death? When terminally ill \n        people request help in suicide, is death really what they need? Is this \n        desire to die significantly different from a rejected lover&#x92;s desire \n        to die or from suicide due to depression? If so, why is it different? \n        Rather than legalizing assisted suicide, are there other things the health \n        care system could change to address the perceived need for assisted suicide?</p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc_resources/Kevorkian.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Handout in PDF format</a> </p>\n      <h3>Love</h3>\n      <p>What is love, and how can we keep ourselves in it? Is it a fleeting feeling, \n        or can it be sustained? Why can&#x92;t we have satisfying, lasting love \n        relationships? Enjoy a thought-provoking discussion on the different \n        views of love from anthropologists, psychiatrist and scientists. </p>\n      <h3>Men and Women</h3>\n      <p>What is gender? Are there differences between men and women that go beyond \n        the physical? Is it possible to generalize at all? Should we focus only \n        on sameness between sexes, or is there value in recognizing difference? Enjoy this discussion, including samples of leading opinions in this controversial \n        field.</p>\n      <h3> Money</h3>\n      <p>Why do we love it so much? Join us in a discussion of the widespread \n        materialism of our American culture as we question the emphasis and value \n        we place on financial security and comfort.</p>\n      <h3> Multiculturalism</h3>\n      <p>Multiculturalism is a movement designed to facilitate awareness and appreciation \n        of diverse cultures. In some circles, it teaches that all cultures should \n        be empowered to preserve, unchanged, their unique cultural reality. What \n        impact has Multiculturalism had on society so far? What other areas of \n        society have been effected? Where is the movement headed?</p>\n      <h3> <strong>Parenting: Does it Really Matter?</strong></h3>\n      <p>Why do kids turn out the way they do? How much of it is parenting? How \n        have our parents affected us? This issue impacts all of us, parents and \n        non-parents alike, so come and discuss the diverse and contradictory views \n        on this question: \"Do parents matter?\"</p>\n      <h3>Self Esteem</h3>\n      <p>We all need it &#x97; but where do we get it? Do we determine our own \n        self-esteem, or is it determined for us? Does our self-esteem determine \n        our performance, or does our performance determine our self-esteem? Discover how to translate \n        these and other questions into real-life tools we can use to help maintain \n        a healthy self-image.</p>\n      <h3> Simplify Your Life</h3>\n      <p> <b> </b>Stressed out?! We&#x92;ll look at what \n        social scientists, popular authors, and the Bible have to say about managing \n        our hectic schedules, reducing clutter and living with more meaning, depth, \n        and purpose. Does your life need to be simplified? Take this short quiz. \n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li> I&#x92;m too busy right now to take this quiz. T/F</li>\n        <li>My house is overflowing with things I don&#x92;t need and can&#x92;t \n          keep track of. T/F</li>\n        <li>My to-do list is longer than one page. T/F</li>\n        <li>I can&#x92;t find my to-do list! T/F</li>\n        <li>I schedule appointments with myself. T/F</li>\n        <li>I never spend enough time on what matters most. T/F</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>If you answered TRUE to three or more of these, \n        WATCH OUT your gonna blow a gasket!!&#xA0;</p>\n      <h3>Sports: A Window Onto American Values</h3>\n      <p>The esteem we place on professional athletes, \n        the amount of time and money we spend as spectators and fans, to the increased \n        involvement in youth athletics reflect our love for sports. But have we \n        gone too far? Has the value of sports become an obsession? When does competitiveness \n        become ruthlessness? When does committment become obsession? When does \n        \"doing your best\" become \"win at all costs\"? </p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc_resources/SportsandSociety-Handout.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Handout in PDF format. </a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc_resources/SportsandSociety-Notes.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Facilitator notes in PDF format. </a></p>\n      <h3>The Blame Game</h3>\n      <p>Have we become a nation of victims? Is anyone ever responsible for anything? \n        How much of my future is determined by my past? As legislation ratifies \n        more and more rights, must there be more and more violations? Should we \n        try or is it even possible to control \"rights inflation?\" Join \n        us as we discuss what one noted sociologist has called \"the most \n        pervasive trend in the last three decades.\"</p>\n      <h3> The Impact \n        of Computer Technology on Today&#x92;s Culture</h3>\n      <p>Without exception, technology affects each and \n        every one of us. Experts point out that the impact of computer technology \n        on our culture has surpassed that of the industrial revolution. We&#x92;ll \n        explore the social implications of technology on community and personal \n        relationships and, more importantly, our views as individuals.</p>\n      <h3>The Problem of Evil</h3>\n      <p>We will address such questions as \"How can there be a loving God \n        when we see such horrific displays of evil around us?\" \"Is there \n        really such a thing as evil?\" As we discuss these questions we will \n        also look at how different world-views address these questions.</p>\n      <h3><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc_resources/judge.htm\">To Judge or not to judge</a></h3>\n      <p>People who are judgmental can be annoying. Tolerance is an important \n        feature of any free society. Who am I to say another&#x92;s personal faith \n        is wrong or that other&#x92;s tastes in fashion are somehow inferior? \n        Yet, most of us would condemn groups like the KKK without hesitation. \n        Also, when we face a city and country racked by rampant crime we often \n        hear the call for stricter law enforcement and longer sentences. Why do \n        we instinctively know that judgments are right in some cases, but not \n        in others? </p>\n      <h3> Today&#x92;s Values</h3>\n      <p> Where will they take us? What are values? How do our values impact our \n        day to day decisions? What values are currently driving our culture? How \n        might those values effect our future? Were the &#x91;good old days&#x92; \n        values all that good? Are there universal values that would work well \n        for all of us?</p>\n      <h3> <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc_resources/afterlife.htm\">Views of the AfterLife</a></h3>\n      <p>Does life continue after death? How do different cultures and people \n        view this interesting subject?</p>\n      <h3>What do you want from Your Doctor?</h3>\n      <p>What is our doctor&#x92;s role in making decisions about our lives and \n        health? What do we expect from our doctors? Can (and should) they fulfill \n        these expectations?</p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc_resources/Want-from-doctor.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Handout in PDF format. </a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc_resources/Want-from-doctor-Notes.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Facilitator notes in PDF format. </a></p>\n      <h3>Why evil?</h3>\n      <p>We will explore such questions as: why is there evil in the world? How \n        do you deal with evil? Come and share your views as we attempt to understand \n        evil in the world today from various perspectives.</p>\n      <h3>Workplace Ethics</h3>\n      <p>What determines what is ethical in the workplace? How can we resolve\n         different-views of what is ethical? Come and share your views  about\n        this current and controversial topic.</p>\n      \n      <p>While some controversy is fine, subjects should generally <b>avoid extremely \n        controversial topics, </b>such as abortion or politics. Such issues often \n        have no middle ground on which agreement, friendship or understanding \n        can be based. Therefore, these topics are poor pre-evangelistic topics.      </p>\n      <p>The discussion is <b>not</b> intended to preach the Gospel. Neither is \n        there an effort to \"win\" a debate. The main point is to be interested \n        in understanding other people's views, respectfully sharing our own, and \n        to enjoy getting to know one another. </p>\n      <p>Facilitators of successful discussions should send in information on \n        their topic to the C&amp;C administrator at the office, so other groups \n        can take advantage. Facilitators often visit other groups and offer their \n        discussion there. Please offer a $50-stipend to visiting facilitators \n        to compensate them for giving up an evening to enhance ours.<b><small><br>\n        </small></b></p>\n      <p>1. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc1.htm\">What is Conversation &amp; Cuisine?</a><br>\n2. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc2.htm\">Why a dinner-discussion party?</a><br>\n3. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc3.htm\">What kind of dinner party would you like to go to if invited?</a><br>\n4. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc4.htm\">How often does a home group host a Conversation &amp; Cuisine?</a><br>\n5.

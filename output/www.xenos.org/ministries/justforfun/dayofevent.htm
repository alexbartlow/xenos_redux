Everyone should \n          have one, even the home group members who might know most of the people. \n        </li><li><b>Introducing the dinner: </b>The team leader or cooking leader should \n          assemble people and explain the dinner. Some interesting facts about \n          the menu may be shared, especially if it is international. The method \n          for serving and eating should be explained. Some meals are eaten standing \n          up. Otherwise, seating arrangements should be explained. </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Introducing the Discussion</h3>\n      <p>After dinner, the people are assembled for the discussion. Discussions \n        should be held in a room with generally circular seating. Straight rows \n        are too formal! The facilitator or host should give the introduction to \n        the discussion, covering the following points: \n      </p><ul>\n        <li> The group sponsoring the event is Christian. \n        </li><li> They put these events on several times a year as an opportunity to \n          share ideas with friends outside the group. \n        </li><li> <b>But</b> this meeting is not a church meeting, where people are \n          all supposed to believe a certain thing. Different views are welcome, \n          and disagreement will make the discussion more interesting. \n        </li><li> No one can assume anyone else at the meeting believes a certain way. \n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Handouts </h3>\n      <p>Most facilitators will have a <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/reaction.htm\">handout reaction \n        sheet</a>. These sheets start everyone thinking about the subject, and \n        usually provoke more discussion. The questions take no expertise to answer, \n        and are based on opinion or experience.</p>\n      <p>1 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/host_cc.htm\">Hosting an Event</a><br>\n        2 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/mobilizehg.htm\">Mobilizing your Home Group</a><br>\n        3 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/invitations.htm\">Invitations</a><br>\n        4 Day of Event</p>\n       \n      \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    </td>\n    <td valign=\"top\">\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/index.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/eim_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Just for Fun\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n       \n      <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/cc_pic.jpg\" width=\"120\"></p>\n      \n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc1.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/cnc_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Conversation &amp; Cuisine\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/playgroups.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/playgroup_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Playgroups\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/gametime.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/gametime_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to GameTime\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/evang.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/comrel_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Community Relations\" border=\"0\"></a> \n      </p>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/cc_pic.jpg","title":"Day of Event","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/dayofevent.htm"}

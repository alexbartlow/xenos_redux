He has a plan and the power to change family members into \n        becoming more loving &#x97; whether a spouse, parent or child. Has your \n        family experienced this? </p>\n      <p>He provides the direction for us to lead our family in a culture with \n        many influences &#x97; good and bad. He provides the power to be <b>IN</b> \n        that culture to reach those that need him most, yet not <b>OF</b> that \n        culture. When we fail as spouse or parent, he corrects us, re-directs \n        us and provides the actual power for change, even in our character when \n        our flaws get in the way of truly loving our children or spouse. </p>\n      <p>The need of <b>EVERY</b> family is for its members to have a personal \n        love relationship with Jesus Christ. Therefore, Xenos Christian Fellowship \n        is committed to serving the family by calling out the need for a personal \n        relationship with Jesus Christ. Consistent with that, we have developed \n        ministry that will help Christian families meet those who haven't yet \n        experienced a life-changing relationship with God. </p>\n      <p>Play groups provide a natural context to meet people and be used by God \n        to communicate about the greatness of knowing him personally through Jesus \n        Christ.</p>\n      <p>1 God's Love Impacting Families<br>\n        2 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgsharing.htm\">Too Busy to Share God's Love?</a><br>\n        3 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgdefined.htm\">What Is a Playgroup?</a><br>\n        4 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgparents.htm\">Who Is It For?</a><br>\n        5 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/plgactivities.htm\">Activities and Opportunities</a><br>\n        6 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgresults.htm\">Recent Results</a><br>\n        7 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgkeys.htm\">Keys for Success</a><br>\n        8 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgleaders.htm\">Leadership</a> <br>\n        9 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgworkers.htm\">Worker Meetings</a></p>\n       \n      \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    </td>\n    <td valign=\"top\">\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/index.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/eim_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Just for Fun\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n       \n      <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/playgroup_pic.jpg\" width=\"120\"></p>\n      \n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc1.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/cnc_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Conversation &amp; Cuisine\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/playgroups.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/playgroup_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Playgroups\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/gametime.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/gametime_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to GameTime\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/evang.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/comrel_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Community Relations\" border=\"0\"></a> \n      </p>\n    </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/playgroup_pic.jpg","title":"PlayGroup Network","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/playgroups.htm"}

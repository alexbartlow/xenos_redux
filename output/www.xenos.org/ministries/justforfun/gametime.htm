It is probably safe to \n        assume that Christ and Paul would look at that and get involved in order \n        to meet the people \"where they are at.\"&#xA0;That is GameTime \n        ministry's mission.&#xA0;It is a ministry that uses sports as an opportunity \n        to make new or deepen existing friendships. In doing so, we communicate \n        to our non-Christian friends that Christians are not wimps (as many believe), \n        nor are we \"out of touch\" (as too many sadly are), and that \n        God is not some cosmic kill-joy that once you follow him, all fun ends.&#xA0; \n        It is also a great opportunity to recreate with other members of the Body \n        of Christ.</p>\n      <h3>Who benefits?&#xA0; </h3>\n      <p>Home Groups enjoy using these leagues by signing up a team and inviting \n        their friends to join in.&#xA0; There is plenty of time on the bench, \n        between innings, and before and after games to get to know one another.&#xA0; \n      </p>\n      <p>People who aren't in home groups are often looking for ways to make new \n        friends and this is a comfortable venue for many.&#xA0; They can sign \n        up as an individual and will be assigned to a team.</p>\n      <p>We were thrilled to see that about one-third of the players in our 24-team \n        softball league were guests &#x97; friends of Xenos home group members. \n        Hopefully they experienced some of the love of Christ as they got to know \n        us!</p>\n      <h3>How do we administrate GameTime?</h3>\n      <p>GameTime is volunteer led by a servant team member. He is responsible \n        for arranging leagues with the local city recreational parks and facilities \n        for our softball, volleyball, and basketball leagues.&#xA0;We also apply \n        a small amount of church staff time to assist him in producing flyers, \n        putting announcements in our publications, etc.</p>\n      <h3>Questions?</h3>\n      <p>Feel free to give us a call at 614-823-6500 or <a href=\"mailto:gametime@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">send \n        us an email.</a></p>\n       \n      \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    </td>\n    <td valign=\"top\">\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/index.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/eim_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Just for Fun\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n       \n      <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/gametime_pic.jpg\" width=\"120\"></p>\n      \n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc1.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/cnc_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Conversation &amp; Cuisine\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/playgroups.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/playgroup_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Playgroups\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/gametime.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/gametime_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to GameTime\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/evang.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/comrel_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Community Relations\" border=\"0\"></a> \n      </p>\n    </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/gametime_pic.jpg","title":"GameTime Ministry","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/gametime.htm"}

The reason for the infrequent \n        schedule is to make it possible for parents to get a baby sitter without \n        feeling they are neglecting their children. Most adults will be willing \n        to get a baby sitter if the events are only once per quarter. Consequently, \n        we have the adults' full attention and their entire night available. (Contrast \n        this to evenings when guests bring their children and spend the whole \n        evening preoccupied with them.) </p>\n      <p>This ministry began in 1992 for the reasons described at the beginning \n        of this document. Churchwide, home groups are hosting 40-75 events \n        per year since then. It is fairly common to see a dozen guests or more \n        at an event and they typically are very appreciative of the hospitality \n        and openness during the discussion. It is not unusual to hear that their \n        exposure to Christians in this enjoyable, relaxed and non-threatening \n        environment enabled them, in the weeks and months following, to engage \n        their Christian friend in more spiritually oriented discussions and to \n        ask them questions.</p>\n      <p>Interested? <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/host_cc.htm\">Here's help</a> with hosting an event \n        and to take advantage of our materials. If you think of new topics \n        and/or menus, please <a href=\"mailto:cuisine@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=New%20C&amp;C%20topic\">share \n        them with us</a>. We'll be grateful. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/topics.htm\">&gt;&gt;</a></p>\n      <p><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=Conversation%20%26%20Cuisine\">Contact \n        Dennis with a comment or question</a> </p>\n      <p>1. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc1.htm\">What is Conversation &amp; Cuisine?</a><br>\n        2. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc2.htm\">Why a dinner-discussion party?</a><br>\n        3. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc3.htm\">What kind of dinner party would you like to go to \n        if invited?</a><br>\n        4.

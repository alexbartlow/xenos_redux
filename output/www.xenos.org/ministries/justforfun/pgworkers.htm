They must \n        be very practical in nature and oriented to the needs of busy parents \n        with young children. It is helpful to provide some child care. </p>\n      <p>Answers to prayer and the stories of play groups that have seen women \n        come to Christ or start Bible studies are inspiring. This is a great opportunity \n        for people to find new ideas for their group and realize that they are \n        not alone â€” other groups may be experiencing similar challenges or \n        rewards. </p>\n      <p>The meetings should be organized and on time. It is helpful to mention \n        the meeting to the leaders in the monthly phone call and then send postcard \n        invitations two weeks in advance to the leaders and workers of each play \n        group.</p>\n      <p>1 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/playgroups.htm\">Adult Evangelism Today</a><br>\n        2 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgdefined.htm\">What Is a Playgroup?</a><br>\n        3 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgparents.htm\">Who Is It For?</a><br>\n        4 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/plgactivities.htm\">Activities and Opportunities</a><br>\n        5 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgresults.htm\">Recent Results</a><br>\n        6 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgkeys.htm\">Keys for Success</a><br>\n        7 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgleaders.htm\">Leadership</a> <br>\n        8 Worker Meetings</p>\n       \n      \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    </td>\n    <td valign=\"top\">\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/index.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/eim_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Just for Fun\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n       \n      <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/playgroup_pic.jpg\" width=\"120\"></p>\n      \n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc1.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/cnc_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Conversation &amp; Cuisine\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/playgroups.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/playgroup_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Playgroups\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/gametime.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/gametime_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to GameTime\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/evang.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/comrel_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Community Relations\" border=\"0\"></a> \n      </p>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/playgroup_pic.jpg","title":"Playgroup Worker Meetings","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgworkers.htm"}

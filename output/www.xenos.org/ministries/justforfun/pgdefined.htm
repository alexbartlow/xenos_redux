Relationships that may be further developed beyond the \n        play group are established at these get-togethers. Ultimately, play groups \n        are a great environment for developing and nurturing lasting friendships.</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Each play group has its own character â€” dependent upon the individuals \n          involved. </li>\n        <li>They may meet weekly or bi-monthly in homes, at parks or they do other \n          activities (i.e. go to the zoo, McDonalds, swimming, etc.). </li>\n        <li>What will you do? Have snacks and coffee, enjoyable conversation, \n          discuss books on parenting, marriage, or other topics of interest. The \n          children also make friends and learn to play with one another. <br>\n          </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>1 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/playgroups.htm\">Adult Evangelism Today</a><br>\n        2 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgsharing.htm\">Too Busy to Share God's Love?</a><br>\n        3 What Is a Playgroup?<br>\n        4 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgparents.htm\">Who Is It For?</a><br>\n        5 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/plgactivities.htm\">Activities and Opportunities</a><br>\n        6 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgresults.htm\">Recent Results</a><br>\n        7 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgkeys.htm\">Keys for Success</a><br>\n        8 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgleaders.htm\">Leadership</a> <br>\n        9 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgworkers.htm\">Worker Meetings</a></p>\n       \n      \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    </td>\n    <td valign=\"top\">\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/index.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/eim_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Just for Fun\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n       \n      <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/playgroup_pic.jpg\" width=\"120\"></p>\n      \n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc1.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/cnc_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Conversation &amp; Cuisine\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/playgroups.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/playgroup_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Playgroups\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/gametime.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/gametime_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to GameTime\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/evang.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/comrel_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Community Relations\" border=\"0\"></a> \n      </p>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/playgroups2.jpg","title":"What Is a PlayGroup?","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgdefined.htm"}

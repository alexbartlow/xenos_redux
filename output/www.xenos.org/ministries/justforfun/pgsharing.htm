Additionally, \n        we do our children a grave disservice when we aren't demonstrating consistently \n        what it means to &#x93;love your neighbor as yourself.&#x94;</p>\n      <p>For practical help on balancing ministry at home and in the church, please \n        read, <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/balancing-home-church-ministry\">Balancing Home and Church \n        Ministries</a>.</p>\n      <p>Clearly, as parents, we must be creative in trying to find ways to be \n        used by God to extend the love of Jesus Christ to a lost world. One way \n        to do this is to find ways to include our children as we reach out to \n        others.

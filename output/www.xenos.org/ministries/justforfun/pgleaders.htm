Once to pray specifically for each play \n        group and another time to maintain vision for the future of the ministry \n        as well as plan for upcoming activities like worker meetings and the newsletter.<br>\n      </p>\n      <h3>Stats</h3>\n      <p>It can be helpful to keep track of how many play groups exist, their \n        location, how many women and children are involved in each one. New families \n        in our church are often looking for play groups close to them and this \n        information helps us to serve them.</p>\n      <h3>Phone calls</h3>\n      <p>Organize a group of women to help call each play group leader monthly \n        to encourage her. These play group leaders are on the front lines of the \n        spiritual battle and need prayer and support</p>\n      <h3>Quarterly Newsletter</h3>\n      <p>A newsletter will keep the leaders and workers of play groups updated \n        on ministry happenings and to encourage them to press on. We include a \n        review of the last quarterly meeting, an inspirational devotional, upcoming \n        classes and events available at church, suggested books to read, prayer \n        requests for the ministry as a whole, the mission statement, and ministry \n        leaders' phone numbers. You can also consider developing a seeker sensitive \n        newsletter. Think about how you can facilitate discussions or special \n        outings through topics of interest or announcements, then make the newsletter \n        available to anyone in a play group associated with your church.</p>\n      <h3>Character</h3>\n      <p>Ministry leaders must demonstrate the character qualities listed in scripture. \n        Also, the <b>gifts of administration, leadership, evangelism, shepherding</b> \n        and <b>encouragement</b> are important gifts for any leadership team. \n        <b>Spiritual maturity</b> and a <b>willingness</b> to serve are the key \n        issues for our leaders. <br>\n      </p>\n      <p>1 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/playgroups.htm\">Adult Evangelism Today</a><br>\n        2 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgsharing.htm\">Too Busy to Share God's Love?</a><br>\n        3 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgdefined.htm\">What Is a Playgroup?</a><br>\n        4 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgparents.htm\">Who Is It For?</a><br>\n        5 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/plgactivities.htm\">Activities and Opportunities</a><br>\n        6 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgresults.htm\">Recent Results</a><br>\n        7 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgkeys.htm\">Keys for Success</a><br>\n        8 Leadership <br>\n        9 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgworkers.htm\">Worker Meetings</a></p>\n       \n      \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    </td>\n    <td valign=\"top\">\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/index.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/eim_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Just for Fun\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n       \n      <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/playgroup_pic.jpg\" width=\"120\"></p>\n      \n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc1.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/cnc_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Conversation &amp; Cuisine\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/playgroups.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/playgroup_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Playgroups\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/gametime.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/gametime_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to GameTime\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/evang.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/comrel_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Community Relations\" border=\"0\"></a> \n      </p>\n    </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/playgroup_pic.jpg","title":"PlayGroup Leadership","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgleaders.htm"}

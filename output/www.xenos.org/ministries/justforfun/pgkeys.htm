Only \n        those who love their neighbors will consistently have the motivation to \n        succeed. When with non-believing friends, be open and honest about your \n        relationship with Christ and the fact that several friends from your church, \n        Xenos Christian Fellowship, developed this play group because you enjoy \n        meeting new friends. </p>\n      <h3>The Invitation</h3>\n      <p>Pray for and respond to opportunities to invite people to your playgroup. \n        An <b>ESSENTIAL</b> component of inviting folks to join will be openness \n        and candor about your affiliation to your church. If your group was started \n        by women in your church or bible study, be clear about that up front in \n        the invitation itself. You can communicate that the playgroup isn't a \n        Bible study. Its a great time to have some fun, allowing your children \n        to learn how to play with others while parents can enjoy time with other \n        adults. Without mentioning our connection to our church, we are misrepresenting \n        ourselves and God. We <b>WANT</b> our friends to experience God's love \n        in our playgroup, and know the source of it as well. </p>\n      <p>Are you in a playgroup that was started by others, perhaps not directly \n        affiliated with a church at all? If you have a heart for seeing those \n        families experience the love of God, push yourself to be open about your \n        own relationship with God as early as possible in your friendships. As \n        God leads, seek opportunities to invite others the playgroup as a means \n        of building into new and existing friendships. Be sure to find creative \n        ways to bring friends from your own church into contact with your playgroup, \n        and be certain to pray with other Christian women about your desire to \n        see your friends know God personally.<br>\n      </p>\n      <h3><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/playgroups4.jpg\" width=\"150\">Teamwork</h3>\n      <p>This is critical for support in prayer and for letting non-Christians \n        see the love of the body of Christ at work. The joy and love in the lives \n        of Christian women has drawn other women to Christ. Successful play groups \n        work closely with their home group/cell group in pursuing ministry goals. \n        <br>\n      </p>\n      <h3>Prayer</h3>\n      <p>Without prayer nothing substantial will be accomplished. We must be alert \n        to the spiritual battle and actively engaged in spiritual warfare. Specific \n        and consistent prayer for each woman and her family is vital to seeing \n        them come to know Christ. <br>\n      </p>\n      <h3>Building relationships</h3>\n      <p>This ministry is primarily based on friendship. We know it takes time \n        and effort to build and maintain relationships. There must be a genuine \n        desire to befriend and love others. Pray about this area&#x85;God can \n        grow your heart to new levels of commitment to others. <br>\n      </p>\n      <h3>Humility</h3>\n      <p>Be willing to learn from others and find common ground. Be genuine, open, \n        and honest with the women about who you are, including your Christian \n        convictions, early in your relationships. Being up front about your relationship \n        with Jesus early and often will give the non-Christian more opportunity \n        to understand the source for your love for others. <br>\n      </p>\n      <h3>Planning</h3>\n      <p>People appreciate organization. Play group schedules can help. For example \n        they can list the activities for the next two months along with a phone \n        list that includes all the names of play group members and their families \n        and the birthdays of their children. Think ahead about what the needs \n        of each of the women are and how Christ can meet those needs. <br>\n      </p>\n      <h3>Consistency</h3>\n      <p>It is important to initiate with the women between play group meetings. \n        Regular contact helps to deepen and strengthen a friendship. This is important \n        because it demonstrates the love of God to someone who does not yet know \n        Christ. Additionally, there are not necessarily many opportunities for \n        long conversations during a play group gathering, while gettting together \n        outside play group is much more conducive to developing relationships! \n      </p>\n      <p>1 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/playgroups.htm\">Adult Evangelism Today</a><br>\n        2 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgsharing.htm\">Too Busy to Share God's Love?</a><br>\n        3 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgdefined.htm\">What Is a Playgroup?</a><br>\n        4 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgparents.htm\">Who Is It For?</a><br>\n        5 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/plgactivities.htm\">Activities and Opportunities</a><br>\n        6 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgresults.htm\">Recent Results</a><br>\n        7 Keys for Success<br>\n        8 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgleaders.htm\">Leadership</a> <br>\n        9 <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgworkers.htm\">Worker Meetings</a></p>\n       \n      \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    </td>\n    <td valign=\"top\">\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/index.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/eim_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Just for Fun\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n       \n      <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/playgroup_pic.jpg\" width=\"120\"></p>\n      \n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc1.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/cnc_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Conversation &amp; Cuisine\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/playgroups.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/playgroup_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Playgroups\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/gametime.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/gametime_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to GameTime\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/evang.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/graphics/comrel_button.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"go to Community Relations\" border=\"0\"></a> \n      </p>\n    </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/playgroups4.jpg","title":"PlayGroup Keys for Success","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/pgkeys.htm"}

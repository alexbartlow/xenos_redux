It revolves around passion, commitment, resolve \n    and many other intangible values. A life-style is best transferred from person \n    to person through modeling. It is the biblical pattern for transferring our \n    faith from parents to children (Deuteronomy. 6). Modeling is the most effective \n    way of transferring mission vision from one person to another. </p>\n  <p>There \n    are a number of ways a church can expose its people to good mission models. \n    I know missionaries who are not good public speakers, but who are very effective \n    in small group home meetings. When you think of it, short-term missions is \n    effective when participants rub shoulders with missionaries and nationals. \n    Some of the ways to expose people to good mission models are through the pastor \n    who can model a world Christian attitude to the congregation, or missionaries \n    and third-world leaders who can be brought into Sunday School meetings, home \n    meetings, conferences, etc. Mission committee members and mission leadership \n    can model a world Christian attitude to others wherever they are. Conferences \n    can expose church leaders and members. Churches can mentor other churches \n    in world missions. Note that good mission models always have at least the \n    three characteristics of compassion, competence and consistency. </p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/dynamics9.htm\">next \n    page</a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n  \n</td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Seven Dynamics - Modeling","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/dynamics8.htm"}

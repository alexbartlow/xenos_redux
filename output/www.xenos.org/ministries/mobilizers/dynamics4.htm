This places the mission leadership in a very \n    active role of recruiting individuals of every age to participate in the mission \n    vision of the church. Vision without management leads to frustration. </p>\n  <p>This \n    view of management is a departure from the traditional view of mission participation. \n    The traditional challenge to churches has been &#x93;some can go, some can \n    give, all can pray.&#x94; I have learned that this view is limiting and even \n    demotivating. Even the terms &#x93;goers&#x94; and \"senders&#x94; are too \n    simplistic. Missions used to be \"long term&#x94; and &#x93;over there&#x94; \n    and therefore limited to the professional missionary. While professionals \n    are still needed, many opportunities now exist doing &#x93;short-term&#x94; \n    work &#x93;right here&#x94; where lay people can become involved. Personal \n    involvement is a primary motivation for contemporary audiences. The function \n    of management leadership is to help every member to use his or her spiritual \n    gifts and experiences to help carry out the mission vision of the church. \n    Mission-active churches find creative ways for getting individuals directly \n    and personally involved in local and foreign cross-cultural missions. Short-term \n    missions, international students and local ethnic ministries are among the \n    most common methods used. </p>\n  <p>Although \n    the management structure will differ from church to church, there is normally \n    a &#x93;missions pro,&#x94; either a volunteer or staff, who is the key vision \n    imparter. The mission pro also has the ability to organize teams whose main \n    purpose is to get different types of people involved to carry out the vision \n    of the church. Joel Roberts, mission pastor at Evergreen Baptist Church in \n    Rosemead, California, has forty-seven different teams in his church involved \n    in local domestic and foreign mission projects. Roberts says that missions \n    has become the &#x93;in-thing&#x94; for the church. Personal involvement on \n    the part of members has been the main key. Incidentally, mission giving in \n    this church has gone from $70,000 to $400,000 per year in just five years. \n    </p>\n  <p>The \n    management dynamic also includes a strategic plan. Effective mission programs \n    have a written plan that includes a motto, a vision statement, core values, \n    strategy and goals. Mission-active churches do not fly by the seat of their \n    pants! They know exactly where they are going and what they need to get there. \n    Aubrey Malphurs' book &#x93;Developing a Vision for Your Ministry in the 21st \n    Century&#x94; is very helpful in this regard to explain how to develop a strategic \n    plan. </p>\n  <p>As \n    a suggestion, one of the routes to getting people involved in frontier missions \n    may be to give them a hands-on exposure to regular missions. Then in the context \n    of regular missions, people can be challenged with the needs of the unreached \n    on the final frontiers. Personal involvement is key to mobilizing churches \n    for missions, including frontier missions!  \n     \n    </p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/dynamics5.htm\">next \n    page</a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n            \n  </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Seven Dynamics - Management","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/dynamics4.htm"}

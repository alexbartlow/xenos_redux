Intergration \n    helps overcome the tendency to marginalize missions to a department in the \n    church. If God is a missionary God, and the Bible is a missionary book, then \n    missions should be a natural and central part of the life of the Church, involving \n    everyone in the Church. The intent of the integration dynamic, then, is to \n    make mission education and participation a spontaneous part of every age group \n    and program in the church. The intent is not to compete for people and finances, \n    nor is it to try to make missionaries out of everyone. However, it is our \n    conviction that every ministry in the church ultimately exists to help the \n    church fulfill its role in world evangelization! </p>\n  <p>The \n    integration dynamic accepts the fact that people have different receptivity \n    levels. Everyone is not going to be a mission enthusiast over-night. There \n    always will be people open to missions, and those who are closed to missions. \n    The integration dynamic allows for these various levels of receptivity and \n    deals with people where they are. </p>\n  <p>It \n    is critical that mission enthusiasts refrain from projecting unrealistic expectations \n    on people. Mission leaders have a special inclination towards missions that \n    God uses to mobilize others. But if this inclination and zeal is overdone, \n    mission leadership can very easily come across as dogmatic or fanatical. The \n    goal is to attract people to missions, not to drive them away. Mission enthusiasts \n    have been known to do great damage to the cause by their overzealous attitudes \n    and approaches. </p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/dynamics7.htm\">next \n    page</a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n  \n</td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Seven Dynamics - Integration","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/dynamics6.htm"}

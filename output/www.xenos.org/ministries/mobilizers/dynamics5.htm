Just as all believers must dedicate \n    themselves to personal spiritual disciplines in order to progress spiritually, \n    in the same way every church must dedicate itself to certain mission-related \n    spiritual disciplines in order to maintain and grow an outward mission focus. \n    Any mission program will fail if it is not built on healthy spiritual disciplines. \n    </p>\n  <p>Each \n    discipline serves as an antidote to cultural forces that are undermining mission \n    involvement. Corporate prayer for world evangelization serves as an antidote \n    to the secular influence of American culture. Local evangelism serves as an \n    antidote to the pluralism of our society. Mission giving breaks the grip of \n    materialism. Sending missionaries from one's own congregation, makes missions \n    very personal and tangible and counteracts the self-centeredness of our American \n    way of life. Helping to mobilize other congregations in missions helps mission \n    leadership in the church to give away their expertise instead of hoarding \n    it for themselves. </p>\n  <p>Adopting \n    an unreached people group is a great spiritual discipline for a church because \n    it forces us to focus on the task remaining instead of focusing on oneself \n    or on one's own missionary. Praying, witnessing, giving, sending, mobilizing \n    and adopting are all spiritual disciplines that counteract the negative forces \n    of our culture and nurture our participation in God's global cause! There \n    is a spiritual dynamic at work in each of these disciplines that gives spiritual \n    blessings that cannot be understood nor explained naturally.  \n     \n     \n    </p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/dynamics6.htm\">next \n    page</a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n  \n</td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Seven Dynamics - Spiritual Disciplines","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/dynamics5.htm"}

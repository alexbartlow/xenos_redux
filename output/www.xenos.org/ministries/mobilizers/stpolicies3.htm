The primary decision then, becomes which of our long-term \n              fields are able to host a short-term team. Many factors impact the \n              ability of our long-term fields to host a trip such as the progress \n              made in cultural adaptation and language learning, the extent of \n              relationships developed with nationals, the establishment of ministry, \n              and political stability. Within the potential fields, prioritization \n              will be given to where there is an immediate need for additional \n              workers. Other considerations in the selection of mission field \n              may include the experience of the field leaders in hosting short-term \n              trips, the experience of the trip leader(s), or the existence of \n              a &#x93;golden opportunity&#x94; within or even outside our long-term \n              fields. Other relief and development projects may also be undertaken \n              from time to time, as deemed appropriate. Ultimately, the final \n              decision rests with the Management Team and Elders of Xenos Christian \n              Fellowship. </p>\n            \n            <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/stpolicies4.htm\">next \n              page</a>&#xBB; <br>\n              <br>\n              <br>\n              </b></p>\n            \n</td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Short-term Mission Trips within Xenos - Mission Field","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/stpolicies3.htm"}

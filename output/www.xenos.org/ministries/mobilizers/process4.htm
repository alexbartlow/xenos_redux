From it comes the prayer, manpower, finances (and in some \n    cases, strategies) for missions. The job will get done only if there is dynamic \n    teamwork between congregations of believers and the sending and training structures \n    as together they seek to establish viable, indigenous churches among unreached \n    peoples. </p>\n  <p><b>Sent \n    Ones, Senders, Welcomers and Mobilizers</b> <br>\n    Every believer is called in either one of two ways to be involved in the task \n    of world evangelization. Both of the callings require the same consecration \n    to and confirmation of God's leading. A &#x93;sent one&#x94; is a cross-cultural \n    worker on the field. With today's massive influx of immigrants to various \n    countries throughout the world, the field is now in our own backyards. Those \n    who reach out to immigrants and international students and visitors have recently \n    been called &#x93;welcomers.&#x94; &#x93;Senders&#x94; are those believers \n    on the home front with a world vision who are actively involved in supporting \n    the &#x93;sent ones.&#x94; Last but not least are the &#x93;mobilizers.&#x94; \n    Whether positioned over a local church, city, region, country or continent, \n    mobilizers are those who channel key resources, training and vision for world \n    evangelization to the Body of Christ. </p>\n  <p><b>Closure \n    </b><br>\n    Our common goal toward which the entire Body of Christ is to labor is the \n    fulfillment of God's climactic vision as revealed in Rev. 5:9 and Rev. 7:9 \n    where some from every tribe, tongue, people and nation are depicted as gathered \n    around the throne of the Lamb. Due to massive spiritual forces arrayed against \n    the missionary task of the Church (Satan knows well that world evangelization \n    will terminate his reign on earth), fortitude is needed to press forward through \n    trials and obstacles in finishing the task. </p>\n  <p><b>Seven \n    Years </b><br>\n    This figure brings a sobering tone into our task of mobilizing. Just as the \n    average span of time between the moment someone first gains a World Christian \n    conviction and the moment that person ends up working within an unreached \n    people group is seven years. So the time to initiate a mission movement in \n    a fellowship, city and region may take three to seven years. If we refuse \n    to face this time factor realistically, we may begin the race well but not \n    develop the perseverance necessary to finish well. Once we accept this time \n    factor we can begin to prayerfully plan the key steps we should take to build \n    a movement in our city or region. </p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/process5.htm\">next \n    page</a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n            \n</td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Forces in the Gap","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/process4.htm"}

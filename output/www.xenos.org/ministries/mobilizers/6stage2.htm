This means some \n      kind of personal contact or visual tools such as videos, brochures, etc. \n      </li>\n    <li><b>Moving \n      from Aware to Interested</b> requires identifying with a felt need or appealing \n      to a personal value. Common means of doing this include Bible messages or \n      applications which feature God's heart for all peoples. </li>\n    <li><b>Moving \n      from Interested to Concerned</b> requires introduction of a personal dimension \n      to increase desire for involvement. This means getting people involved emotionally, \n      but it doesn't mean telling only sad stories or \"laying a guilt trip\" on \n      people. The root of the word emotion is motion. Emotion is what gets us \n      into action. </li>\n    <li><b>Moving \n      from Concerned to Involved</b> requires a specific opportunity to act. It \n      is not enough to urge people to pray, give or go - we usually must provide \n      the means (request, time, place, address, account number, flight number, \n      etc.) to do these things. Many people end up frustrated because they want \n      to be involved, but don't have the specific opportunity or information at \n      the point they are motivated to act. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Another \n    dimension of the model introduces the aspect of scope. There are at least \n    three levels at which an individual can be involved in world evangelization: \n    the global/universal, the organizational and the personal/individual. We could \n    display these levels on the model as indicated in the figure at the top of \n    the next page. </p>\n            <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/graphics/missions_6stagemodel3.gif\" width=\"450\"> \n              </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>The \n      global/universal dimension focus on God's heart of love for all peoples, \n      his strategy to establish the Church of Jesus Christ within each group and \n      His mandate to us to disciple all the nations. </li>\n    <li>The \n      organizational dimension focuses on the specific aspect of God's work in \n      the world that is being carried on in a particular congregation or through \n      a particular mission agency or organization. </li>\n    <li>The \n      personal/individual dimension focuses on the ministry of workers or families \n      who are planting churches, evangelizing or discipling other believers.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/6stage2.htm\">next \n    page</a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n            \n  \n</td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Six-Stage Mobilization Model","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/6stage2.htm"}

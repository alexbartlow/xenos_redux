He know where God was leading \n        him and could take others along. </h3>\n      <ol>\n        <li>The main focus of his communication was Christ. (Acts 17:2-3; 1 Corinthians \n          15:3-4; Galatians 6:14) This is especially true for the pluralistic \n          world in which we live. </li>\n        <li>Paul seemed consumed with completing the Great Commission. This is \n          seen in his constant references to eschatological events. He sensed \n          and labored with an urgency to the Gospel message. </li>\n        <li>Extending Gospel influence to those who never heard was a central \n          motivation. (Romans 15:17-24; 2 Corinthians 10:15-16) </li>\n        <li>He knew how important it was to finish well and did so. (1 Corinthians \n          9:24-27; 2 Timothy 4:6-8) </li>\n      </ol>\n      <p><i>Application:</i> Ensure that trainees really see the big picture and \n        grasp their God ordained role. </p>\n      <h3>When looking at how Paul ministered and what he did we see many helpful \n        principles for missionary life today. Here are a few on which you can \n        build: </h3>\n      <ol>\n        <li>Lay hands on no man quickly. Make sure ministers have time to prove \n          their character. </li>\n        <li>The main thing of church planting and nurture must remain the main \n          thing. </li>\n        <li>Flexibility in lifestyle and thinking is critical. He became all things \n          to all men to win some. </li>\n        <li>A developed sensitivity to the Holy Spirit is essential (Acts 16:6-9). \n        </li>\n        <li>Having a thought through strategy is the place to start. He first \n          went to cities and synagogues to establish a ministry beachhead. </li>\n        <li>Satan is our main opponent and preparation for spiritual warfare with \n          power encounters is important. </li>\n        <li>Ministry is partnership. Learn to work together with other ministers \n          and churches. </li>\n        <li>Combine formal with non-formal training for effective results (Acts \n          19:8-10) </li>\n        <li>Build deeply into key people who in turn will build into others (Titus, \n          2 Timothy 2:2)</li>\n        <li>Ministry requires perseverance. Expect all kinds of obstacles and \n          suffering if you are doing something significant for the advance of \n          the Kingdom of God. </li>\n      </ol>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/go_fields.htm\">Choice Fields </a>&#xBB; \n        </p>\n       \n      \n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/go.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/graphics/gosmall.gif\" width=\"120\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Missions Prefield Training Manual\"></a> \n      </p>\n      \n       \n      <div><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/index.htm\">Home</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/aware.htm\">Awareness</a> l <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/involve.htm\">Involvement</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/join.htm\">Join</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/passport.htm\">Passport</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/calendar.htm\">Calendar</a> \n        <br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/missions.htm\">Missions \n        Dept</a></div>\n    </td>\n  \n</table>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Principles of Missionary Training from Paul","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/go_principles2.htm"}

The Angels then asked, \n        &#x93;Did all the people in the world hear the good news?&#x94; &#x93;No, \n        they didn't&#x94; Jesus replied. &#x93;Well, how will the world hear? \n        We wish we could go but we can't.&#x94; Jesus explained. &#x93;I left \n        12 men to carry on.&#x94; The Angels said soberly, &#x93;What is your \n        plan B?&#x94; Jesus reflected, &#x93;I have no plan B.&#x94; </p>\n      <p>God's plan for communicating His love to a lost world has been and always \n        will be, the man or woman of God, equipped with the Word of God, empowered \n        by the Spirit of God, to accomplish the Will of God. </p>\n      <p>The task of the church is: to obey the Will of God, submit to the direction \n        of the Spirit of God, hold forth the standard of the Word of God, to produce \n        godly men and women prepared for every good work. </p>\n      <p>The New Testament tells us that Jesus came to earth for at least 14 reasons. \n        (Matthew 5:17; Matthew 10:34-35; Mark 1:38; Mark 2:17; Mark 10:45; Luke \n        19:10; John 6:38; John 9:37; John 10:10; John 12:27; John 12:46; John \n        18:38; John 20:21; I Timothy 1:15). One of these primary reasons was to \n        train a band of men who would carry out the task of world evangelization. \n      </p>\n      <p>Note the strength of His statements in John 17, His high priestly prayer: \n      </p>\n      <p> <b>v. 4</b>: &#x93;I have accomplished the work&#x94;<br>\n        <b>v. 6</b>: &#x93;I have manifested Your name to the men&#x94; <br>\n        <b>v. 7:</b> &#x93;they have come to know&#x94;<br>\n        <b>v. 8:</b> &#x93;they have received, understood, believed&#x94; <br>\n        <b>v. 9:</b> &#x93;I have asked for them&#x94;<br>\n        <b>v. 11:</b> &#x93;keep them, that they may be one&#x94;<br>\n        <b>v. 12:</b> &#x93;I was keeping, I guarded&#x94;<br>\n        <b>v. 13:</b> &#x93;they may have My joy&#x94;<br>\n        <b>v. 14:</b> &#x93;I have given them Your word&#x94;<br>\n        <b>v. 15:</b> &#x93;keep them&#x94;<br>\n        <b>v. 17:</b> &#x93;sanctify them&#x94;<br>\n        <b>v. 18:</b> &#x93;I have sent them&#x94;<br>\n        <b>v. 19:</b> &#x93;they may be sanctified&#x94;<br>\n        <b>v. 20:</b> &#x93;I do not ask for these alone&#x94;<br>\n        <b>v. 21:</b> &#x93;they may be one, they also may be in us&#x94;<br>\n        <b>v. 22:</b> &#x93;I have given them (glory), they may be one&#x94;<br>\n        <b>v. 23:</b> &#x93;THAT THE WORLD MAY KNOW&#x94;<br>\n        <b>v. 24:</b> &#x93;they may be with Me, and behold My glory&#x94;<br>\n        <b>v. 25:</b> &#x93;these have known that You did send Me&#x94;<br>\n        <b>v. 26:</b> &#x93;I have made Your name known to them, that love may \n        be in them&#x94; </p>\n      \n      <h3><b>Selection</b> </h3>\n      <p>Jesus devoted Himself primarily to a few men rather than the masses in \n        order that the masses could be saved. (Luke 6:12-13) </p>\n      <p>Choosing the right men to work with was a serious decision. Jesus spent \n        an entire night in prayer, what do we do? Most of the men were very ordinary \n        with many shortcomings. Jesus did see potential. Discernment is a precious \n        gift. The men were teachable and had a heart for God. </p>\n      <p><i>Application:</i> Choose your people wisely. Be proactive rather than \n        reactive. </p>\n      <h3>Association </h3>\n      <p>Jesus spent much time with those whom He was training. (Mark 3:14) </p>\n      <p>The man were constantly &#x93;with Him.&#x94; They caught far more than \n        they were taught. Jesus progressively spent more time (not less) with \n        his men closer to His departure. Such investment of time was at personal \n        sacrifice&#x97;He had little time to call His own. Jesus always was focused \n        on the task of impacting the world but knew that the best way to do that \n        was by concentration. </p>\n      <p><i>Application:</i> Invest heavily in a few. Ensure ongoing contact with \n        those chosen for training. </p>\n      <h3><b>Consecration</b> </h3>\n      <p>Jesus was obedient to God and He requires obedience from His disciples. \n        (Luke 16:13) </p>\n      <p>People desire to find a cause worth living for. People can and will rise \n        to the level of expectations desired if they believe in the cause. Jesus \n        endured with the disciples faltering because they were willing to continue \n        in training. Jesus did not urge them to commit to a doctrine or a program \n        but to a person. They followed Jesus because He was modeling the will \n        of God. Learning to follow is a necessary prerequisite for one day becoming \n        a leader. </p>\n      <p><i>Application:</i> Expect trainees to meet high expectations </p>\n      <h3><b>Impartation</b> </h3>\n      <p>Jesus gave His man all He had to give. (John 17:19) </p>\n      <p>Knowing that these men would carry on after He ascended, Jesus provided \n        the best training possible. He taught them directly and introduced them \n        to situations and people from which they would learn. Jesus designed different \n        lessons to meet the needs of each disciple. The context of learning was \n        largely within the group but individual attention was frequently given. \n        He assured the provision of the Holy Spirit as a continuing instructor \n        who would enable them to surpass the greatness of His ministry (John 14:12). \n        Ultimately, He gave His life for them and for those who would follow them. \n      </p>\n      <p><i>Application:</i> Know the trainee and personalize training according \n        to his God given design. </p>\n      <h3>Demonstration:<br>\n      </h3>\n      <p>Jesus personally showed the disciples how to live and minister as a servant \n        of God. (John 13:15) </p>\n      <p>There was absolute congruence between what Jesus said and did. He taught \n        and modeled that a dependency upon God in prayer was essential (more than \n        20 references in the Gospels to prayer). Jesus referred to the Scriptures \n        constantly and showed a high view of the Bible. Jesus' heart for the lost \n        oozed out constantly through acts of compassion. He never expected the \n        disciples to do something they hadn't first seen Him do. </p>\n      <p><i>Application:</i> Connecting trainees with experienced practitioners \n        is more valuable than good schooling. </p>\n      <h3><b>Delegation</b><br>\n      </h3>\n      <p>Jesus trained with His end in view&#x97;the disciples were to carry on \n        the ministry. (Luke 9:1-2) </p>\n      <p>Jesus gradually involved the disciples in direct ministry. For the first \n        year they only observed. Then they went out together as the twelve. Later \n        he sent them out among the seventy. Along the way they had isolated assignments \n        mostly to challenge their values and learn to live by faith. It was essential \n        for them to catch the vision of discipling all peoples. Some lessons take \n        a long time to learn because of prejudice and pre-conceived ideas. </p>\n      <p><i>Application:</i> Provide trainees with a variety of local ministry \n        opportunities and increasing levels of responsibility (local evangelism, \n        international students, ethnic outreach) </p>\n      <h3><b>Supervision</b><br>\n      </h3>\n      <p>Jesus remained close by to observe and clarify. (Matthew 14:13-33) </p>\n      <p>Tell them, show them, watch them, let them. Jesus encouraged the disciples \n        to ask questions and to take initiative. In the learning process, Jesus \n        often stood back and let the disciples experience difficulties without \n        coming to their immediate rescue. Training is most effective when it comes \n        at or near the time of perceived need. Jesus even created situations to \n        surface needs the disciples did not yet recognize. In the midst of supervision, \n        He always expected their best (faith) and kept the big vision before them. \n      </p>\n      <p><i>Application:</i> Good training requires a variety of transparent models: \n        coach, teacher, discipler, sponsor. </p>\n      <h3><b>Reproduction</b></h3>\n      <p>Jesus modeled and expected fruitfulness, not just faithfulness To reproduce \n        is by God's design. (John 15:16) </p>\n      <p>Something or one who does not reproduce is abnormal. Along with modeling \n        a life of reproducing in the disciples what the Father sent Him to do, \n        Jesus clearly taught reproduction in the Great Commission passages. He \n        also made the point to have the disciple pray for laborers so they would \n        feel the pull themselves. </p>\n      <p><i>Application:</i> Bring trainees face to face with people who are reproducing \n        in various ministries. </p>\n      <p><span><a name=\"footnote\"></a>*Robert \n        Coleman's book, <i>The Master Plan of Evangelism</i>, was a primary resource \n        for gleaning these principles.  </span> </p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/go_principles2.htm\">Principles \n        from Paul</a>&#xBB; </p>\n       \n      \n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/go.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/graphics/gosmall.gif\" width=\"120\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Missions Prefield Training Manual\"></a> \n      </p>\n      \n       \n      <div><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/index.htm\">Home</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/aware.htm\">Awareness</a> l <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/involve.htm\">Involvement</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/join.htm\">Join</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/passport.htm\">Passport</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/calendar.htm\">Calendar</a> \n        <br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/missions.htm\">Missions \n        Dept</a></div>\n    </td>\n  \n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Principles of Missionary Training from Jesus","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/go_principles1.htm"}

As I have observed mission programs around the country, \n    visionary leadership is the driving force common to all effective programs. \n    I have found two crucial dimensions to leadership: </p>\n  <p>The \n    first is a clear, compelling and growing understanding of what God is doing. \n    Visionary leaders understand that the foundation to a mission-active church \n    is a congregation with a solid and growing biblical theology of missions. \n    As believers begin to understand that God indeed is a missionary God and that \n    the Bible is a missionary book, it virtually becomes self-evident that the \n    church is to be mission active. A sound biblical theology will clearly demonstrate \n    that &#x93;frontier missions&#x94; is not a side issue for the radical few, \n    but rather is the center stage in a 4000-year-long drama with the spot light \n    on the Lord of the universe who is declaring His glory to all nations?His \n    wonders to all peoples. (<a href=\"\">1</a>)</p>\n  <p>Luke \n    24:45 says that &#x93;Jesus opened their minds that they might understand \n    the Scriptures.&#x94; Christians today suffer the same kind of cultural and \n    experiential biases that distort their vision and understanding of God's Word. \n    Visionary leaders find resources to teach the biblical basis of missions beginning \n    in Genesis. In addition, they find ways of telling the story of God's glory \n    as it has developed since the first century, showing the incredible progress \n    of missions throughout the years. Then, coming to our day, they demonstrate \n    the fact that there are adequate resources to finish the remaining task. </p>\n  <p>The \n    first dimension of vision, explaining God's relentless and glorious redemptive \n    purpose, provides the stimulus for a very natural and even spontaneous Christian \n    response. It counters the pluralism and materialism of our North American \n    culture and makes missions central to our Christianity. Once we understand \n    that God's redemptive purpose is to redeem a people from every people in order \n    to display His glory, then our natural response is: &#x93;If that is what \n    God is doing, then what role can I and my church play?&#x94; </p>\n  <p>This \n    leads us to the second dimension of vision. I would like to refer to Barna's \n    definition of organizational vision: </p>\n  <dir>&#x93;Vision \n    is the clear mental image of a preferable future, imparted by God to His chosen \n    servants. It is based upon an accurate understanding of God, yourself and \n    your circumstance.&#x94; (George Barna, \"The Power of Vision\") </dir>\n  <p>This \n    second dimension of vision does two things. It gives direction and focus and \n    also energizes members of the church to become involved in the vision. Vision \n    is critical in this information age because vision helps us to prioritize \n    among a constant barrage of competing needs, opportunities and choices. A \n    mission program with a clear vision makes world evangelization tangible and \n    doable even for one local church. Although no one church by itself can evangelize \n    all the unreached peoples, yet, if a church were to adopt one people group, \n    then the task becomes very specific, and individuals within a church can see \n    how they can contribute personally, which can energize a whole congregation. \n    The bottom line is that resources follow vision. James Engel has said that \n    &#x93;Resources come where there is vision, and the big job is to raise vision.&#x94; \n    How can a church increase resources for missions? The problem is not lack \n    of money. It's lack of vision.

The goal \n        is to reach unreached people groups. </p>\n      <p>To function in a Biblical way, the church must be involved in missions \n        (Mt 28:18-20).</p>\n      <h3>Phase 1: Preliminary Interest</h3>\n      <p>Through teachings, and modeling by the leadership, some members in the \n        church develop a preliminary interest in missions. For some in this phase, \n        the burden will grow into a more serious exploration of their potential \n        role in missions.</p>\n      <h3>Phase 2: Exploration</h3>\n      <p>When a Christian worker in XCF is selected to be on our Servant Team \n        (deacon), he/she moves into a higher priority category for missions. The \n        equipping, training, character development and ministry experience it \n        takes to be a Servant Team member means he/she is well on the way to a \n        possible career in missions.</p>\n      <h3>Phase 3: Preparation</h3>\n      <p>The elders/management team in conjunction with the missions staff target \n        some members to prepare to GO to a Xenos field. People in Phase 3 are \n        invited to attend World Team's assessment center.</p>\n      <p>At any point in this process, people may decide to stop pursuing their \n        interest in a missionary career. They can be used by God as missions active \n        members through prayer, financial and other home-based support and mobilizing \n        others to GO.</p>\n      <h3>Phase 4: RACE</h3>\n      <p>World Team's assessment center. Candidates are assessed in a variety \n        of areas for necessary skills, knowledge and gifting. World Team may offer \n        suggestions or requirements before candidates are released to begin partnership \n        development.</p>\n      <h3>Phase 5: Appointment</h3>\n      <p>This phase includes final preparation, training, partnership development, \n        accreditation process. At this point the candidates would be formally \n        sent by the church to reach the unreached.</p>\n      <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/go_questions.htm\">Frequently \n        Asked Questions</a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n       \n      \n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/go.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/graphics/gosmall.gif\" width=\"120\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Missions Prefield Training Manual\"></a> \n      </p>\n      \n       \n      <div><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/index.htm\">Home</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/aware.htm\">Awareness</a> l <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/involve.htm\">Involvement</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/join.htm\">Join</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/passport.htm\">Passport</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/calendar.htm\">Calendar</a> \n        <br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/missions.htm\">Missions \n        Dept</a></div>\n    </td>\n  \n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Awareness and Preparation Process","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/go_overview.htm"}

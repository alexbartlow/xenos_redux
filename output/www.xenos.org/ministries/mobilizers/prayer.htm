Missions is God \n    at work. If He isn&#x92;t working in and through His people to accomplish His purposes, \n    nothing eternal is getting done. </p>\n  <p>The \n    apostle Paul was a great missionary who often urged God&#x92;s people to pray for \n    him. He linked the success of His missions to the faithful prayer support \n    of the saints of God: </p>\n  <p>&#x93;We \n    do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about the hardships we suffered \n    in the province of Asia. We were under great pressure far beyond our ability \n    to endure, so that we despaired even of life. In our hearts, we felt the sentence \n    of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, \n    who raises the dead. He has delivered us from a deadly peril, and He will \n    deliver us. On Him we have set our hope that He will continue to deliver us, \n    as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our behalf for \n    the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many.&#x94; 2 Corinthians \n    1:8-11 </p>\n  <p>Paul \n    describes his terrible trials, yet speaks confidently of God&#x92;s deliverance. \n    Paul is sure that God will sustain him as the believers help in prayer. </p>\n  <p>Prayer \n    links us to the most exciting aspects of ministry. Paul says, &#x93;many will give \n    thanks&#x85;for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many.&#x94; \n    There is an inseparable link between prayer and effective missions. </p>\n  <p>The \n    place God wants you in His missions program is something wonderful that you \n    must discover from Him. But it is His will that you, a child of God, pray \n    for world evangelization. We don&#x92;t dare sidestep this opportunity and responsibility. \n    Pray...&#x93;Pray without ceasing&#x94; 1 Thessalonians 5:17&#x85;&#x93;You should always pray \n    and not give up&#x94; Luke 18:1b.</p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/prayer2.htm\">next \n    page</a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n            \n</td>\n  </div><hr class=\"rdb-page-break\" /><div><td width=\"1\" height=\"185\" valign=\"top\"></td>\n    <td width=\"129\" height=\"185\" valign=\"top\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/index.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/mobilizerslogo.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"Missions Mobilizers logo\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n    <td width=\"478\" height=\"710\" rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\"> \n  <p><b>7 \n    Ways to Pray for Missions</b></p>\n  <p><b>1</b> \n    <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/prayer.htm\">Unleashing God's Power</a><b> </b><br>\n    <b>2</b> <b>Pray on Two Levels</b> <br>\n    <b>3</b> \n    <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/prayer3.htm\">Seven Ways to Pray</a><br>\n    <br>\n    <b>Page 2 &#x97; \n    Pray on Two Levels</b></p>\n  <p> \n    Here are two suggestions to help you pray more effectively: </p>\n  <p><b>Maintain \n    a broad general interest in the world</b><br>\n    Take the initiative to understand the varying needs throughout the world. \n    Keep up with current events in various countries, and pray for the needs of \n    different countries&#x97;some people pray for a different continent every \n    day of the week. </p>\n  <p><b>Pray \n    regularly for one missionary or a missionary family </b><br>\n    After you&#x92;ve cultivated your interest world-wide, narrow in and specialize \n    your concern in one particular outreach. Ask God to put one specific missionary \n    on your heart and commit yourself to that missionary in a deep, meaningful \n    way. As God leads you, make a definite commitment to Him to pray daily for \n    your partner in ministry. </p>\n  <p>Learn \n    all you can about your missionary: the family, the agency, the country where \n    he or she is serving, the type of work to be done, and the people he or she \n    is working with. </p>\n  <p>Other \n    ways to serve your missionary are to write, send small gifts occasionally, \n    or have them for dinner while on furlough. Be creative! Think about what would \n    lift you up if YOU were in the field. </p>\n  <p>Rejoice \n    with your missionary in his or her answers to prayer. Worship God with thanksgiving \n    for meeting your missionary&#x92;s needs. </p>\n  <p>It \n    is not easy to pray for someone every day for an extended period of time&#x97;no \n    matter how strong your commitment. So, also pray that God would help you to \n    be effective in His ministry of missions! </p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/prayer3.htm\">next \n    page</a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n            \n</td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Unleashing God's Power Through Prayer","rendered_pages":2,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/prayer.htm"}

Team members also joined a ministry-in-progress \n                  that teaches Christian ethics toEastern \n                  Europen \n                  school teachers. As a result of this work, more than 100 Eastern \n                  Europen \n                  Christians now attend weekly Bible studies. The team hopes to \n                  continue discipling and equipping Eastern \n                  Europen \n                  believers, so they can lead their own church-planting movement.</td>\n        </tr></table>\n      <p>Winter \n        has set in and our temperatures will range from -30 F, down to -40 and \n        all the way up to 32 F! And the sun, if it decides to show itself, rises \n        to only about 10 degrees above the horizon. On December 1, the sun rose \n        at 9:35 a.m. and set at 3:29 p.m. The long dark days tend to make everyone \n        a little more tired than usual. </p>\n      <p>The \n        humorous contrast is that when it is sunny during the winter, it is almost \n        always the coldest since the sky is clear and all the heat radiates outward \n        towards space. We have often joked that the North Star looks so much bigger \n        here, because we are so much closer to it. </p>\n      <p>Sometimes \n        when we go shopping at the outdoor markets in winter, our hands feel frozen \n        as we count out our money. Yet, our endurance is meager compared to the \n        women who are out all day selling goods in the coldest of weather. They \n        have no choice&#x97;they need to do it in order to survive. </p>\n      <p>In \n        contrast to the bleakness, the benefits of the winter here make up for \n        the cold and darkness. The snow can brighten and whiten the surroundings \n        at the same time, providing ideal conditions for cross-country skiing \n        or sledding. </p>\n      <p>People \n        also enjoy ice skating on the outdoor areas that are iced and cleaned \n        for that purpose. In addition, as the lakes freeze, many people head out \n        to do ice fishing as both a means of food and relaxation. </p>\n      <p><b>Spiritual \n        work keeps the team busy all winter</b> <br>\n        The winter is one of our busiest seasons with regard to Bible studies \n        and training. </p>\n      <p>We \n        tend to be heavily involved in different groups from October through April \n        or until &#x93;dacha&#x94; season starts. Dachas are the country retreats that many \n        families head to for vacations, and to work their gardens for the food \n        that helps them withstand the winter. </p>\n      <p>We \n        are helping a young community become spiritually established and self-sufficient. \n        </p>\n      <p>Although \n        it is still in the early stages of growth, in the last several months, \n        we have seen God working in the hearts of some of the men and women. They \n        are more excited to share God&#x92;s love with people who do not know about \n        Jesus Christ. </p>\n      <p>In \n        addition, people&#x92;s spiritual gifts are more evident as they step out in \n        faith and begin to love and serve others. </p>\n      <p>Please \n        pray that God will motivate workers and leaders to serve the community \n        and take responsibility for its growth. We teach several discipleship/ \n        advanced training groups, and hope these people will become disciples \n        of Christ and then teach others. </p>\n            <p><b>Team \n              seeks registration for future work </b><br>\n              Of late, we have been trying to help establish a Eastern \n              Europen \n              umbrella organization that will allow us to continue to work here \n              under a more open framework. New laws and restrictions in \n              Eastern Europe \n              continue to increase pressure on non-registered religious groups \n              and any foreigners who are doing religious activity. </p>\n      <p>It \n        is our understanding and hope that by establishing this organization, \n        we will provide coverage for the developing community and us. It may be \n        as early as January 1 that our community gathering is no longer allowed \n        to meet in the school where we get together. </p>\n            <p>This \n              pressure is coming as a result of the increased presence of many \n              cults and sects in Eastern \n              Europe, \n              the growth and the presence of non-denominational Protestant movements, \n              and increased opposition by the Orthodox Church. </p>\n      <p>At \n        this time, it is essentially illegal for non-registered religious groups \n        to hold Bible studies in public buildings, distribute literature, or practice \n        certain religious ceremonies like baptism. </p>\n      <p>The \n        law, however, is written so that it is very difficult to register. In \n        essence, you have to have existed for over 15 years, and to have your \n        roots in the pre-perestroika era in order to qualify for registration. \n        </p>\n      <p>It \n        isn&#x92;t exactly clear how a new group that wants to get registered would \n        be given the time to be established without external pressures. </p>\n      <p>Fortunately \n        for us, there exists the chance to be registered under a previously existing \n        organization that provides us with a certified, legal status of a religious \n        organization. </p>\n      <p>We \n        are praying that the registration process moves forward unhindered, and \n        that we will have this organization in place as soon as possible. </p>\n      <p>To \n        learn more about this team or how you can support them, e-mail<a href=\"mailto:mcquatem@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=N.%20Russia%20team%20support\"> \n        Melissa McQuate</a>. </p>\n      \n    </td>\n    </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Update from Northern Russia","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/news_nrussia.htm"}

It is a privilege to see with my own \n        eyes the fruit that is born from him. I never know when, how or by whom \n        intercession was made on Mulberry's behalf back here in the States, yet \n        I know that you are praying. Only the work of the Holy Spirit initiated \n        by prayer warriors on the home front can explain many of the things I \n        have witnessed. </p>\n      <p>Still, \n        I think I can point out a few benchmarks in Mulberry's spiritual maturity \n        and some factors that might have mobilized many to pray:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Spring \n          1996&#x97;Several newsletters were written, and a Xenos supporter came to \n          China for a visit. About eight months later, Mulberry became a believer.</li>\n        <li>Summer \n          1997&#x97;I returned to Columbus on home assignment and spoke about Mulberry. \n          A few months later, Mulberry was successfully grounded in the local \n          church.</li>\n        <li>Summer \n          1998&#x97;Several newsletters were written. A few months later, Mulberry \n          had led about five people at work to Christ and was conducting weekly \n          Bible studies with them.</li>\n        <li>Fall \n          1998&#x97;Another Xenos supporter visited China. Soon after this, I began \n          to lose count of the number of people Mulberry had led to the Lord. \n          </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>Now \n        after three years, Mulberry has accomplished more ministry with his own \n        people than I could have accomplished in a lifetime. But, the focus of \n        this writing is to encourage all of you involved in prayer for Mulberry \n        and for all missionary efforts. I think our shared ministry is similar \n        to Peter's and the praying church recorded in Acts 12:3-16. The church \n        prayed diligently in hope of results, while Peter witnessed God's response \n        to those prayers. May it continue to be this way as you and I continue \n        to co-labor, through Mulberry and many others, for God to grow His Church \n        in China.</p>\n      \n    </td>\n<td width=\"120\" valign=\"top\"></td>\n  \n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Passport: Prayer-Where the Real Battles Are Fought","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/passport_battle.htm"}

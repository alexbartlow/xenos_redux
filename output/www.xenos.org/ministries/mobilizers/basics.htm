An entire line of support personnel must stand behind them, \n    supplying whatever the combat troops need to do battle. And back on the home \n    front, massive mobilization is required to keep people aware of their part \n    in the war. Posters and radio programs, small-town parades and publicity campaigns \n    urge people to pray for their troops, to write to them to keep up their battle-fatigued \n    morale, to sacrifice luxuries for the sake of the war effort, to give up the \n    use of items that are more desperately needed on the front lines, to volunteer \n    for support positions from medical assistants to entertainers, to put their \n    personal money into special accounts such as \"war bonds\" so the proceeds can \n    be used for the war effort, to go to work at new jobs in order to produce \n    materials needed in the conflict. </p>\n  <p>Think \n    back over the items of this analogy and ask how you might motivate, train, \n    and activate people in your culture to such vital responses to a national \n    crisis. Those ideas are probably exactly how you can motivate, train, and \n    activate believers to their part in the global spiritual warfare against Satan's \n    false kingdom of darkness. To mobilize is to get them moving.  \n    </p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/basics2.htm\">next \n    page</a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n            \n</td>\n  </div><hr class=\"rdb-page-break\" /><div><td width=\"4\" height=\"186\" valign=\"top\"></td>\n    <td width=\"129\" height=\"186\" valign=\"top\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/index.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/mobilizerslogo.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"Missions Mobilizers logo\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n    <td width=\"478\" height=\"866\" rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\"> \n  <p><b>Mobilization \n    Basics <br>\n    </b></p>\n  <p><b>Page \n    2 &#x97; Characteristics of a Mobilizer</b></p>\n  <p> \n    What are the characteristics of a mobilizer? Consider a sample listing: </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Needs \n      to be able to be a servant.</li>\n    <li>Desires \n      to see laborers raised up to finish the task of world evangelization.</li>\n    <li>Possibly \n      has the gift of encouragement and exhortation.</li>\n    <li>Is \n      &#x93;apt to teach&#x94;&#x97;but may be more effective in recruiting others \n      to teach.</li>\n    <li>Speaks \n      in front of groups without (too much) fear.</li>\n    <li>Leads \n      others well&#x97;although he or she may not know it.</li>\n    <li>Has \n      a general heart for the world, possibly focusing in on one people group.</li>\n    <li>Sees \n      the priority of waiting and mobilizing others as well as going. </li>\n    <li>Is \n      part visionary&#x97;seeing what can happen as God matches empowered believers \n      with key opportunities of ministry.</li>\n    <li>Is \n      part implementer&#x97;driven to see visions become realities. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>The \n    first characteristic listed&#x97;having a servant heart&#x97;is critical. \n    Mobilizers must first win the right to be heard before being allowed to speak. \n    One mobilizer moved to a new town and joined a church because he felt it was \n    God's will. But he soon found that the pastor had a reputation of not allowing \n    individuals like himself to have significant opportunities for mobilizing. \n    Realizing this, the mobilizer went to the pastor with this question: &#x93;Pastor, \n    how can I serve you in this church?&#x94; Within a year, he had won the pastor's \n    heart and was free to mobilize in any way he saw fit. </p>\n  <p>Many \n    mission zealots unintentionally squelch mission interest with guilt-riddled \n    diatribes, or more and more impassioned pleas for money for a broken, dying \n    world. This can be dangerous. And the most dangerous zealot of all is &#x93;the \n    mobilizer with an attitude.&#x94; This is a sincere believer who thinks he \n    or she will motivate churches into broader vision by shaming them into action. \n    In fact, Larry Walker of ACMC has listed some characteristics of the mobilizer \n    with an attitude. </p>\n  <p>A \n    note to fanatic mission mobilizers: Notice that we're not saying that anyone \n    with a low commitment level to mission vision has no commitment or a low commitment \n    to Jesus Christ. Many solid believers who are, in their understanding of Scripture, \n    thoroughly committed to Christ may evidence very little mission commitment. \n    It's often a matter of not receiving clear teaching on God's heart for every \n    people group that results in low mission commitment. It's not that non-mission-minded \n    believers don't love Jesus as devoutly as mission fanatics.  \n    </p>\n            \n</td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Mobilization Basics","rendered_pages":2,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/basics.htm"}

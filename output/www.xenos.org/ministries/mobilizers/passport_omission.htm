I had just \n    described the state of world evangelism for a group of Urbana students. I \n    had relayed the fact that more than half the world&#x92;s people not only have \n    never heard the good news of life in Christ; they cannot hear because there \n    is no witnessing church among them. At the same time I had briefly outlined \n    the data on the pitifully few who had even attempted to reach those unreached. \n    </i></p>\n  <p><i>&#x93;</i>&#x91;How \n    come?&#x92; &#x91;How come,&#x92; what?<i>&#x94;</i> I asked. The voice from the back of \n    the auditorium rang out again, \"With so many unreached people, how come so \n    few are going?\" </p>\n  <p>Is \n    this a question you&#x92;ve asked yourself before? You&#x92;ll find the answer between \n    the pages of a slim, but powerful book called <i>The Great Omission</i>, by \n    Robertson McQuilkin. </p>\n  <p><b>Honest \n    Answers </b><br>\n    McQuilkin&#x92;s book is powerful not for its inspiration (although it is inspiring), \n    but because of its honesty. His straightforward and frank approach is refreshing \n    and useful to anyone interested in God&#x92;s view of people and the mission field. \n    </p>\n  <p><b>Concise \n    Answers </b><br>\n    If you want to know <b>a lot </b>about missions but only have a little bit \n    of time, read McQuilken&#x92;s <i>The Great Omission</i>. Prepare yourself to find \n    honest answers to all of your missions questions, such as: </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>What \n      does the Bible as a whole say about missions?</li>\n    <li>How \n      do you know if you&#x92;ve been called by God to be a missionary? </li>\n    <li>How \n      can you make your home church or small group more missions minded? </li>\n    <li>How \n      can you be an effective prayer warrior for missions? </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Whatever \n    your missions question, McQuilkin has a response. Robertson McQuilkin, former \n    President of Columbia International University, was a keynote speaker at the \n    1999 ACMC Missions Conference hosted by Xenos.</p>\n            \n  </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Book Review: The Great Omission","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/passport_omission.htm"}

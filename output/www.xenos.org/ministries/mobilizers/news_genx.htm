Mott said that&#x97;in 1901. Mott led the Student Volunteer Movement, launched \n        in 1886, which helped spur the &#x93;second wave&#x94; of modern missions: the spread \n        inland from coastal cities by missionaries searching out the lost. </p>\n      <p>Church \n        historian Kenneth Scott Latourette describes Mott as possessing &#x93;a simple \n        faith...a complete commitment to Christ ...(and) worldwide vision.&#x94; That \n        pretty well describes, too, many young people today spreading the gospel \n        among unreached peoples of The Last Frontier&#x97; the &#x93;third wave&#x94; of missions. \n        </p>\n      <p>The \n        Southern Baptist International Mission Board has a &#x93;whole crew of people \n        that are literally willing to die for their people group,&#x94; says Jim Riddell, \n        associate director of IMB mission personnel selection. &#x93;These are people \n        who have bought into this image of living on the edge, this goal of &#x91;all \n        peoples, nothing less,&#x92; and they want to do what it takes to reach their \n        people group. This is largely a Buster and Generation X group.&#x94; </p>\n      <p>&#x93;They&#x92;re \n        possibility thinkers,&#x94; says Lloyd Atkinson, IMB associate vice president \n        for mission personnel. &#x93;They honestly believe every people in the world \n        can be reached for Christ, and that this might be the last generation \n        of missionaries. They want to be a part of that. That&#x92;s why I don&#x92;t think \n        a lot of them are interested in just maintaining something someone else \n        started.&#x94; </p>\n      <p>Students \n        don&#x92;t just accept challenging assignments; they ask for them. &#x93;They say, \n        I want to go to a place where nobody else wants to serve, and I&#x92;m willing \n        to do what it takes for me to get there,&#x92;&#x94; explains Mike Lopez, IMB student \n        section chief. &#x93;For the most part, they raise their own money...&#x94; </p>\n      <p>Raised \n        in a tumultuous American society, comfortable with multiple cultures and \n        surfing the Internet, Xers &#x93;can live with chaos,&#x94; observes David Garrison, \n        IMB strategy and mobilization leader and a pioneer in targeting unreached \n        peoples. And more and more of them come to the task well-informed about \n        the thousands of ethnic-linguistic peoples untouched by the gospel. </p>\n      <p>Xers \n        with a taste of The Last Frontier like to sit up all night trading stories \n        about how close they came to the edge while sharing the gospel. They go \n        into unreached villages, make friends quickly and share their faith&#x97; and \n        sometimes get pulled into police stations for questioning or sent packing. \n        </p>\n      <p>&#x93;We \n        used to see that as a sign of failure,&#x94; Garrison says. &#x93;They see it as \n        a sign of success.&#x94; </p>\n      <p>Not \n        too many years ago, Garrison found little interest in unreached peoples \n        when he talked to students on college and seminary campuses. Now, he says, \n        they seek him out and declare, &#x93;I want my life to make a difference. I \n        want a cause worth dying for.&#x94; </p>\n      \n    </td>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Gen Xers in the Last Frontier","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/news_genx.htm"}

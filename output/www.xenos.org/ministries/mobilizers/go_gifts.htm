A growing disciple, maturing in likeness to Christ and \n        leading others to be the same, is an essential characteristic of a missionary.</p>\n      <p>\"One cannot follow Jesus and become like Him and not make disciples. \n        This is the most basic characteristic and role of a missionary and his \n        supreme task--disciple making.</p>\n      <p>\"The Holy Spirit is the power dynamic for all christian living and \n        serving. (Eph 3:14-19; 5:18)</p>\n      <p>Murray: \"The one thing needful for the church...is to be filled \n        with the Spirit of God...without being filled with the Spirit, it is utterly \n        impossible that an individual christian or a church can ever live or work \n        as God desires\".</p>\n      <p>\"Every believer is under command to make sure of the fullness of \n        God in her of his life before going into service. Fruit that will abide \n        must be born by the life-giving Spirit. The power to move people is a \n        power given by God.</p>\n      <p>A.T. Pierson: \"Be assured, the greatest lack of missions, both at \n        home and abroad is the <i>want</i>of this anointing\"</p>\n      <p>\"The gifting of the body of Christ for ministry is the strategy \n        of the Father for mobilizing the entire family for useful kingdom service. \n        This is especially true for the missionary. Missionaries must have discovered \n        their gifts, enhanced them by study and faithful use, and made these gifts \n        forever available to their Lord\".</p>\n      <p>\"The missionary gift, Peter Wagner maintains, 'is the special ability \n        that God gives to certain members of the Body of Christ, to minister whatever \n        other gifts they may have in a second culture. It is the specific gift \n        of cross cultural ministry.' This is what makes the missionary call and \n        gift unique. It is victoriously enabling for the sent one to have this \n        divine presence and power\".</p>\n      <h3><b>4.

A high view of scripture \n        as the specific revelation of God to all people everywhere is required. \n        Every missionary should do the work of an evangelist. Let the love of \n        Christ mold you into being an effective communicator of this most vital \n        of all messages. 2 Cor 4:1-7, 5:9-21</p>\n      <h3><b>5.

The effective missionary seeks \n        to maintain a lifestyle that fits into his host culture. Try to live so \n        your lifestyle does not call undue attention to itself. The specific context, \n        as well as your purpose for being there will help you make lifestyle decisions. \n        To a degree you will always be a foreigner, but you should seek a lifestyle \n        that 'fits'. This type of cultural adaptation will help people see your \n        Jesus and not your accumulation of things.</p>\n      <p>Bishop Stephen Neill:&#xA0; \"We want missionaries who will lay their \n        bones here.&#xA0; 1. the missionaries should be the servants of the church, \n        not it's boss; 2. they should identify with the church and the people \n        whom she or he serves; 3. they should have no doubt as to the purpose \n        for which they have come; 4. they should be persons in whom we can see \n        Jesus. </p>\n      \n      <h3>6.

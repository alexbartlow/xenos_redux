Beginning with its \n    origins in 1923 in northwest Cambodia among the hard-working rice farmers, \n    the Church suffered through decades of opposition and stagnation. Then came \n    the unimaginable 70s with an unimaginable spiritual harvest. </p>\n  <p>The \n    genocidal reign of the Khmer Rouge followed this time of spiritual prosperity. \n    Murderous actions claimed the lives of up to one-third of the entire Cambodian \n    population, and ninety percent of the Church. Only recently has Cambodia begun \n    to experience a steady rebuilding of her church. </p>\n  <p>Now \n    we must ask, &#x93;What we can do today?&#x94; </p>\n  <p>The \n    history of the Cambodian church is disturbing, but the visible hand of God \n    at work within its members is redeeming. The author relies on heart-wrenching \n    testimonies of surviving Cambodian Christians, making <i>Killing Fields, Living \n    Fields</i> one of the most compelling books you will ever read. </p>\n  <p>This \n    book is a must for anyone interested in learning about missions in Cambodia, \n    and for anyone desiring an increased compassion for God's suffering people \n    in the world. </p>\n  <p><b>Resources \n    on Cambodia: </b><br>\n    <i>Killing Fields, Living Fields</i> by Don Cormack<br>\n    <i>Children of Cambodia's Killing Fields</i> by Dith Pran <br>\n    <i>A History of Cambodia</i> by David P.

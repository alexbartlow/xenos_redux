It will also serve to define the overall process \n    and related responsibilities of Xenos Christian Fellowship, mission field \n    leaders, trip leaders, and team members. </p>\n  <p>Short-term mission \n    trips are a proven tool for mobilizing the Church towards greater involvement \n    in missions. The Xenos Missions Department has two primary objectives, which \n    a strategic short-term mission trip initiative would help to accomplish. The \n    first objective is to enlist 50% of all Home Church members as a &#x93;Missions \n    Mobilizer.&#x94; A Missions Mobilizer is someone who seeks to increase missions \n    awareness and involvement in their life and Church, as evidenced by an annual \n    commitment to various missions-related activities. The second objective is \n    to identify and develop long-term missionaries. Many factors can impact the \n    effectiveness of this tool in mobilizing the Church; therefore, a strategy \n    for short-term mission trips has been defined, as well as guidelines for how \n    the trips should be managed. </p>\n  <p><b>The primary \n    strategy of Xenos Christian Fellowship is to send out short-term teams to \n    mission fields where Xenos has already invested, or plans to invest, in long-term \n    fields.</b> We feel the benefits to this strategy are numerous. As a church \n    mobilization tool, short-term members often make a strong connection with \n    the country and people they have personally seen and met, and therefore become \n    more effective prayer and financial supporters of our long-term mission fields. \n    They may develop enough of a heart for missions that they would consider preparing \n    to join one of our fields as a long-term worker. The larger congregation is \n    mobilized indirectly by the enthusiasm of the team, as well as the spiritual \n    impacts made on both the team members and the nationals that our long-term \n    team is striving to reach. </p>\n  <p>Proper planning, \n    team building, and training can also reap benefits to the missionaries and \n    nationals of our long-term fields. In addition to those realized by a more \n    mobilized sending church, benefits include: </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Completion \n      of short-term projects that they have not had the resources to complete. \n      </li>\n    <li>Effective \n      witness for Christ demonstrated through active faith. </li>\n    <li>Affirmation \n      of our commitment to the mission and a kindling of the connection with their \n      sending church.</li>\n    <li>Encouragement \n      of long-term workers by coming alongside them in a very tangible way. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>In short, a sound \n    short-term investment of our resources is one that also serves to advance \n    our long-term objectives. </p>\n  <p>This is not meant \n    to discount the impact of trips taken by church members that are not in line \n    with the strategy. Certainly, any cross-cultural exposure will provide a heightened \n    awareness of the many emotional, physical, and spiritual needs that exist \n    in the world, and thus serve to mobilize the church towards increased involvement \n    in missions. A clearly defined strategy simply promotes a proactive rather \n    than reactive management of short-term trips, and consistency in the prioritization \n    of proposals. Trips that are considered strategic in nature and approved by \n    the Management Team and Elders have been termed, &#x93;Xenos-sponsored;&#x94; \n    those that aren't have been termed, &#x93;well-wisher.&#x94;</p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/stpolicies2.htm\">next \n    page</a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n            \n</td>\n  </div><hr class=\"rdb-page-break\" /><div><td width=\"1\" height=\"185\" valign=\"top\"></td>\n    <td width=\"129\" height=\"185\" valign=\"top\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/index.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/mobilizerslogo.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"Missions Mobilizers logo\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n    <td width=\"478\" height=\"515\" rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\"> \n  <p><b>Short-term \n    Mission Trips within Xenos Christian Fellowship</b></p>\n  <p><b>Page \n    2&#x97;Sponsorship</b></p>\n  <p>Xenos Elders \n    and Management Team have determined that there is a limit to the number of \n    short-term trips that can be sponsored by the Church. This has resulted from \n    a limited supply of resources. Depending on the objectives of each trip, a \n    very small or very large amount of people, time and money may be necessary. \n    The Church is called to be a faithful steward of the resources God has provided, \n    and it must therefore, seriously consider the extent to which it can commit \n    to supplying these resources. The outcome of this decision may change from \n    year-to-year as it is affected by various factors such as ministry emphasis, \n    the number of long-term missionaries being sent to the field, and financial \n    or other shifting priorities recognized by Xenos Christian Fellowship. </p>\n  <p>The benefits \n    of sponsorship are, to the extent necessary for each team, assistance with \n    development of ministry objectives, trip coordination, communication with \n    the field, tax-exempt status, and accounting support. Benefits also include \n    the ability of the team to promote fundraising activities within the Church.</p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/stpolicies3.htm\">next \n    page</a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n            \n</td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Short-term Mission Trips within Xenos - Strategy","rendered_pages":2,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/stpolicies.htm"}

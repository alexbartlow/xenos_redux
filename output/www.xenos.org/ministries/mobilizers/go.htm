Here's an overview of how XCF can help you to determine \n        if this is God's plan for your life. The leadership of XCF wants to help \n        you become a strong disciple for Christ, whether it is on one of our priority \n        fields or living here in the States. </p>\n      <p>We have developed a plan that will lead interested people through a growth \n        process to help them be prepared to serve as missionaries. It covers areas \n        of your personal spiritual walk with Christ, healthy relationships, ministry \n        experience, character development and other physical and emotional characteristics. \n      </p>\n      <p>Whether you live overseas or in Columbus, much of basic christian living \n        is the same. Understanding and using your spiritual gifts, being filled \n        with the Spirit, exhibiting the fruit of the Spirit, displaying a servant \n        heart, submission to authority, personal Bible study, acts of kindness \n        and compassion; all of these are part of the normal christian life. </p>\n      <p>That being the case, anyone who begins the preparation process for serving \n        as a missionary, but then senses God's leading in a different direction, \n        will still benefit greatly from the discipling activities of this plan. \n        You will be a stronger christian to serve God here in the States. Remember: \n        \"Where you think you are going when you start out is very seldom \n        where you wind up\". </p>\n      <p>The preparation process takes interested people through 5 phases of:</p>\n      <p>1. Preliminary interest<br>\n        2. Exploration<br>\n        3. Preparation<br>\n        4. Assessment<br>\n        5.

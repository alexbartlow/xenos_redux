Recognizing that missionary life calls for special qualities which \n        will be uniquely tested, a committee of Christian care-givers and mission \n        personnel has identified and described behaviorally the following qualities \n        of a hardy personality, positive traits that will enable the cross cultural \n        worker to serve God joyfully and be productive under difficult situations; \n        i.e. to retain and maintain emotional, physical and spiritual health. \n      </p>\n      <p>Lack of any of these traits is an indicator that growth is needed, not \n        a cause for guilt or shame. The greatest missionary of all acknowledged \n        his weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9-10), and his sinfulness (1 Timothy 1:15-16) \n        but endured crushing experiences (2 Corinthians 4:7-10; 2 Corinthians \n        11:23-28) and drew his strength from Christ (Phil. 4:12-13). So may we. \n      </p>\n      <p>The reason for describing these qualities behaviorally rather than accepting \n        the candidate's statement of their presence is that the behavioral manifestation \n        is likely to be more accurate than the verbal claim. </p>\n      <p>The members of the committee are deeply committed to God's standards, \n        and the utilization of His resources. While it is possible for a non-Christian \n        to be emotionally hardy, the godly person brings to all of life an acknowledgment \n        of personal inadequacy and of God's sufficiency, and a compassionate awareness \n        of human frailty in self and others. So for the godly person, hardiness \n        does not replace dependence on God, or do away with a sense of weakness. \n        All glory belongs &#x93;&#x85;to him who is able to keep you from falling and \n        to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great \n        joy&#x85;&#x94; (Jude 24). </p>\n      <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/go_behavior.htm\">Behaviors</a>&#xBB; \n        </b></p>\n       \n      \n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/go.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/graphics/gosmall.gif\" width=\"120\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Missions Prefield Training Manual\"></a> \n      </p>\n      \n       \n      <div><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/index.htm\">Home</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/aware.htm\">Awareness</a> l <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/involve.htm\">Involvement</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/join.htm\">Join</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/passport.htm\">Passport</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/calendar.htm\">Calendar</a> \n        <br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/missions.htm\">Missions \n        Dept</a></div>\n    </td>\n  \n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Hardy Personality","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/go_hardy.htm"}

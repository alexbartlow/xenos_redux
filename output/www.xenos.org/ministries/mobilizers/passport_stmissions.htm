For about the past \n    15 years the Church has employed the strategy of intensive two-week, two-month \n    and two-year overseas missions teams to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ \n    to more than 1.3 billion unevangelized persons in the world. </p>\n  <p>Sounds \n    exciting, doesn&#x92;t it? Still, an important question arises: Are short-term \n    trips effective? Does the time and money funneled into these teams contribute \n    to the Biblical mandate of evangelizing the world? </p>\n  <p>Unfortunately, \n    limited research is availabe to help find the answer. However, according to \n    an interesting study done in 1991 by STEM (Short-Term Evangelical Missions), \n    substantial changes took place in the perceptions and behavior of their short-term \n    participants as a result of the participant's experience. These changes include:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>higher \n      commitment level to world missions</li>\n    <li>longer \n      and more focused prayer for missions</li>\n    <li>increased \n      monthly financial giving to missions</li>\n    <li>increased \n      involvement in mission-related activities and education</li>\n    <li>increased \n      desire to return to the mission field. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>All \n    of these changes are likely to contribute to world evangelization. As STEM \n    concludes, &#x93;A well-planned short-term mission experience is an effective \n    strategy available to the Church for developing and unleashing potential human \n    and material resources to complete the Great Commission.&#x94;</p>\n            \n  </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Book Review: The Great Omission","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/passport_stmissions.htm"}

Unfortunately the staff and board are ill equipped \n    to fulfill this responsibility. It is important to see why pastors are not \n    naturally equipped to fulfill this role and to understand what can be done \n    to help expand their mission vision. </p>\n  <p>Carl \n    Palmer, senior pastor at Cedar Mills Bible Church in Portland, Oregon, has \n    helped me to understand the difficulties pastors face in this area. Palmer \n    was the mission pastor at Los Gatos Christian Church and therefore is in a \n    unique position to help us understand pastors. Palmer says that pastors are \n    primarily shepherds and are overwhelmed by local needs. Furthermore they lack \n    training and confidence in missions. They lack the support of the mission \n    team. Unless you have been a pastor, you do not understand the pressures placed \n    on pastors by the multiple interest groups, each with their own pressing agendas. \n    </p>\n  <p>Palmer \n    suggests the following ten practical steps to correct this situation over \n    the long haul: </p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Define \n      a realistic and balanced picture of pastoral commitment to missions (don't \n      overstate the case). </li>\n    <li>Explain \n      how missions can be a blessing to the congregation. </li>\n    <li>Establish \n      confidence in the effectiveness of the mission program. </li>\n    <li>Develop \n      a 5-7 year plan for missions in the church (try to be patient). </li>\n    <li>Pray \n      for the pastor, not just his mission vision or lack of it. </li>\n    <li>Plan \n      to influence him through submitting to him. </li>\n    <li>Give \n      him scholarships from the mission budget to key mission events. </li>\n    <li>Send \n      the pastor and his wife to the mission field frequently (from the mission \n      budget). </li>\n    <li>Pass \n      on to him key books and mission resources (sermon helps, etc.). </li>\n    <li>Involve \n      the pastor in mission decisions, even if he isn't particularly interested. \n      </li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>It \n    is critical to understand the difficulties pastors face and to become a positive \n    influence and help for missions.  \n    </p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/dynamics8.htm\">next \n    page</a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n  \n</td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Seven Dynamics - Leadership","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/dynamics7.htm"}

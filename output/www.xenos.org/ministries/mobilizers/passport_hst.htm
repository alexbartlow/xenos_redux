As missionaries prepare \n    to go on the field and enter into a new realm of service, they rely heavily \n    on the body for administrative as well as spiritual support at home and abroad. \n    </p>\n  <img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/graphics/tiawanhmgrp.jpg\" width=\"220\"> \n  <p>The \n    Taiwan Team&#x97;Robb and Holly Branch, Tim and Jennifer McCracken, and Seann \n    and Amy Gibson&#x97;have been encouraged by the response they have received \n    as they assemble their Home Support Team (HST). </p>\n  <p><b>Comments \n    from the Team </b><br>\n    In the midst of a busy schedule raising support, Tim McCracken notes, &#x93;It \n    has been very exciting for us to get out and about. Seeing people interested \n    in Taiwan and missions is very encouraging to us. We pray that God will continue \n    to bring people forward that want to take a stand with us for God&#x92;s burden \n    for Taiwan.&#x94; </p>\n  <p>Robb \n    Branch explains his vision for the HST, &#x93;The HST provides a foundation \n    of support that allows us to focus and invest in the mission work to which \n    God has called us. Knowing there are committed and godly people supporting \n    us back home motivates us to continue the work. </p>\n  <p>The \n    HST is also very vital as it keeps the mission alive by making a lot of noise \n    back home to keep prayers and thoughts directed at the Taiwan Team.&#x94; \n    </p>\n  <p><b>Prayer \n    </b><br>\n    Prayer is an essential element for the success of the Taiwan Team. Each missionary \n    couple would like to have 200 prayer supporters. &#x93;Spiritual warfare is \n    what prayer is about,&#x94; says Greg Roth, coordinator of the monthly prayer \n    meeting. </p>\n  <p>Roth \n    would like to see a mix of people from the supporting churches develop into \n    a core group of faithful prayer warriors at the meeting. Since some of the \n    missionaries attend the prayer meeting, it&#x92;s a good time to get to know them \n    and share their burden. </p>\n  <p>Since \n    the missionaries left in spring 2000, the meeting serves as a tool to keep \n    people abreast of current information as well as motivate and encourage prayer \n    throughout the month. </p>\n  <p><b>Keeping \n    in Touch </b><br>\n    Another means to disseminate information is the bimonthly prayer newsletter \n    for each individual couple. Lisa Beech, who organizes the letter for the Gibsons \n    says, &#x93;The letter is intended to keep people updated of the needs of \n    the couple at home and abroad.&#x94; </p>\n  <p>If \n    people are closely in touch with what is happening they will feel a part of \n    this ministry and understand more deeply the role they can play supporting \n    the missionaries. </p>\n  <p>Andrea \n    Wei, a personal administrator for Robb and Holly Branch, experienced this \n    first hand. &#x93;After listening to their presentation I was struck by their \n    vision and burden for the Taiwanese people. This interaction has deepened \n    my desire to be involved in mission work.&#x94; </p>\n  <p>Participation \n    in the HST offers a great opportunity for people to be involved in the mission \n    from home. &#x93;I look forward to hearing about the fruit of this mission \n    field and to see my role unfold,&#x94; says Dan Conklin, a personal administrator \n    for the McCrackens. &#x93;I&#x92;m very glad to be a part of the team as our actions \n    will have direct impact on the world.&#x94; </p>\n  <p>Home \n    Support Team roles are numerous and vary in time commitment. Every role is \n    vital.<b> \n    </b></p>\n            \n  </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/graphics/tiawanhmgrp.jpg","title":"Passport: Building a Home Support Team - Taiwan","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/passport_hst.htm"}

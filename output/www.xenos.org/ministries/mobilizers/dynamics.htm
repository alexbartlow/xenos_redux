Those agencies and churches that have been \n    most successful in the past are at greatest risk. Their past successes may \n    have blinded them to the changing shifts in missions. Frontier missions is \n    at particular risk. We are facing the most difficult challenge to reach the \n    unreached peoples, especially those located in the 10/40 window, just as the \n    influence of missions in North America is declining. The methods and techniques \n    that fueled the tremendous post-World-War-II missions mobilization effort \n    are ineffective when used with contemporary audiences. If the North American \n    mission industry is to continue to play a key role in reaching the unreached, \n    we must change or die! </p>\n  <p>For \n    more than twenty years I have wrestled with the issue of how to get contemporary \n    American Christians involved in God's global cause. Gene Getz was an important \n    mentor during my seminary years. At Fellowship Bible Church in Dallas, I experienced \n    a church that excelled at relating Christianity to contemporary America. As \n    a mission pastor at that same church, I was able to experience the failures \n    and successes of involving a boomer congregation in missions. Now as a mission \n    consultant with ACMC, I have been exposed to some of the best mission churches. \n    </p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/dynamics2.htm\">next \n    page</a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n  \n</td>\n  </div><hr class=\"rdb-page-break\" /><div><td width=\"1\" height=\"186\" valign=\"top\"></td>\n    <td width=\"129\" height=\"186\" valign=\"top\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/index.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/mobilizerslogo.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"Missions Mobilizers logo\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n    <td width=\"478\" height=\"1040\" rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\"> \n  <p><b>Seven \n    Dynamics for Advancing <br>\n    Your Church in Missions<br>\n    </b><br>\n    <b>Page 2 &#x97; Four Major Obstacles</b></p>\n  <p> \n    In this article I would like to describe four major obstacles to missions \n    that the North American mission community is not adequately resolving. Then \n    I would like to describe seven dynamics that I believe will help any church \n    advance in missions. </p>\n  <p>Professor \n    Howard Hendricks on one occasion said that &#x93;A problem well defined is \n    a problem half solved.&#x94; I would like to describe four obstacles to advancing \n    churches in missions. I will then describe how the seven dynamics help to \n    overcome those obstacles. These are not the only obstacles to missions, but \n    from my perspective they are the major contenders. </p>\n  <p>The \n    first obstacle to advancing churches in missions is the common perception \n    that mission is peripheral to Christianity. From pastors in the pulpit to \n    Christians in the pew, most perceive missions to be the domain of super saints, \n    hyperactive Christians or maybe for those who are just a little weird. The \n    dynamics that follow describe how to demonstrate the centrality of missions \n    to our faith and how to relate world missions to &#x93;normal folks&#x94; \n    in the pew. </p>\n  <p>The \n    second obstacle is the ineffectiveness of mission leaders and enthusiasts \n    in relating missions to contemporary audiences. We have met the enemy, and \n    he is us! Some mission leaders have been so much a part of the mission community \n    and for so long that they have become inept at communicating missions effectively \n    to the non-involved. The dynamics that I will discuss help mission enthusiasts \n    and leaders to analyze their audience and develop methods and techniques that \n    relate to where people are. </p>\n  <p>The \n    third obstacle to advancing missions in churches is the nature of pastoral \n    ministry which tends to focus on local needs. The spiritual gift of pastor-teacher \n    does not naturally lend itself toward global issues. Pastors by training and \n    experience are generally ill equipped to lead their church in world missions. \n    In this article we will look at missions in the local church from the viewpoint \n    of the senior pastor and the crucial leadership role he plays and what can \n    be done in mobilizing churches for world missions. </p>\n  <p>The \n    fourth obstacle to advancing churches in missions is the influence of the \n    North American culture on the evangelical church. Materialism, pluralism, \n    individualism, existentialism, hedonism, etc...are major obstacles to getting \n    North American Christians involved in missions. The seven dynamics that follow \n    describes how to raise up counter-cultural &#x93;world Christians&#x94; who \n    will attract others to a Christian life-style focused on reaching the world. \n    </p>\n  <p>God's \n    purpose and plan for mankind will always be spearheaded by visionary leadership. \n    Although Abraham, Moses, Nehemiah and the apostle Paul had very different \n    personalities and backgrounds, yet all had one thing in common: each had received \n    a compelling vision from God of what He wanted them to do. The dynamics that \n    follow are antidotes to the obstacles for advancing God's mission in today's \n    world.  \n    </p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/dynamics3.htm\">next \n    page</a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n  \n  </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Seven Dyanmics for Advancing Your Church in Missions","rendered_pages":2,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/dynamics.htm"}

Whether you're just investigating global missions or you \n    are already involved, <i>Run With the Vision</i>, by Bob Sjogren, and Bill \n    and Amy Stearns, answers many questions people ask, including: </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>How \n      do I get involved in God's 'world plan' when I'm here in the United States? \n      </li>\n    <li>Will \n      a short-term mission trip help prepare me for long-term mission work? </li>\n    <li>Can \n      God use trials in my life to help me relate better to a particular people \n      group? </li>\n    <li>What \n      questions may a mission agency ask to determine who to accept on its team? \n      </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>This \n    280-page book serves as a relatively current reference with global statistics \n    as recent as 1995. Geographical information is easy to digest, because the \n    authors intertwine them with real-life news and missionary anecdotes about \n    unreached people groups. Many of the 12 chapters also include topical references, \n    related readings and video suggestions for researching more information. </p>\n  <p>Bonus! \n    <i>Run With the Vision</i> is available at area Christian bookstores and comes \n    in paperback, so it's both within reach and an affordable investment. </p>\n  <p>FYI: \n    Bob Sjogren challenged students in the 1998 Perspectives class and was a keynote \n    speaker spring of 1999 at the ACMC National Conference in San Diego, California. \n    </p>\n            \n  </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Book Review: The Great Omission","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/passport_runvision.htm"}

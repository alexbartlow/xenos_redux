What are we trying to accomplish? In order to provide a helpful \n    answer to this question, I've been working on a model for mobilization. This \n    isn't brand new; it's derived from other paradigms for persuasion and communication. \n    First, let's clarify the objective of mobilization. The result of mobilization \n    is not, as some might imagine, being &#x93;mobilized,&#x94; whatever that \n    means. The result of mobilization is resources for world evangelization. The \n    primary resources needed to see the Church established in every people group \n    are prayer for God's power and blessing, workers for the harvest and the financial/material \n    resources necessary to carry on the ministry. So in visualizing the work of \n    mobilizers, on one end of the model we see individuals and churches involved \n    in providing key resources for the harvest: prayer, people and funding. At \n    the other end of the model we begin with people who are not yet aware of world \n    evangelization. At this stage, our model looks like this: </p>\n  <p><b>Unaware..........................................Involved<br>\n    </b>.......................................................Prayer \n    <br>\n    .......................................................People \n    <br>\n    .......................................................Resources \n    </p>\n  <p>The \n    three intervening stages of the model include making people aware of world \n    evangelization, attracting their interest and awakening their concern. The \n    figure below shows how these elements relate to the model. </p>\n            <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/graphics/missions_6stagemodel.gif\" width=\"450\"></p>\n  <p>One \n    thing to note at this point is that the model makes a &#x93;cone&#x94; shape \n    - with the widest part at the beginning and the narrow part at the end of \n    the mobilization process. This illustrates the realization that at each step \n    of the process there will be those who do not move on to the next stage, but \n    rather move out of the mobilization process for a variety of reasons. This \n    figure demonstrates some of those reasons. </p>\n            <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/graphics/missions_6stagemodel2.gif\" width=\"450\"> \n              </p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/6stage2.htm\">next \n    page</a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n            \n</td>\n  </div><hr class=\"rdb-page-break\" /><div><td width=\"4\" height=\"186\" valign=\"top\"></td>\n    <td width=\"129\" height=\"186\" valign=\"top\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/index.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/mobilizerslogo.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"Missions Mobilizers logo\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n    <td width=\"478\" height=\"1057\" rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\"> \n  <p><b>Six-Stage \n    Mobilization Model<br>\n    </b><br>\n    <b>Page 2&#x97;Moving Along</b></p>\n  <p> \n    The skilled mobilizer will seek to give people good reasons to move along \n    towards involvement, rather than \"escape\" from the cone through ignorance, \n    apathy, distraction or frustration. </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><b>Moving \n      from Unaware to Aware</b> requires capturing attention. This means some \n      kind of personal contact or visual tools such as videos, brochures, etc. \n      </li>\n    <li><b>Moving \n      from Aware to Interested</b> requires identifying with a felt need or appealing \n      to a personal value. Common means of doing this include Bible messages or \n      applications which feature God's heart for all peoples. </li>\n    <li><b>Moving \n      from Interested to Concerned</b> requires introduction of a personal dimension \n      to increase desire for involvement. This means getting people involved emotionally, \n      but it doesn't mean telling only sad stories or \"laying a guilt trip\" on \n      people. The root of the word emotion is motion. Emotion is what gets us \n      into action. </li>\n    <li><b>Moving \n      from Concerned to Involved</b> requires a specific opportunity to act. It \n      is not enough to urge people to pray, give or go - we usually must provide \n      the means (request, time, place, address, account number, flight number, \n      etc.) to do these things. Many people end up frustrated because they want \n      to be involved, but don't have the specific opportunity or information at \n      the point they are motivated to act. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Another \n    dimension of the model introduces the aspect of scope. There are at least \n    three levels at which an individual can be involved in world evangelization: \n    the global/universal, the organizational and the personal/individual. We could \n    display these levels on the model as indicated in the figure at the top of \n    the next page. </p>\n            <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/graphics/missions_6stagemodel3.gif\" width=\"450\"> \n              </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>The \n      global/universal dimension focus on God's heart of love for all peoples, \n      his strategy to establish the Church of Jesus Christ within each group and \n      His mandate to us to disciple all the nations. </li>\n    <li>The \n      organizational dimension focuses on the specific aspect of God's work in \n      the world that is being carried on in a particular congregation or through \n      a particular mission agency or organization. </li>\n    <li>The \n      personal/individual dimension focuses on the ministry of workers or families \n      who are planting churches, evangelizing or discipling other believers.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/6stage2.htm\">next \n    page</a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n            \n  \n</td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Six-Stage Mobilization Model","rendered_pages":2,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/6stage.htm"}

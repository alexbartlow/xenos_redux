First of all, what does &#x93;mobilization&#x94; \n    refer to? Essentially mobilization refers to any process by which God's people \n    are awakened and kept moving and growing until they find their place for strategic \n    involvement in the task of completing world evangelization. Key words in this \n    sentence help us focus on what we are about as mobilizers. </p>\n  <p><b>&#x93;Awakened&#x94;</b><br>\n    A \n    new discovery or revelation which shakes a person or fellowship into awareness \n    and activity. </p>\n  <p><b>&#x93;Kept \n    moving and growing&#x94; </b><br>\n    This brings in the realities of discipleship and on-going care, the process \n    of seeing people develop their World Christian convictions and work them out \n    into practical areas of obedience. </p>\n  <p><b>&#x93;until...strategic \n    involvement&#x94; </b><br>\n    The most demanding word in this sentence is &#x93;until.&#x94; It requires \n    sticking with someone or some fellowship group until that individual or group \n    obtains a solid enough understanding of the task of world evangelization so \n    that it results in their taking specific steps that will have a strategic \n    impact on the overall cause of the Christian mission.</p>\n  <p> \n    <b>&#x93;finds their place&#x94;</b> <br>\n    Mission mobilizers are not concerned whether someone goes or stays. The key \n    issue is that those being mobilized are wrapped into a &#x93;first love&#x94; \n    for Jesus and His global concern. There is a major gap between the church \n    and the world to be reached. Between these two things are the forces in the \n    overall process of mobilization.  \n     \n     \n    </p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/process3.htm\">next \n    page</a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n            \n</td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"What Is Mobilization?","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/process2.htm"}

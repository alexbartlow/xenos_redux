He affirms repeatedly \n        that in Christ we find the strength, wisdom, and purpose we need for life. \n        Those responsible for the training of missionaries are obligated to ensure \n        that their training program facilitates the process of being conformed \n        to Christ and of discovering His adequacy for the challenges of life. \n        Spiritual maturity is the key to perseverance and effectiveness in christian \n        ministry.&#x94;</p>\n      \n      <h3>1.

These areas are of vital \n        importance for 'long-haul' workers.</p>\n      <p><b>Sense \n        of calling</b><br>\n        &#x93;Wherever you go, you must know that the living God has sent you. \n        If you get to the mission field via personal choice or to 'meet needs', \n        or a variety of other possible motivations, it is highly probable that \n        you will leave the same way or when the needs or social conditions change. \n        How stabilizing to know that you have been 'called by the will of God'.</p>\n      <p>&#x93;The missionary call is different from the call every believer has. \n        It carries the idea of being sent.&#x93;The missionary call has within \n        it the enabling ability to learn, to adjust to, and to be at home in and \n        effective in another culture.&#x94; </p>\n      <p>Kane: to receive and respond to this call requires an open mind, an attentive \n        ear, a clean heart and an available body.</p>\n      <p>Calling does not refer to a subjective experience. If God is calling \n        you, it will be affirmed by others.&#xA0;In the interview process, we \n        will be talking with your Home Group leader and others who can speak to \n        the area of 'calling'.</p>\n      <p><b>Regularly \n        practices means of growth</b></p>\n      <p><b>Bible&#x97;hermeneutics</b><br>\n        Christian workers and especially missionaries need to be able to feed \n        themselves in the Word. Without the benefit of fellowship, classes, and \n        body life, the spiritual life of the missionary could be compromised.&#xA0; \n        (From Curt's letter) \"Members and candidates should be spiritually \n        self sustaining. They should exhibit an ability to take care of themselves \n        spiritually and not need to be discipled in basic Christian growth. This \n        means that they are committed to personal Bible Study, prayer, serving \n        others fellowship and receiving discipline. It is also important that \n        candidates have had experience in searching out God's will for their lives \n        and ministry.</p>\n      <h3>&#xA0;2. <b>Healthy&#xA0; Relationships</b></h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li> committed to local church</li>\n        <li> marriage</li>\n        <li> kids/parents</li>\n        <li> friendly</li>\n        <li> willing to forgive</li>\n        <li> shows evidence of ability to work harmoniously with others in service \n          &amp; ministry&#x97;team building</li>\n        <li> conflict resolution</li>\n        <li> active listener</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p><b>Marriage</b><br>\n        \"Family growth is the core of team growth.

The consequence of these conflicts can be external, degrading \n        the quality of personal relationships, or it can be internal producing \n        psychological and other emotional and spiritual symptoms. Many of these \n        symptoms are coping strategies to help the person adjust to the developing \n        problems on the outside\"</p>\n      <p>\"If we desire to join with Jesus in what He is doing, then we must \n        place priority on building the church.</p>\n      <p> <b>Active \n        listener</b><br>\n        From <i>Too Valuable to Lose</i> p. 220: To move into a cross-cultural \n        environment requires a significant level of social flexibility.

Ministry Experience</h3>\n      <ul>\n         \n        <li> servant leadership</li>\n        <li> team work</li>\n        <li> able to communicate</li>\n        <li> discipleship</li>\n        <li> gifts</li>\n         \n      </ul>\n      <p><b>Ministry \n        Experience</b><br>\n        (From Val Hayworth/Elmbrook) &#x93;I view ministry experience as the 'bottom \n        line' to determine readiness form missionary service. This is based on \n        the premise that a person won't accomplish on the field in a cross cultural \n        environment what he/she hasn't done at home. This makes the local church \n        vitally important because ministry in the context of the local church \n        is the proving ground. Missionary service is an extension of the ministry \n        of the local church if it is a sending church.</p>\n      <p>&#x93;In my opinion, an individual 'fit' in ministry is the result of \n        a discovery process. Spiritual giftedness emerges from involvement, from \n        engaging in different areas of ministry activity. (I give my definition \n        of a spiritual gift: recognized by others, confirmed by inner personal \n        satisfaction)&#x94;</p>\n      <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/go_gifts.htm\">Spiritual \n        Gifts </a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n       \n      \n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/go.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/graphics/gosmall.gif\" width=\"120\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Missions Prefield Training Manual\"></a> \n      </p>\n      \n       \n      <div><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/index.htm\">Home</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/aware.htm\">Awareness</a> l <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/involve.htm\">Involvement</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/join.htm\">Join</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/passport.htm\">Passport</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/calendar.htm\">Calendar</a> \n        <br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/missions.htm\">Missions \n        Dept</a></div>\n    </td>\n  \n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Missionary Indispensables","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/go_maturity.htm"}

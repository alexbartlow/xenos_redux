Your call is to \n        the Lord himself&#x97;sharing life together with Him and thus revealing \n        Him.&#x94;</p>\n      <p>2 Peter 1:3-11 \"How mighty are the magnificent promises that contain \n        all that is necessary for life and godliness\".</p>\n      <p>Nee: \"God will not commit the handling of men to a man who himself \n        has not been molded by His hands\".</p>\n      <h3>The conflict within a healthy inner life<br>\n      </h3>\n      <p>We must have accurate intelligence information on the enemy. Again, the \n        scripture is our plumbline. Worldview, the way we perceive our world to \n        be, is important; and we all have a worldview. Study the worldview of \n        yourself, your culture, and other cultures in which you minister. Let \n        the Bible be the ultimate decision maker. As you do, you will know that \n        Satan is real.</p>\n      <h3>Spiritual Strategies/Principles for Development</h3>\n      <p>\"We have sought to understand that our global task is spiritual. \n        Further, this task requires spiritually qualified messengers, both in \n        life and in ministry gifts. We could well cry out with Isaiah, 'Woe is \n        me, for I am undone! Because I am a man with unclean lips, and I dwell \n        in&#xA0; the midst of people with unclean lips, for my eyes have seen \n        the King, the Lord of Hosts' (Is 6:5). We, as he, can experience what \n        only God can do--a cleansing and the making of a servant vessel. The developmental \n        task is not all ours! The Lord who calls his servants has promised to \n        equip, to go before, and go with all whom he sends. Because christian \n        ministry is done in a warfare environment, we must appropriate all the \n        spiritual equipping available for our task.</p>\n      <h3>5 basic steps to fullness or equipping:</h3>\n      <p>1. Hunger&#x97;(Ps 42:1; 63:1-4; 73:25-28) This is a hunger and thirst \n        for the Lord Himself. Make sure your desire is for the living God himself \n        and not merely his blessings or equipping.</p>\n      <p>2. Brokenness&#x97;Allow the Holy Spirit to convince you of anything \n        unlike Jesus in you. Allow no excuses or cover-up mechanisms to remain.</p>\n      <p>3. Believe&#x97;Ask the Lord in faith for His fullness and power. (Matt \n        7:7-11; Jn 7:37-39; 14:13-15)</p>\n      <p>4. Yield&#x97;present your body as a living sacrifice, hold nothing back, \n        surrender all to Him</p>\n      <p>5. Walk in the light&#x97;Don't allow yourself to be selective. In your \n        walk of obedient love, your Lord will reveal himself to you and 'make \n        His abode with you'. Praise God for His presence and His power as He lives \n        in and through you.</p>\n      <p>\"Practice the dynamics of spiritual growth. (1 Tim 4:7) discipline \n        yourself for the purpose of godliness. Put yourself in God's gym. Make \n        likeness to Jesus the passion and pursuit of your life. Study the word \n        daily, seek first His kingdom, pray without ceasing, witness, make disciples, \n        and plant the church of Jesus Christ. Become a world christian. Heaven's \n        best will be yours. You can be a chosen and effective global harvester!\"</p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/go_phase1.htm\">Phase \n        One Steps</a>&#xBB; </p>\n       \n      \n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/go.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/graphics/gosmall.gif\" width=\"120\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Missions Prefield Training Manual\"></a> \n      </p>\n      \n       \n      <div><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/index.htm\">Home</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/aware.htm\">Awareness</a> l <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/involve.htm\">Involvement</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/join.htm\">Join</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/passport.htm\">Passport</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/calendar.htm\">Calendar</a> \n        <br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/missions.htm\">Missions \n        Dept</a></div>\n    </td>\n  \n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Conclusion and Strategies","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/go_strategy.htm"}

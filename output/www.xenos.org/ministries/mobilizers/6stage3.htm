In other words, someone \n      can be heavily involved at the personal or organizational level without \n      having a great deal of awareness or interest at the global level. Many mobilizers \n      feel they must take a particular person or group they are seeking to mobilize \n      into all three dimensions, but this is not necessarily true. For example, \n      people may know little or nothing about a mission organization and yet show \n      deep commitment to specific workers by encouraging, praying for and supporting \n      them. </li>\n    <li>There \n      is a limit to how many &#x93;lines&#x94; can be crossed during a particular \n      mobilization interaction i.e. conference, meeting, conversation, presentation, \n      brochure, video, etc.). Usually two or three lines\" is the maximum we should \n      expect to cross at one time. </li>\n    <li>Finally, \n      it appears that mobilizers are more effective when they are able to identify \n      &#x93;where&#x94; their Audience is at a particular time and the specific \n      destination they want them to move toward. Then they can plan specifically \n      the kind of elements that are more likely to accomplish that objective. \n      </li>\n  </ul>\n            <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/graphics/missions_6stagemodel4.gif\" width=\"450\"></p>\n  <p>The \n    final element of the model concerns mobilizing. It is not the goal of mobilization \n    that every person involved in world evangelization becomes a mobilizer&#x97;but \n    some should. While mobilizing is not a &#x93;multi-level marketing program.&#x94; \n    Some who get involved will be effective in mobilizing others. This aspect \n    of the model is illustrated in the figure above. We have left the most significant \n    assumption for last. Mobilization is not the product of a mobilizer's ministry. \n    It is the work of God through Christ by the Holy Spirit calling, motivating \n    and equipping His people for involvement in His work&#x97;to bring from every \n    people, language, tribe and nation those who will share in His salvation and \n    become worshippers of the Lord Jesus Christ. Because this is God's work, we \n    recognize that prayer for resources is the absolutely essential pre-requisite \n    for effective mobilization. It is only as God moves His people that His work \n    will have the resources needed to complete the task. </p>\n            \n  </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Six-Stage Mobilization Model - Observations","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/6stage3.htm"}

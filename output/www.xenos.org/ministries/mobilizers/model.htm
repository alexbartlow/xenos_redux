These \n    agencies are usually chosen by the missionaries, based on their own criteria. \n    The church will frequently have some contact with the agency, but most communication \n    with the field is through the missionaries. Many independent churches will \n    find themselves involved with several different agencies, and large churches \n    may work through eight, twelve, or more. </p>\n  <p>Xenos \n    Christian Fellowship is a fairly large, young, independent church in Columbus, \n    Ohio. In the 1980's we had grown very rapidly, which forced us to focus on \n    equipping new leaders for our home groups and ministry teams. We had devoted \n    little attention to missions in the 70's or early 80's, in spite of a heartfelt \n    desire to do our part in other cultures. Therefore, when our leadership sat \n    to consider where we were going to go in world missions, we had the opportunity \n    to write on a blank chalkboard rather than one cluttered with existing alliances \n    and commitments. </p>\n  <p>The \n    Xenos leaders decided we wanted direct involvement with our missionaries and \n    their ministries. We didn't want to simply have our people feel called to \n    different fields and agencies and expect the church to give its blessing and \n    support. We realized that Xenos had it's own ministry ethos and emphases that \n    were quite different than other churches. Xenos is very non-traditional and \n    eager to avoid exporting a western-style church to new people groups where \n    those forms would become a nuisance. We felt a strong desire to keep our missionaries \n    working together in teams on the field like they were used to doing in this \n    country. </p>\n  <p>We \n    also wished we could find a mission agency that understood and appreciated \n    our approach to ministry and our theological distinctives. Such an agency \n    might be willing to place our people together in teams, perhaps with missionaries \n    from other churches who feel compatible with our approach. Also, we felt that \n    if we were willing to commit a good number of people to the field, an agency \n    might be willing to include us in a partnering agreement, and share key decision-making \n    responsibility with us. </p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/model2.htm\">next \n    page</a>&#xBB; </b> \n    </p>\n  \n</td>\n  </div><hr class=\"rdb-page-break\" /><div><td width=\"4\" height=\"186\" valign=\"top\"></td>\n    <td width=\"129\" height=\"186\" valign=\"top\"><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/index.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/mobilizerslogo.gif\" width=\"120\" alt=\"Missions Mobilizers logo\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\n    <td width=\"478\" height=\"1567\" rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\"> \n  <p><b>A \n    Model for Church/Sending Agency Cooperation</b><br>\n    </p>\n  <p><b>Page \n    2&#x97;Establish a Partnership</b></p>\n  <p> \n    We set out to establish a partnership, first studying and interviewing several \n    different agencies. We finally found a good level of compatibility with World \n    Team. Two of their top leaders came and spent several days at Xenos, observing \n    our meetings and talking to our leaders. They were excited about our approach \n    to equipping and home group planting, which they felt was similar to strategies \n    they were using on other fields. We decided to hold talks on a new kind of \n    church-agency partnership agreement. </p>\n  <p>After \n    months of give and take, we approved the final draft of our agreement. It \n    included provisions for decision making on </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>who \n      would go to what field, including screening procedures</li>\n    <li>field \n      selection and research</li>\n    <li>missionary \n      training and preparation</li>\n    <li>how \n      teams would be composed and led</li>\n    <li>field \n      supervision</li>\n    <li>financial \n      responsibility and budget planning</li>\n    <li>visitation</li>\n    <li>home \n      leave arrangements </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Xenos \n    and World Team have worked together under this agreement, with modifications \n    from time to time, for the past 8 years. Xenos leaders strongly urge those \n    in our church who feel called to missions to consider going as a Xenos-World \n    Team missionary. To date, we have accredited and sent nearly 30 career missionaries \n    to 5 different fields under this agreement. Xenos also has missionaries working \n    under other agencies now, and in the past. But as our experience has accumulated, \n    we see more and more benefit to the World Team/Xenos partnership. </p>\n  <p>Some \n    of the key benefits we see are:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>The \n      leaders at Xenos and those at World Team have built rewarding personal relationships \n      over these years. If we had been working with half a dozen agencies, we \n      never would have been able to spend time and energy at the same level. The \n      friendships we enjoy at the leadership level have been very beneficial at \n      times of need or crisis on the field. Nothing serves better when resolving \n      misunderstandings than trusting relationships.</li>\n    <li>The \n      loyalty the two groups have shown each other has opened doors for cooperation \n      on other projects. World team leaders regularly help Xenos with their missions \n      classes and events. Xenos leaders have consulted for World Team leaders' \n      churches and policy meetings. The agency and the church regularly work together \n      on missionary assessment, field research, and other areas.</li>\n    <li>Xenos \n      leaders have a visitation program for supporting our field operatives, and \n      World Team visits the same missionaries for regular reporting and oversight. \n      This is very typical of course, but with the partnership, there's a difference. \n      Xenos and World Team leaders see themselves working together both in pastoral \n      issues and field strategy. Therefore, the issues one group of leaders sees \n      when on the field or interacting via email are regularly shared with the \n      other. Nothing is more helpful than a well-informed &#x93;heads up&#x94; \n      when visiting people we haven't seen for some time. Likewise, Xenos leaders \n      have been able to serve as intermediaries at times between our field teams \n      and World Team. Overall communication has been enhanced.</li>\n    <li>Initiative \n      to open new ministries can come either from World Team or from Xenos leaders. \n      Xenos enjoys extensive access to expertise from World Team in our planning. \n      World Team enjoys a ready supply of eager, well-trained operatives from \n      Xenos along with 70% their financial support.</li>\n    <li>Xenos \n      and World Team are developing new approaches to training for missionaries. \n      Instead of relying only on the traditional degree from a seminary, we now \n      urge prospective missionaries to spend one or more years engaged in urban \n      house church planting under the supervision of experienced leaders at Xenos. \n      This field experience runs in parallel with a Bible/missiology/ministry \n      course series suited to the kind of work missionaries can expect to do on \n      the field. The new training approach will be compatible with more traditional \n      training approaches.</li>\n    <li>Because \n      of our partnership, we at Xenos are convinced that World Team leaders understand \n      our wide ranging problems and concerns in a way no other agency would be \n      able. Likewise, World Team is able to request help from Xenos for specific \n      needs in various fields. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Partnership \n    has been the spirit desired by missions agencies for many years. Yet, for \n    some reason, churches and agencies have not formed specific partnership agreements \n    very often that we are aware of. Lately, large churches are increasingly interested \n    in these kind of agreements. Perhaps this partnership will be helpful in suggesting \n    a new direction that could potentially place agencies and churches in closer \n    cooperation when reaching out to the unreached millions. </p>\n  \n</td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"A Model for Church/Sending Agency Cooperation","rendered_pages":2,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/model.htm"}

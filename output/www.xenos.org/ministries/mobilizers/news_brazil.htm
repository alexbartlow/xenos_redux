In October, Beth and I made our first return visit. \n        </p>\n      <p><b>Conference \n        Unites Team <br>\n        </b> Xenos missionaries of World Team Brazil attended an annual field \n        conference in October-one of the best conferences we've had! We enjoyed \n        good fellowship, taking time for each of us to share how we're doing and \n        to pray for each other. </p>\n      <p>These \n        yearly field conferences provide a time for business, fellowship and oversight \n        by the Area Director. The Brazil field is fortunate because we have turned \n        over all properties to national churches. We hold no assets and there \n        are no salaries to consider. Instead, we can devote our time to review \n        our vision, goals and plans as well as to fellowship. </p>\n      <p>This \n        has been a very helpful process for us, since there are always more opportunities \n        for ministry than time to do it. It is essential that our vision and priorities \n        be clear. </p>\n      <p><b>WT \n        Brazil firms their focus <br>\n        </b> One of the agenda items we have been working on is our ministry core \n        values. If vision answers the question, \"What will we do?\" then a philosophy \n        of ministry answers the question, \"Why will we do it?\" </p>\n      <p>Another \n        helpful agenda item is our annual review of goals and objectives. Right \n        now, WT Brazil consists of four couples: </p>\n      <p><i>Beth \n        and I</i> work with Bible Alliance pastors, training and leadership development \n        with WT on an international level. Beth is also part of the six-member \n        international training team with WT. We continue to be a part of the Brazil \n        work, even while we are in the U.S. by making regular trips to visit the \n        team in Brazil. </p>\n      <p><i>Mark \n        and Stephanie Watkins</i> of Xenos joined the team in May 1998, and are \n        now part of the central church in Caxias do Sul. They will do an internship \n        there for these next two years as they learn more about the churches and \n        the culture. </p>\n      <p><i>Lowell \n        and Kathy Bailey</i>, both approaching 70, first opened the field some \n        40 years ago. Lowell works primarily in promoting church planting and \n        multiplication through the cell group model. He has translated several \n        books and is frequently sought as a speaker and trainer. </p>\n      <p><i>Mickey \n        and Cherrie Counter</i> have worked in the Sao Leopoldo church since 1995, \n        and are now training and building up the elders and multiplying cells. \n        </p>\n      <p><b>The \n        Watkins settle in<br>\n        </b> Mark and Stephanie are settling into their house in Caxias do Sul. \n        They have some things to fix or set up, but enjoy the quiet neighborhood \n        and living close to the kid's school and their church. We were pleased \n        to see how well their children are adapting-even playing in Portuguese! \n        </p>\n      <p>Hospitality \n        is clearly one of the Watkins' family strengths. While I visited, one \n        of the elders and his wife came to dinner. This provided a great opportunity \n        to talk about the vision of the mission, and possible roles for Mark and \n        Stephanie. </p>\n      <p>Another \n        interesting opportunity opened up for the Watkins. They have been invited \n        by the elders to sit in on the elders meetings. I had hoped for this, \n        but didn't think they would be offered this chance so soon. This will \n        improve their Portuguese and their relationships, as well as give them \n        insight into the functioning of the church and future ministry opportunities. \n        </p>\n      <p><b>Retreats \n        follow conference <br>\n        </b> After the conference, Beth had two great opportunities to minister \n        to the churches. First, she participated in \"Day in the Word\" in the Caxias \n        do Sul church. More than 100 women showed up to hear her present four \n        messages called, \"Being women of God in the 21st century.\" This was the \n        first time she was invited to speak to this group. The reception was great-they \n        already asked her to come back next year and do a full-scale retreat! \n        </p>\n      <p>Beth \n        also taught a weekend retreat for the women of the Novo Hamburgo church, \n        who she's worked with the last five years. They have participated in her \n        META (Maturity, Education, Training and Application) discipleship program. \n        This program has been turned over to national workers who are continuing \n        the work in Novo Hamburgo. </p>\n      <p>During \n        the visit, I had opportunities to interact with some of the key pastors \n        we have worked with, such as Daniel Lima of the Caxias do Sul church. \n        We hope he and his wife, Ana Paula, and their four kids have the opportunity \n        to see a Columbus winter and spend time at Xenos. </p>\n      <p><b>Visits \n        to Novo Hamburgo church prove fruitful <br>\n        </b> We weren't sure what to expect on our first visit after an investment \n        of five years. We were pleased to find a healthy and growing church with \n        a leadership team working together. </p>\n      <p>Our \n        intern, Roger, and his wife, Vanuza, are grateful for their new baby girl \n        and for many ministry opportunities. They wonder what will happen in March \n        when the internship ends, but are trusting God to open doors. They have \n        been involved in training cell group leaders, and may be invited to pastor \n        a church plant in Farropilha-if leaders of Novo Hamburgo don't offer them \n        a position first! </p>\n      <p>In \n        the end, Beth and I felt a sense of closure on the five years we spent \n        with the Novo Hamburgo church. They face a number of challenges, but they \n        have a good solid leadership team, the church is excited and seeing new \n        people attend, and some of the cells are multiplying. </p>\n      \n    </td>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Passport: Prayer-Where the Real Battles Are Fought","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/news_brazil.htm"}

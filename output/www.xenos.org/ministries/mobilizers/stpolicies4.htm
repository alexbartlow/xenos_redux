It can be very rewarding to see people come home \n    motivated to direct resources toward the expansion of God's kingdom. It is \n    also a tremendous privilege to witness all of the answered prayer that occurs \n    in making a trip come together. An effective leader will strive to serve the \n    team by helping them prepare for the experience, process their reactions to \n    the culture, develop as a world Christian, and keep their focus directed on \n    the Lord. </p>\n  <p>Responsibilities \n    of Team Leaders include: </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Communication \n      with Xenos and/or Field Leader for trip planning </li>\n    <li>Supervision \n      of team recruiting and selection </li>\n    <li>Coordination \n      of pre-trip team preparation, team building, and fundraising activities \n      </li>\n    <li>Sound management \n      of funds raised, in conjunction with XCF Accounting Department </li>\n    <li>Confirmation \n      of logistical arrangements, including air transportation, lodging, documentation, \n      inoculations, etc. </li>\n    <li>Oversight \n      of daily schedule and assignments while on the field </li>\n    <li>Preparation \n      of the team for re-entry </li>\n    <li>Encouragement \n      of potential team leaders and missionaries </li>\n    <li>Debrief of \n      the church upon return </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>The team leader \n    should also enlist a group of prayer supporters as a first priority. There \n    is much to do; much that takes longer than expected. And since there is a \n    high potential for significantly changed lives, spiritual warfare is to be \n    expected. Effective completion of these responsibilities will be very time-consuming \n    and mentally taxing for any one person. Leaders should consider delegating \n    different responsibilities to various team members or volunteers, and thereby \n    create ownership, encourage personal growth, and develop future leaders. </p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/stpolicies5.htm\">next \n    page</a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n            \n</td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Short-term Mission Trips within Xenos - Team Leadership","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/stpolicies4.htm"}

The \n    ultimate goal is God&#x92;s goal&#x97;to see &#x93;&#x85;a great multitude, which no one \n    could count, from every nation and all tribes and tongues, standing before \n    the throne and before the Lamb&#x85;&#x94; (Revelations 7:9). God wants mobilizers to \n    excite and equip the Body of Christ to provide the resources for reaching \n    the world. </p>\n  <p>According \n    to Ralph Winter of the World Center for World Mission, &#x93;Mobilizers are those \n    who channel key resources, training and vision for world evangelization to \n    the Body of Christ. The primary resources needed to see the church established \n    in every people group are:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>prayer \n      for God&#x92;s power and blessing;</li>\n    <li> \n      workers for the harvest;</li>\n    <li>financial/material \n      resources necessary to carry on the ministry.&#x94; </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><b>Stages \n    of Missions</b><br>\n    To \n    reach the goal of providing resources for world evangelization, the Mobilizer \n    should understand the stages of missions awareness and involvement: going, \n    sending, giving and mobilizing. With this understanding, the Mobilizer can \n    identify the stage their audience is in, and more specifically, plan the methods, \n    mediums and resources to enable them to move to the next step. </p>\n  <p>David \n    Daugherty, an OMF Mobilizer, developed a &#x93;Five-Stage model&#x94; showing \n    the stages a person goes through to become actively involved in missions: \n    </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>unaware</li>\n    <li>aware</li>\n    <li>interested</li>\n    <li>concerned</li>\n              <li>involved \n                </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>As \n    the stages progress, the pool of people in each becomes smaller, illustrating \n    that many fail to move on to the next stage. Reasons for withdrawing may include \n    ignorance, apathy, distraction or frustration. </p>\n  <p><b>Moving \n    through the Continuum </b><br>\n    The skilled Mobilizer will others move toward greater involvement.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Moving \n      from &#x93;unaware to aware&#x94; requires capturing their attention through \n      personal contact or visual tools, such as videos, brochures or books.</li>\n    <li>Moving \n      from &#x93;aware to interested&#x94; requires identifying with a felt need \n      or appealing to a personal value, such as with Bible teachings and applications \n      featuring God&#x92;s heart for all people.</li>\n    <li>Moving \n      from &#x93;interested to concerned&#x94; requires introducing a personal \n      dimension to increase desire for involvement, or getting people involved \n      emotionally.</li>\n    <li>Moving \n      from &#x93;concerned to Involved&#x94; requires a specific opportunity to \n      act. It&#x92;s not enough to urge people to pray, give or go, we must provide \n      the means to do these things. Many people become frustrated because they \n      want to be involved, but don&#x92;t know how at the time they are motivated to \n      act. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Keep \n    Two things in mind as you work with people in various stages of mission involvement: \n    </p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>A \n      person can only cross a limited number of steps during a particular interaction. \n      Two or three is usually the maximum to cross at one time. </li>\n    <li>This \n      is God&#x92;s work. The Mobilizer&#x92;s role is to \"mobilize\" the resources. God \n      through the Holy Spirit calls, motivates and equips His people for involvement \n      in His work. </li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>The \n    final element of the model concerns &#x93;mobilizing.&#x94; Get excited! Get \n    others excited! Go mobilize!<b> \n    </b></p>\n            \n  </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Passport: You're a Missions Mobilizer...Now What?","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/passport_nowwhat.htm"}

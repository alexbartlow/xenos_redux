This may occur, among other ways, at \n    a mission conference, by reading a missionary biography, interacting one-on-one \n    with a missionary or a mission mobilizer, watching a mission oriented video, \n    etc. Whatever the avenue, our budding World Christian is on his way.</p>\n  <p><b>Preparation \n    and Training </b><br>\n    In phase two we see many further steps of yielding and obedience, leading \n    to new convictions as a World Christian and the deepening of existing convictions. \n    This phase is crucial if we are to see a person establish a World Christian \n    life-style. Normally these further steps of obedience are facilitated by organized \n    growth experiences such as a short-term mission abroad, establishing a consistent \n    habit of intercession for mission-related needs, efforts to befriend international \n    students, the development of a \"wartime life-style,\" participation in a local \n    mission fellowship, caring for particular missionaries, etc. </p>\n  <p>Moving \n    into specific mission training in more specialized areas of interest and study \n    is eventually necessary for on-going growth and development, especially as \n    a person gains a clearer understanding of his or her strategic place of long-term \n    involvement in the cause. (Note: This is not just for those called to the \n    field, but for all believers.) </p>\n  <p><b>SENT \n    ONES&#x97;</b>For those who will be sent out as missionaries, this phase may \n    take place in a general candidate training program through Wycliffe's Summer \n    Institute of Linguistics, Missionary Training International, or more likely, \n    in actual candidate training prescribed by the mission agency under which \n    the person will serve. For a great set of brochures that deal with most of \n    the initial questions and issues raised by those called to the field, go to \n    the <a href=\"http://www.calebproject.org/mibs.htm\">Caleb Project</a> website, \n    or contact Caleb Project at: 303-730-4170. Another source of help is a new \n    book titled: <i>Send Me! Your Journey to the Nations</i>, written to help \n    prospective missionaries understand all that is involved in getting to the \n    field (William Carey Library: 626-798-0819 or, <a href=\"mailto:orders@wclbooks.com?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">email</a>). \n    </p>\n  <p>It \n    is well to note that there are a number of churches today who are developing \n    church-based missionary training and internship programs to provide candidates \n    with an excellent training experience and proving ground before going to the \n    field. Many of the churches belonging to the <a href=\"http://www.antiochnetwork.org\">Antioch \n    Network</a> fit this category. Their address is: 5060 N. 19th Ave., Suite \n    306 Phoenix, AZ 85015, USA, Ph: 602-589-7777, <a href=\"mailto:antiochnetwork@xc.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Email</a>.</p>\n      <p><b>SENDERS&#x97;</b>Training \n        for senders is carefully addressed in the book <i><a href=\"http://www.eri.org\">Serving \n        as Senders</a></i> by Neal Pirolo which contains a study guide for small \n        group usage (currently available in 8 languages o Ph: 619-292-7020). Also, \n        the <i><a href=\"http://www.wheaton.edu/bgc/emis\">Evangelical Missions \n        Quarterly</a></i> can be very helpful to senders as it often covers key \n        issues that face missionaries on the field and on furlough. Knowledge \n        of these issues equips senders to better appreciate what missionaries \n        face and how they can best assist them.

By mid-2000 \n    an updated version should be available <a href=\"http://www.uscwm.org\">online</a>.</p>\n      <p>Nate \n        Wilson of Caleb Project provides 1) a <a href=\"http://www.calebproject.org/bomm/dbindex.htm\">Mission \n        Mobilizer's database</a> with extensive information for mobilizer's and \n        2) a mobilizer's email conference with over 650 participants from 55 countries. \n        Note: Entries in this database are from multiple sources with various \n        levels of knowledge and expertise and should always be recognized as such. \n        To subscribe, send a blank <a href=\"mailto:subscribe-brigada-orgs-missionmobilizers@xc.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">e-mail</a>. \n        If you do not have web access, you can request an application by <a href=\"mailto:natewilson@xc.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">email.</a> \n        </p>\n  <p>Finally, \n    a must-read book covering all four dimensions of missions involvement is,<i> \n    Run with the Vision</i>, by Bob Sjogren and Bill Stearns (<a href=\"mailto:orders@wclbooks.com?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">William \n    Carey Library</a> Ph: 626-798-0819).</p>\n  <p><b>Mission \n    </b><br>\n    Ultimately, everyone who successfully moves through this process of mobilization \n    becomes a sender, a mobilizer, a welcomer or a sent one (or any combination \n    of the above). </p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/process6.htm\">next \n    page</a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n            \n</td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Three Phases of Mobilization","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/process5.htm"}

Go to their website for the locations of upcoming conferences. \n    </p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.calebproject.org/mibs.htm\">Caleb \n    Project</a></b><br>\n    An outstanding website with information for World Christians of all ages. \n    Especially helpful to students are their Mission Issues brochures.</p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.globalambition.org/go99/story.html\">GO \n    Conferences</a></b> <br>\n    Annual student mission conference for the southeast US. For description, see \n    <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/resource_students.htm#vision\">Vision Conferences</a> below.</p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.mfest.bc.ca/international.html\">Missions \n    Fests</a></b><br>\n    Currently Missions Fest conferences are being held in Canada, Australia and \n    New Zealand. These are similar to ACMC conferences, designed especially for \n    training local churches in current missions training and thinking, but are \n    very relevant to students seeking to discover their role in world evangelization. \n    </p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.passionnow.org\">Passion \n    Conferences </a></b><br>\n    Passion Conferences are under the ministry umbrella of CHOICE Resources in \n    Roswell, Georgia. Springing out of 10 years of student ministry on the local \n    campus, the vision of CHOICE Resources is to develop tools and conferences \n    &#x93;leading others to renewed passion for God and fresh encounters of worship.&#x94; \n    Giving leadership to CHOICE since its inception is Louie Giglio. Louie, who \n    has 15 years experience in working with college and university students, travels \n    nationally, speaking to audiences of all ages. His passion is to challenge \n    others to know God intimately, worship Him wholeheartedly and follow Him radically.</p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.stumo.org\">Student \n    Mobilization</a></b><br>\n    Student Mobilization (Stu Mo) targets key campuses in the South Central United \n    States to place enthusiastic, biblically solid staff in order to engage collegians \n    at a spiritual level. Stu Mo uses events such as the annual Kaleo Summer Project \n    and the Christmas Conference to love and challenge students to become laborers \n    for Christ. Stu Mo staff seek to build relationships with, pray for and ministry \n    to key students on campus with the purpose of helping these students develop \n    their own relationship with Christ and personal ministry to other students. \n    This is a challenging, yet exciting activity, as the Lord changes the lives \n    of many. Stu Mo also seeks to bless students with key information on the status \n    of world evangelization, and how they can personally pray and work to accomplish \n    the Great Commission.</p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://thetravelingteam.org\">The \n    Traveling Team</a></b> <br>\n    An offshoot of Student Mobilization. Steve Shadrach, founder of Stu Mo, has \n    for many years thought that a traveling team of young adults who would go \n    from campus to campus igniting vision and passion for the world would be a \n    tremendous asset to God's global army. Todd Ahrend, a graduate of Northeastern, \n    decided to take this vision and run with it. With six months visiting countries \n    in the 10/40 window and another six months of team preparation, what was once \n    a vision is now a reality. The team is now on the road invading campus ministries \n    with a powerful power-point presentation on God's heart for the nations. The \n    team does not recruit to an organization, but to a vision. The first semester \n    is under way and the team will visit some 35 campus meetings including BSU's, \n    Campus Crusade's and Wesley foundations. With some of the top Christian leaders \n    on board, only God knows the impact that this ministry will have in the years \n    to come.</p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.gospelcom.net/iv/urbana\">Urbana \n    Conferences</a></b> <br>\n    Held every three years (next conference is December 2000) Urbana is an opportunity \n    to talk to real-life missionaries. At Urbana, there will be a Missions Exhibit, \n    where you can get information from over 250 mission agencies, graduate schools \n    and seminaries. You can explore short and longer-term overseas mission opportunities \n    or just learn about education programs in missions. You will be able to attend \n    various workshops, worship with a huge multi-ethnic congregation, listen to \n    God's word through his servants, pray with fellow brothers and sisters, and \n    just broaden your perspective on how you can be used by the Lord-at your campus \n    or at your work place. Don't miss this opportunity! </p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.perspectives.org\">U.S. \n    Center for World Vision</a></b><br>\n    See the overview for the USCWM's <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/resource_train.htm#perspectives\">Perspectives</a> \n    course.

GO Conference) \n    that is held each year in the South Eastern U.S. Both conferences are hosted \n    by Global Ambition (no acronyms, please!), a student missions mobilization \n    organization that arose out of the Southeast Regional Inter Varsity Missions \n    Fellowship (IVMF). </p>\n  \n            \n</td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Student Mobilization","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/resource_students.htm"}

They followed the traditions passed \n    down from their ancestors, which were manifested in their daily life&#x97;a \n    life of fear and retribution. Meanwhile, the Richardsons&#x92; were following their \n    burden to share the love of God with these headhunters. </p>\n  <p><i>Peace \n    Child</i>, by Don Richardson, tells the exciting adventure of a man and woman&#x92;s \n    journey to bring God&#x92;s grace to Irian Jaya, one of the most remote and primitive \n    parts of the world. After many perilous attempts to share the love of Jesus \n    Christ with the Sawi, this brave missionary couple succeeded. The Richardsons&#x92; \n    moved into the villages, and with God's miraculous help they bridged unimaginable \n    cultural gaps. </p>\n  <p><i>Peace \n    Child</i> will build your faith as God's heart for the lost unfolds throughout \n    its pages. You will expand your understanding of words like &#x91;dependence, trust, \n    and obedience&#x92; through this first-hand account of the missionaries&#x92; experiences. \n    </p>\n  <p>As \n    you turn the pages through this incredible journey, you will truly be held \n    captive! \n    </p>\n            \n  </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Book Review: Run With the Vision","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/passport_peacechild.htm"}

(See Phase I and II on World Team's Church \n        Planting Continuum--the Pioneer Phase). The role of a member of Church \n        Planting Teams in the early stages of the cycle is similar to the role \n        of an entrepreneur in a start up enterprise as opposed to the role of \n        a department manager in a large firm (leader in a mature church). The \n        role of a department manager can fit into a box, the role of an entrepreneur \n        is \"whatever needs to be done, known and unknown.\" Furthermore, \n        in all humility, in the initial phase of this work we would not want to \n        limit our planning to what we are doing <i>at this moment</i> as there \n        has not been overwhelming success in any program. Most of the success \n        has been the result of a few gifted workers. Therefore, it is important \n        for us as planners and leaders to continue to put the best people we can \n        into these pioneer situations based not just on skills, but more so based \n        on character traits and Christian maturity. The person's character and \n        mettle are more important than their job description, they need to be \n        spiritual opportunists. Situations change drastically. Operations are \n        conducted with uncertain outcomes and failure is common. Oppression from \n        Satan drains one's strength. During all of this one must fight the urge \n        to start a program instead of maintaining personal ministry. With programs \n        we can have control, we can see outcomes, we can make plans and clearly \n        define what we are doing. But usually these programs are not geared to \n        bring people to the Lord because that outcome cannot be planned. The exception \n        would be what we are trying to do now, training workers and facilitating \n        them to start their own ministry, focused on evangelism. We can train \n        in many areas, but the fruit that comes is still, as you know, the result \n        of the blessing of God. Evangelism and soul saving, unlike training, is \n        frustratingly contingent on the hearer's heart and free will. It is much \n        easier to give out rice, start a clinic or do other social programming \n        in lieu of trying to reach out to people who are seemingly not interested. \n        It is easier to teach the Bible to Christians than to continually try \n        to talk to people about Jesus who are opposed to Christianity.</p>\n      <p>People are coming to the Lord. Where there are gifted workers maintaining \n        high contact with the target population, the gospel gets a hearing and \n        some believe. This is not that reproduceable, but we can generally find \n        a few gifted workers per year that we can work with. Our prayer time is \n        to see a time when the converts start outnumbering the Christian background \n        believers, we move on to the next phase of the Church Planting Cycle, \n        and all of our jobs descriptions evolve.</p>\n      <p>This is the most exciting and challenging work that one could hope for, \n        challenging us forward into unchartered areas, forcing us to do things \n        that are \"beyond us.\" We work at what we think is God's will \n        and we find that the fruit comes but often from an area outside our work. \n        As if we are being rewarded for effort or faithfulness and not for our \n        cleverness. To focus only on a plan or a program would be imbalanced. \n        <i>Our job as trainers is to find the gifted, the called and the willing \n        and help them grow as workers.</i></p>\n      <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/go_account.htm\">Accountability \n        Areas </a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n       \n      \n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/go.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/graphics/gosmall.gif\" width=\"120\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Missions Prefield Training Manual\"></a> \n      </p>\n      \n       \n      <div><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/index.htm\">Home</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/aware.htm\">Awareness</a> l <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/involve.htm\">Involvement</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/join.htm\">Join</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/passport.htm\">Passport</a> \n        | <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/calendar.htm\">Calendar</a> \n        <br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/missions.htm\">Missions \n        Dept</a></div>\n    </td>\n  \n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Letter from the Field","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/go_letter.htm"}

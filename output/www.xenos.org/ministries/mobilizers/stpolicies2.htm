This has resulted from \n    a limited supply of resources. Depending on the objectives of each trip, a \n    very small or very large amount of people, time and money may be necessary. \n    The Church is called to be a faithful steward of the resources God has provided, \n    and it must therefore, seriously consider the extent to which it can commit \n    to supplying these resources. The outcome of this decision may change from \n    year-to-year as it is affected by various factors such as ministry emphasis, \n    the number of long-term missionaries being sent to the field, and financial \n    or other shifting priorities recognized by Xenos Christian Fellowship. </p>\n  <p>The benefits \n    of sponsorship are, to the extent necessary for each team, assistance with \n    development of ministry objectives, trip coordination, communication with \n    the field, tax-exempt status, and accounting support. Benefits also include \n    the ability of the team to promote fundraising activities within the Church.</p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/stpolicies3.htm\">next \n    page</a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n            \n</td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Short-term Mission Trips within Xenos - Sponsorship","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/stpolicies2.htm"}

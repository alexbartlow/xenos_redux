Churches that are dynamically involved in mission, based on a clear \n    sense of direction from God, will seek to communicate this vision effectively \n    to every segment of the congregation. </p>\n  <p><b>Motivation.</b> \n    It's easier to motivate mobilizers on the foundation of a clear and compelling \n    vision. People who demonstrate an interest in missions need to be shown how \n    they can play an essential role in fulfilling the vision. If we know their \n    strengths and interests, we can recruit them to effective service. Too often, \n    people are asked to sit on a committee rather than to minister on a team in \n    an area for which they have expressed concern. Good motivation depends on \n    helping people see how they could serve to mobilize others for missions involvement. \n    </p>\n  <p><b>Opportunity.</b> \n    Don't let the flame of missions interest die out after a missions conference \n    or short-term mission experience. Connect motivated people with the right \n    tasks and with other team members who can help them be successful. After a \n    motivational event, be sure to nurture people's enthusiasm and give them opportunity \n    to begin at once to influence others for missions, perhaps by helping prepare \n    for the next event. </p>\n  <p>Ralph \n    Winter, who helped us understand our remaining task, also painted a vivid \n    word picture to illustrate the value of mobilizers. &#x93;Imagine,&#x94; he \n    said, &#x93;that you get word of a flash flood rushing down a canyon towards \n    your small town. In 20 minutes everyone remaining in the town will be drowned. \n    You have two options. You could run from door to door, describing the danger \n    individually to each occupant and warning them to flee; in 20 minutes you \n    could probably save several lives. Or you could alert all the children in \n    the local school and send them one by one to warn their families and neighbors. \n    This kind of mobilization could save the whole town.&#x94; Just so, missions \n    mobilizers can be used by God to influence many other people to get involved \n    in some way in the enormous task of world evangelization. Who are the mobilizers \n    in your church who, like hidden gems, are waiting to be mined? </p>\n  \n  </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Three Conditions for Effective Mobilization","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/mining2.htm"}

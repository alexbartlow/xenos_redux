The first value is the idea of personal success. \n    This value has evolved as the &#x93;pig in a python&#x94; generation has grown \n    up. The hippies of the sixties said that personal success was &#x93;changing \n    the establishment.&#x94; As their dreams unraveled during the seventies this \n    value turned into materialism. Now, in the nineties, the boomers are re-evaluating \n    what success is all about. The status symbol in the eighties was the BMW; \n    in the nineties it is a job! Boomers are realizing that life in the fast lane \n    was not all it was cracked up to be. We have an opportunity to help them find \n    true success! </p>\n  <p>As \n    Christians we know that ultimate success, significance and fulfullment are \n    found only in God. If God is a missionary God, then our significance can be \n    found in participating in God's global cause. In the words of Jim Elliot, \n    &#x93;He is no fool who gives up what he cannot keep, in order to gain what \n    he cannot lose.&#x94; We want to help boomers see that there is no greater \n    cause for their lives than world evangelization! </p>\n  <p>The \n    second boomer value is the importance of fun, challenge, and adventure. Boomers \n    have expressed this value in entrepreneurism, hedonism and risk taking. Can \n    we find a biblical expression to this and a substitute for this value? Hebrews \n    12:2 says &#x93;Jesus, for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross...&#x94;. \n    The omniscent God-Man, when He set His face like flint toward Jerusalem, knowing \n    exactly what he would be facing, did it for the joy of it. Certainly, obedience \n    was an important part of the picture, but don't forget the joy! </p>\n  <p>There \n    is one common trait I have found among missionaries. They love what they do! \n    In my own experience as a missionary in Guatemala, my family and I experienced \n    fear, depression, lice, worms and an endless list of discomforts and sacrifices. \n    But we all look back at those years as truly the greatest in our lives. For \n    there is no joy compared to the pleasure of being part of what God is doing \n    and wants done. When we participate with God in His global cause, the nations \n    get the gospel, God gets the glory and we get the joy. That is a great arrangement! \n    </p>\n  <p>The \n    third value is personal autonomy. This value is very important in understanding \n    how to manage boomers and busters, leading them to get them involved in missions. \n    The pre-boomer generation functioned generally under a hierarchical management \n    structure. That worked well because loyalty, duty and responsibility were \n    their expressed values. The boomers and busters, however, respond better to \n    participatory management. Therefore it is important to give as much authority \n    to them, along with the responsibility. If we involve the boomers and busters \n    in planning for missions, they will be more interested in its implementation! \n    </p>\n  <p>The \n    pre-boomers had the attitude, give me a job, it doesn't matter what it is. \n    The boomers want a job that fits their gifts and experience. Boomers need \n    to be taken on a &#x93;niche hunt,&#x94; helping them find their gifts and \n    place. The apostle Paul alluded to this when he said that the foot should \n    not do what the hand was made to do, etc. </p>\n  <p>We \n    do not know the &#x93;ins and outs&#x94; of what world missions will look \n    like as carried out by boomers and busters. But I do know that it will be \n    different than it has in the past. Some of us have the privilege of being \n    paradigm pioneers. I believe with all my heart that boomers and busters will \n    play a key role in declaring God's glory to every nation on the face of the \n    earth. The North American Church has the gift of entrepreneurism and the ability \n    of sharing it with the global Body of Christ. It is my conviction and hope \n    that entrepreneurial boomers and busters, partnering with the third-world \n    missionary force, will finish the task of world evangelization in this generation \n    by AD 2000, or soon thereafter. So may it be to God's glory! </p>\n  \n</td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Seven Dynamics - Three Values to Address","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/dynamics10.htm"}

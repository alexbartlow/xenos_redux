We all believe this, right? \n    Then why is the average American Christian neither aware of nor significantly \n    involved in God&#x92;s global work? Many Christians are either uninformed or misinformed \n    about God&#x92;s work in the world. In fact, some people buy into three common \n    myths about missions. </p>\n  <img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/graphics/mythsart.gif\" width=\"230\"> \n  <p><b>Myth \n    #1&#x97;The needs are great here at home </b><br>\n    True, we have spiritual and physical needs to meet in our own country, but \n    the needs of the world are incomparably greater. Most American Christians \n    are unaware of the incredible poverty nearly half of the world&#x92;s population \n    endures. For example, did you know that approximately 35,000 children age \n    four and under die of hunger and hunger-related diseases every day? </p>\n  <p>The \n    spiritual needs of the world are just as staggering. Mission researchers estimate \n    that 40 percent of the world&#x92;s population are unreached. This means these \n    people cannot hear the gospel in a way they can understand. Even if there \n    are Christians within some of these cultures, they do not have adequate strength \n    or numbers to reach their own people. </p>\n  <p>Also \n    consider that there is an abundance of resources to meet the needs in the \n    United States. This is not the case for the majority of the world. They need \n    outside help in order to meet the great spiritual and physical needs. </p>\n  <p><b>Myth \n    #2&#x97;God will reach the lost of the world&#x97;somehow</b><br>\n    There is a growing belief among Christians that God will somehow save those \n    who have never heard the gospel. Many Christians have absorbed our culture&#x92;s \n    beliefs in universalism and pluralism. These beliefs water down the &#x93;lostness&#x94; \n    of people, and raise false hopes that unsaved people of the world (40 percent \n    of the world&#x92;s population), will be saved through general revelation. </p>\n  <p>Yet, \n    God has made it clear in His word that &#x93;all have sinned and fallen short \n    of the glory of God&#x94; (Romans 3:23) and &#x93;the wages of sin is death, \n    but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord&#x94; (Romans \n    6:23). </p>\n  <p>Also, \n    God&#x92;s method of world evangelization is human agency. He has given us the \n    ministry of reconciliation (2 Corinthians 5:18.) Christians have the privilege \n    and responsibility to be ambassadors for Christ. </p>\n  <p>Paul \n    addresses the issue of those who have never heard the gospel in Romans 10:13-15. \n    The solution is to send a person to spread the gospel. For the gospel &#x93;is \n    the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes&#x94; (Romans 1:16). \n    </p>\n  <p><b>Myth \n    #3&#x97;Missions involvement is optional</b><br>\n    Many Christians believe if they do not go over seas as a missionary, involvement \n    in missions is optional. This is untrue. The Great Commission was given to \n    all Christians. All believers are to be involved in world evangelization even \n    if they stay here. In fact, it takes several hundred &#x93;senders&#x94; at \n    home to support just one missionary family on the field! As John Mott, the \n    chairman of the Student Volunteer Movement, stated, &#x93;The Great Commission \n    of Christ&#x85;clearly expresses our obligation to make Christ known to all men&#x85;it \n    was intended &#x85;for all time and for each Christian in his own time.&#x94; </p>\n  <p>Our \n    myths about missions must be replaced with the truth of God&#x92;s word. Our eyes \n    need opened to the vast spiritual and physical needs in the world. As American \n    Christians with abundant spiritual and material resources, we need to step \n    out and find our role in the Great Commission. </p>\n  <p><b>Where \n    do you fit into God&#x92;s plan for the world?</b><b> \n    </b></p>\n            \n  </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Passport: Why Missions?","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/passport_myths.htm"}

Ask God to put one specific missionary \n    on your heart and commit yourself to that missionary in a deep, meaningful \n    way. As God leads you, make a definite commitment to Him to pray daily for \n    your partner in ministry. </p>\n  <p>Learn \n    all you can about your missionary: the family, the agency, the country where \n    he or she is serving, the type of work to be done, and the people he or she \n    is working with. </p>\n  <p>Other \n    ways to serve your missionary are to write, send small gifts occasionally, \n    or have them for dinner while on furlough. Be creative! Think about what would \n    lift you up if YOU were in the field. </p>\n  <p>Rejoice \n    with your missionary in his or her answers to prayer. Worship God with thanksgiving \n    for meeting your missionary&#x92;s needs. </p>\n  <p>It \n    is not easy to pray for someone every day for an extended period of time&#x97;no \n    matter how strong your commitment. So, also pray that God would help you to \n    be effective in His ministry of missions! </p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/prayer3.htm\">next \n    page</a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n            \n</td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Pray on Two Levels","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/prayer2.htm"}

In our generation, as \n    never before, whole areas of the world and many people groups have become \n    open to the gospel. More Christians have gone more places, learned more languages, \n    translated more scripture and established more churches than in any other \n    period of history. Christians are recognizing missions as a central purpose \n    of Christ's church. </p>\n  <img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/graphics/whymissions.jpg\" width=\"240\"> \n  <p><b>Scope \n    of Missions Involvement </b><br>\n    Missions is not limited to activities done by a few overseas, but is a whole \n    process in which all believers can and should be actively engaged. Missions, \n    like evangelism, involves establishing a relationship with lost people so \n    the gospel can be demonstrated and communicated in a way they understand. \n    Those who believe the good news are discipled and joined together as a community \n    of believers of the body of Christ. This basic biblical task of evangelism \n    is to be carried on in all parts of the world, not just our backyard, neighborhood \n    or city. </p>\n  <p>While \n    fear of the unknown and the vastness of the task may tend to dim a vision \n    for foreign missions, the Lord emphasized the need to reach out to all nations, \n    even the remotest parts of the earth. This requires specially trained personnel \n    totally committed to Jesus Christ, who are willing to live in different, sometimes \n    antagonistic, cultural settings. For this to work, tremendous support, prayer \n    and encouragement are required of the church at home, or Missions Mobilizers. \n    </p>\n  <p><b>Reasons \n    for Missions Involvement </b><br>\n    Why missions? Human compassion and a desire to change world conditions are \n    frequent responses. While these are valid replies, they neglect the primary \n    reasons for missions. Scripture shows us that missions is grounded in God's \n    character (Romans 3:23-25), and commissioned by Christ (Matthew 28:18-20). \n    And, finally, the lost not only miss the joy of Christian life in this world, \n    but they also are separated from God for eternity. Considering this present \n    and eternal condition of unreached people, missions is essential and urgent. \n    </p>\n  <p><b>Means \n    of Missions Involvement </b><br>\n    The concept of world missions can be overwhelming. We must remember, however, \n    that this is God&#x92;s work, and He knows what we're up against. He has the resources \n    available to meet the challenge when His people are willing to be used. And, \n    He has a variety of means to involve us in His work of world evangelization. \n    </p>\n  <p><b>Missions \n    Awareness and Involvement. </b>Most believers are limited in their understanding \n    of the contemporary missions scene. The more believers understand of God's \n    tremendous work in worldwide evangelization today, the more they will want \n    to be involved. </p>\n  <p><b>Prayer</b>. \n    Prayer is undoubtedly the greatest resource in missions. It evidences the \n    concern of individuals and their conviction that only supernatural intervention \n    can accomplish the task of missions. The potential for opening closed doors, \n    overcoming opposition and winning large groups of people to Christ is unlimited \n    when backed with prayer power. </p>\n  <p><b>Financial \n    Investment. </b>God has entrusted His resources to the stewardship of His \n    people. Paul's words to the Corinthians in 2 Corinthians 9:6 still apply: \n    &#x93;He who sows sparingly shall also reap sparingly; and he who sows bountifully \n    shall also reap bountifully.&#x94; Sacrificial giving, wisely directed, is \n    an essential and fruitful means of involvement in missions. </p>\n  <p><b>Raise \n    Up New Missionaries. </b>Much responsibility lies with the local church in \n    raising up new workers for missionary service. Local church staff, teachers, \n    leaders and parents can be used by God to challenge, instruct and encourage \n    young adults toward the field of God's calling. </p>\n  <p>Indeed, \n    involvement in world missions is one of the greatest challenges Christ has \n    given His church. But Christ's promise, &#x93;I will build my church,&#x94; \n    is being fulfilled today, and He has given us explicit and unique responsibility \n    in this process. \n    </p>\n            \n  </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/graphics/whymissions.jpg","title":"Passport: Why Missions?","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/passport_whymissions.htm"}

Why? Because Xenos church \n    planting teams are home grown in a dynamic ethos of local evangelism, discipleship \n    and home church multiplication. They are unencumbered by many evangelical \n    institutionalized forms and traditions. They have a heart beat for taking \n    the Gospel to those who have never heard, even if the cost is life itself. \n    </p>\n  <p>Many \n    missionary teams blow apart because they are incompatible, immature, lack \n    interpersonal skills or have different philosophies of ministries. Within \n    the context of local ministry Xenos team members develop deep relationships \n    and share a common approach to ministry. They are proven in ministry. World \n    Team fields and ministries are significantly enhanced and become the beneficiaries \n    of this proven ministry experience. </p>\n  <p>A \n    shared vision for an unreached people group and evidences of readiness to \n    take the Gospel cross-cultural is validated by Xenos leaders before World \n    Team takes a Xenos team through its assessment process. Conclusions are shared \n    and acted upon by both Sending Agency and Church. This close partnership provides \n    a strong platform for future ministry by the team. </p>\n  <p>From \n    the mission agency perspective, the partnership has been well worth the effort. \n    Sure, we've had to make changes. There have been issues to resolve together. \n    We've had to re-evaluate some of our procedures. We've been stretched along \n    with Xenos, but together we have both grown. But most importantly, people \n    have been reached with the gospel in Asia, Eastern Block countries and Latin \n    America because of this dynamic partnership. </p>\n  <p>Because \n    World Team has been so blessed by its partnership with Xenos Christian Fellowship, \n    we are actively seeking ten new church partnerships. A shared commitment to \n    fulfilling the Great Commission is the life of such a partnership. Openness \n    to God's leading allows either the church or World Team to identify which \n    people group is to be reached. Because we seek to glorify God we cooperate \n    in carrying out His purposes. </p>\n  \n</td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Interdependence - Mutual Blessing","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/interdependence.htm"}

In the same way a person needs time to pursue \n    God in depth in order to see deep convictions germinate to enable them to \n    make the long haul as a World Christian. </p>\n  <p><b>Abortion \n    is possible&#x97;even probable</b> <br>\n    If realistic evaluation and practical World Christian discipleship is not \n    incorporated into peoples' lives on a daily basis, the abortion of their vision \n    and passion for a world without Christ will very probably take place. Sadly, \n    too few churches in the US today have members who are equipped to recognize \n    and mentor those who sense the call of God to missions. </p>\n  <p><b>Accountability \n    is key&#x97;absolutely essential </b><br>\n    The overarching need to be considered, in light of all the other suggestions \n    in this article, is accountability. To make it in the long haul and to stay \n    true to counter-cultural or cross-cultural avenues of service, it is absolutely \n    essential for people to link up with others of like mind and heart. It's been \n    observed among the thousands of Perspectives alumni that those who do not \n    link up with others in committed and encouraging relationships find that their \n    fervor and on-going growth in World Christian discipleship begins to dissipate. \n    (Note: In response to the great need for World Christian fellowships in local \n    churches, the USCWM's Vision for the Nations video curriculum was designed, \n    in part, to instruct and inspire its participants to dedicate one existing \n    weekly meeting per month to place a significant emphasis on their World Christian \n    involvement.) </p>\n  <p><b>Commitment \n    to Spiritual Leadership </b><br>\n    Don't move forward without a definite commitment from the spiritual leadership \n    of your fellowship. In order to gain the support and respect of local leaders, \n    they need to sense your commitment and loyalty to their concerns. </p>\n  <p><b>(a) \n    Pray for leaders.</b> Nehemiah's life provides some very helpful insights. \n    He had a burden and a vision, but prayed and thought through his project before \n    approaching the elders of Israel. Recognize that prayer gives God the opportunity \n    to take what little we have and make it a great blessing to the nations. Read \n    good books on prayer and on men and women of prayer, imitating what others \n    have done to become effective intercessors. Bathe in prayer all that the Lord \n    puts in your heart to do and you will see a much greater harvest as result. \n    </p>\n  <p><b>(b) \n    Have a plan.</b> When the king called on Nehemiah, he was prepared to respond \n    with a thorough plan. Be aware of your fellowship's existing direction and \n    work for the inclusion of mission from a position of humility and servanthood. \n    And remember to be patient with the Lord's timing. </p>\n  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/process7.htm\">next \n    page</a>&#xBB; </b></p>\n            \n</td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Four Vital Issues","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/mobilizers/process6.htm"}

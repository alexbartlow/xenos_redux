We do the same thing. Each home church of 15-50 students meets weekly to talk about God and our lives. When a home church gets large enough, we divide it and plant an additional new home church. We focus on forming genuine friendships in a warm community. If you're curious about God or about Xenos, a home church is a great place to visit!</p>\n                  <h2>\"The God who made                    the world and\n                    everything in it \n                    is the Lord of \n                    heaven and earth \n                    and does not live\n                    in temples built\n                    by hands.... <br>\n                    Rather, he himself\n                    gives everyone\n                    life and breath\n                    and everything \n                    else.\" </h2>\n                  <h2>-Acts 17:24-25 </h2>\n                  <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/college/graphics/genflannel.jpg\" width=\"263\"></p></td>\n              </tr>\n              </table>\n      \t\t<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/college/hgdirectory.htm\">See a list of Home Churches</a>      \t\t  </p>\n      \t\t<p class=\"clear-block style1\">Below is a map of our Home Churches:</p>\n      \t\t\n      \t\t\n      \t\t\n      \t\t\n            \n\t\t\t      </div> \n      \n    </div></div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/college/graphics/college-banner3.jpg","title":"Home Churches","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/college/homegroup.htm"}

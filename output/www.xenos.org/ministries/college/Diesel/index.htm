We like to have fun while growing in grace. Retreats,\n        road trips, and warm times of fellowship after meetings are typical.\n        We are always sensitive and welcoming to the many non Christians that\n        visit our group. We believe God's will is to win over hundreds of students\n        to faith in Christ, and that's why we've planted six other home churches\n      in the past seven years.</td>\n      <td colspan=\"2\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/college/Diesel/graphics/hanging%20out%20after%20HC2.jpg\" width=\"216\"></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>2651 Indianola Ave<br>\n      Columbus, OH 43202<br>      <img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/college/Diesel/graphics/dieselmap.gif\" width=\"555\"></td>\n      <td>&#xA0;</td>\n      <td><p><strong>North campus location:</strong><br>\n          Come up High Street to Arcadia and turn east.

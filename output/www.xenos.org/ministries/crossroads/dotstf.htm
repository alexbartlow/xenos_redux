Which ones \n          have you experienced, or are familiar with? What the underlying assumptions \n          and beliefs of these practices? </li>\n        <li>Dr. O'Math&#xFA;na notes that modern medicine has tended to give the impression \n          that health is the result of physical processes only. What are the problems \n          with viewing health as purely physical? How have promoters of alternative \n          medicine used postmodern ideas to capitalize on this weakness in modern \n          medicine?<br>\n        </li>\n        <li>Jean Watson, President of the National League for Nursing for 1995-7, \n          wrote: \"Nursing, like all other disciplines, must now yield to \n          a postmodern approach, . . . realizing that in this postmodern time, \n          science, knowledge, and even images of nursing, health, environment, \n          person become one among many truth games\" (<i>Nursing Science Quarterly</i> \n          8 (1995): 60-4). What does she mean by this? What are the implications \n          of her view? </li>\n        <li>According to the TV news program, \"Day One\" (8/22/95), thousands \n          of people contracted a disease called EMS from contaminants in the health-food \n          product L-tryptophan--an herbal product. There is as yet no cure for \n          this painful disease which to date has led to 36 deaths. Dr. O'Math&#xFA;na \n          predicts we will hear more stories like this if postmodern ideas are \n          used to promote medical products and procedures. Why might he think \n          this? </li>\n        <li>Dr. O'Math&#xFA;na argues against using anecdotal evidence and personal \n          experience as a way to validate medical treatments. What is the difference \n          between what he is critiquing and simply getting advice from others \n          based on their experiences (which he would recommend doing, especially \n          in medical matters)? </li>\n        <li>Some people who practice therapeutic touch claim that God is their \n          source of healing, not <i>prana</i>. Thus, they see no problems with \n          Christians practicing therapeutic touch. Would you agree with this position? \n          What biblical passages or principles would you use to support your conclusion? \n        </li>\n        <li>Dr. O'Math&#xFA;na pointed out that practitioners of alternative medicine \n          often encourage people to just try their methods and see if they help. \n          \"What harm could there be in that?\" they rhetorically ask! \n          Well, what harm <i>could</i> there be in just checking out some of these \n          practices? Are there any practices you think Christians should be especially \n          careful to avoid? Why? <br>\n          <br>\n        </li>\n        <li>The ideas behind some types of alternative medicines are based on \n          insight and revelation received during meditation and altered states \n          of consciousness. Many others place great emphasis on intuition. For \n          example, Engebretson and Wardell state, \"The patient should be \n          encouraged to trust her or his own intuition and judgment\" about \n          alternative healing methods and practitioners (<i>Nurse Practitioner</i> \n          18 (1993): 51-5). Use, for example, Jeremiah 23:26-17, 25-32 and Ezekiel \n          13:2-3 to develop a biblical response to this notion.<br>\n          <br>\n        </li>\n        <li>In her book on New Age experiences (<i>Testing the Spirits</i>, InterVarsity \n          Press, 1995), Elizabeth L. Hillstrom notes that the early stages of \n          Eastern-style meditation often includes a variety of physiological experiences. \n          \"They may include rapturous feelings, electrifying thrills and \n          chills that move through the body, sensations of tingling, prickling, \n          intense heat or cold, or of bugs crawling on the skin\" (p. 120). \n          Do you see any connection between these and the experiences reported \n          by practitioners of therapeutic touch?<br>\n          <br>\n        </li>\n        <li>The Spiritual Emergence Network is a New Age organization with 1100 \n          trained counselors operating out of 40 centers around the U.S. Its primary \n          purpose is to support and counsel people through what are called \"spiritual \n          emergencies.\" These are seen as emotional and spiritual crises \n          which have the potential to lead either to severe depression and further \n          emotional problems, or to greater spiritual enlightenment. This organization \n          wants to help people have the latter outcome. People experience these \n          crises after starting meditation or any practice which brings them \"into \n          more direct and conscious relationship to their own life force, or <i>prana</i> \n          in Sanskrit\" (Emma Bragdon, <i>The Call of Spiritual Emergency</i>, \n          Harper &amp; Row, 1990, p. 5). What does the existence of this group \n          tell you about the nature of meditation? What implications would this \n          have for practitioners and receivers of <i>prana</i>-based practices \n          like Ayurvedic Medicine and therapeutic touch? </li>\n      </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Death of Truth Group Study Guide - Chapter 5","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/dotstf.htm"}

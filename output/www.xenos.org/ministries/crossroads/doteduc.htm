The report was entitled: \"A Curriculum of Inclusion, \n                Report of the Commissioner's Task Force on Minorities: Equity \n                and Excellence.\" </p>\n              <p>The report goes on to say that </p>\n              <blockquote> \n                <p>\"[This] systematic bias toward Europe and its derivatives \n                  . . .

[explains why] large numbers of children of non-European \n                  descent are not doing as well as expected.\" </p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>Statements like these are manifestations of postmodernism as \n                it impacts public education. </p>\n              <h3>Key Postmodern Educational Concepts</h3>\n              <p>A key word to learn when trying to understand postmodern education \n                is <i>constructivism</i>. Constructivism is the main underlying \n                learning theory in postmodern education. The basic idea is that \n                <b>all knowledge is invented or \"constructed\" in the \n                minds of people</b>. Knowledge is not discovered as modernists \n                would claim. In other words, the ideas teachers teach and students \n                learn do not correspond to \"Reality,\" they are merely \n                human constructions. Knowledge, ideas and language are created \n                by people, not because they are \"true,\" but rather because \n                they are useful. </p>\n              <p>Reality is a story. All reality exists, not objectively--out \n                there--but in the mind of those who perceive it. Nobody's version \n                of reality can claim to have more objective authority because \n                all versions are merely human creations. </p>\n              <p>No, we're not kidding. </p>\n              <p>The implications of this view of knowledge are staggering, as \n                Ruth Zuzovsky points out: </p>\n              <blockquote> \n                <p>\"Another major feature of this tentative, relativist, \n                  and instrumentalist [pragmatic] concept of knowledge is the \n                  <i><b>equal worth</b></i> of knowledge constructed by the learner, \n                  the teachers, or the scientists.\" [emphasis ours] </p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>If no one's knowledge is necessarily true, everything changes. \n                Now the question of what counts as \"knowledge\" to be \n                taught in the schools is <b>not a matter of objective evidence \n                </b>or arguments, but rather a matter of <b>power</b>. Those who \n                have the power can make sure their constructs are the ones that \n                dominate the curriculum, while other opposing viewpoints are at \n                least partially suppressed, ignored or \"marginalized.\" \n              </p>\n              <h3>Teachers</h3>\n              <p>Since the focus of the classroom, in postmodern education, becomes \n                the student's construction of knowledge, they shift away from \n                a teacher-centered classroom to a more student-centered environment. \n                Grayson Wheatley explains, </p>\n              <blockquote> \n                <p>\"Rather than identifying the set of skills [and knowledge] \n                  to be gotten in children's heads, attention shifts to establishing \n                  learning environments conducive to children constructing their \n                  mathematics and science in social settings.\" </p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>A student-centered classroom in this context is likely to have \n                minimal structure. It usually involves opportunities for social \n                interaction, independent investigations and study, and the expression \n                of creativity, as well as provision for different learning styles. \n                There, students create knowledge, and are no longer forced to \n                bow to the subjugation of traditional objective \"knowledge.\" \n                As Everhard explains, </p>\n              <blockquote> \n                <p>\"School knowledge disables to the extent that it silences \n                  students, usurps their minds or at least demands acquiescence \n                  . . .[such knowledge] usually places boundaries between emotion \n                  and knowledge; students do not control knowledge, but rather \n                  'must write their student roles and scenarios in conformity \n                  to the teacher's master script.'\" </p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>So, Selase Williams, and others argue that AAL (African American \n                Language) is a regular language like Spanish or Japanese. He shows \n                that statements like, \"Shanita bin pass dat tes,\" means \n                \"Shanita passed that test a long time ago.\" The difference, \n                he argues is that AAL arises from an <i>African linguistic base</i>. \n                Therefore, inner city kids should be taught in AAL as their mother \n                tongue, with English as a second language. (\"Classroom Use \n                of African American Language: Educational Tool or Social Weapon?\" \n                in Christine E. Sleeter, Ed. <i>Empowerment Through Multicultural \n                Education</i>, p. 205-207) Anything less would be sheer exploitation. \n              </p>\n              <p>Likewise, Glasersfel explains that in other areas of knowledge, \n              </p>\n              <blockquote> \n                <p>\"The teacher would come to realize that what he or she \n                  presents as a 'problem' may be seen differently by the student. \n                  Consequently, the student may produce a sensible solution that \n                  makes no sense to the teacher. To be then told that it is wrong \n                  is unhelpful and inhibiting . . . because it disregards the \n                  effort the student put in.\" </p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>Here, then, we see postmodern relativism at work in a menacing \n                fashion. Children not taught right from wrong, even in areas like \n                science and social studies. Will their employers be so tolerant? \n              </p>\n              <h3>Teachers in Postmodern Education</h3>\n              <p>At least under postmodern theory we aren't guilty of an even \n                worse crime according to postmodern scholar, Johnella Butler, \n                who warns that \"the colonization of minds is characteristic \n                of American education.\" </p>\n              <p>In other words, when dominant culture calls on minorities to \n                speak classroom English, do math, history and science the white \n                man's way, they have acted in the old colonial role, just like \n                earlier Europeans who believed it was their responsibility to \n                colonize non-white cultures and lands, imposing European standards, \n                dress, religion and language on those cultures. </p>\n              <h3>Values</h3>\n              <p>Okay, so they don't want to impose the teacher's \"reality\" \n                on students, why go to school? </p>\n              <p>Actually, they have a definite set of values they hope to inculcate: \n              </p><ul>\n                <li><b>striving for diversity--</b> guarding, unchanged, the existing \n                  values, tastes and way of life of each subculture in our society. \n                </li>\n                <li><b>equality--</b>In postmodern ideology, equality means equal \n                  in terms of power relationships </li>\n                <li><b>tolerance and freedom--</b>tolerance has a new meaning: \n                  roughly, never negating or criticizing oppressed groups. Freedom \n                  for cultures and communities to express themselves </li>\n                <li><b>the importance of creativity-</b>-Creativity is clearly \n                  allied to the postmodern emphases on the construction of knowledge \n                  and diversity. Stimulating and affirming creativity in students \n                  is important in constructing knowledge and values, particularly, \n                  if diverse viewpoints are to be encouraged </li>\n                <li><b>the importance of emotions--</b> Affirmation of emotions \n                  follows along with the importance they place on self-esteem. \n                  They believe that any time children's emotions are challenged \n                  (even hate or selfish jealousy) the child is being disabled \n                  by having the teacher's reality imposed on her </li>\n                <li><b>the importance of intuition--</b>intuition gains in importance, \n                  because rational thought has lost its authority as a means for \n                  dealing with ideas. Modernists tend to suppress intuition and \n                  feelings, according to postmodernists, even though they are \n                  just as legitimate and perhaps even more important than rational, \n                  conceptual (or \"linear\") thought </li>\n              </ul>\n              <h3>The Rest of the Story</h3>\n              <p>From this description it should be clear that postmodern educational \n                theory is a radical departure from what we are used to in education. \n                In <i><b>The Death of Truth</b></i>, you can see all these and \n                many other points in postmodern educational theory, all backed \n                up with material from the leaders of this movement in their own \n                words.

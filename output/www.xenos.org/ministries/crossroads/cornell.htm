We can identify three general characteristics of today's \n                student. First, they are largely<i> uncritical</i>. It is increasingly \n                difficult for students to form reasoned and defensible views in \n                the realm of ideas. In the give and take of rigorous intellectual \n                interaction around divergent ideas students sharpen their analytic \n                skills, find their views challenged by the light of evidence and \n                argument, and develop the ability to think critically and constructively. \n                However, many observe, the ideological climate within the university \n                is often inimical to the development of these skills. When students \n                are taught that values are arbitrary \"social constructions,\" \n                and that there is no objective basis for them, they draw the obvious \n                conclusion that it doesn't matter what view they hold. So the \n                only analytical framework most students know are the vacuous principles \n                of \"openness\" and \"tolerance.\" Students get \n                the message: since there is no truth to be discovered, one view \n                is as good as any other. Consequently, students fail to find a \n                place for reason in the formulation or defense of their ideas. \n                This fosters an anti intellectual environment on campus where \n                ideas are labeled \"acceptable\" or \"unacceptable,\" \n                then monitored and managed, rather than rationally engaged.</p>\n              <p>It has been my experience teaching \n                philosophy, that when students are first confronted with the contradictory \n                nature of their views, they are largely unmoved. One of two responses \n                can generally be predicted. First, students will dislodge belief \n                from reason, by reducing every judgment to opinion. Reason, after \n                all, is for things like science, not values or truth. Secondly, \n                students justify their positions by asserting their right to believe \n                whatever views they want. Discussing abortion in ethics classes \n                often brings this dynamic out. I found the majority of students \n                attracted to the pro life position. They commonly conceded that \n                the fetus is a person, given their intuition that neonates and \n                others are persons. Further, they agreed that killing innocent \n                persons is wrong. But when it came to the inference, \"abortion \n                is wrong,\" the majority of students who agreed with the premises \n                fled from the obvious conclusion. Consistently, the response to \n                this dilemma was \"well, we should be free to do what we want,\" \n                or \"it's still my decision.\" For many, no amount of \n                reasoning could dislodge these sophomoric pronouncement.</p>\n              <p>The majority of students exchange \n                reason for feelings in the formation of spiritual, moral and political \n                beliefs. As we observed in the above example, basic beliefs are \n                justified in the realm of radically privatized, idiosyncratic \n                preference. Individuals and the content of their belief are hard \n                to separate when truth is rooted subjectively, rather than discovered \n                in a world independent of them. Consequently, challenging a person's \n                belief is tantamount to calling into question their right to choose, \n                or their value as a person. Certain beliefs are sacrosanct. It \n                is virtually immoral to engage in critical dialogue where a student's \n                beliefs are politically correct. Since these beliefs are often \n                anti biblical, the work of evangelism on campus is especially \n                difficult.</p>\n              <p>Second, today's students are generally \n                <i>cynical</i>. Some students find their way to identity groups \n                that promote particular ideologies, but many avoid ideological \n                commitment. Holding fast to beliefs, they have learned, is dangerous. \n                True believers, the dogmatists, are often characterized as history's \n                villain. The argument is that when we think we possess <i>the</i> \n                truth, it leads to conflict; and conflict leads to war, prejudice \n                and injustice. So, better not to take anything too seriously. \n                Most students are in a state of indifference toward the world \n                of ideas. Values are at best subjective and at worst malignant. \n                </p>\n              <p>All too often, this kind of cynicism \n                is cultivated in the class room. Instructors can and do unwittingly \n                contribute to the students cynicism. This occurs when professors \n                teach the pursuit of knowledge as either a value-neutral pragmatic \n                exercise (\"isn&#x92;t it fascinating what we can do\"), \n                or an interesting, if irrelevant, mental exercise (\"isn't \n                it amazing what these people thought\"). Independent of meaningful \n                and defensible values, knowledge reduces to technology or curious \n                cultural artifact. </p>\n              <p>Third, students today are <i>alienated</i>. \n                We refer not in the romantic notion of the alienated man of the \n                '60's, but to a palpable sense isolation. More than ever, students \n                come from divorced families. Often cynical of intimate personal \n                relationships to begin with, students from this background find \n                ever more reason to remain isolated through what they learn in \n                college. Meaningful and lasting relationships require trust. But \n                trust requires a shared foundation on which to base relationships. \n                And it is at just this point that the relativism of the university \n                has personal implications for many students. Bellah describes \n                the problem well:</p>\n              <p><em>\"Now if selves are defined \n                by their preferences, but those preferences are arbitrary, then \n                each self constitutes its own moral universe, and there is finally \n                no way to reconcile conflicting claims about what is good in itself. \n                All we can do is refer to chains of consequences and ask if our \n                actions prove useful or consistent in light of our own value systems. \n                All we can appeal to in relationships with others is their self \n                interest, likewise enlightened, or their intuitive sympathies. \n                Where sympathy or already congruent values are not enough to resolve \n                moral disagreements between ourselves and others, we have no recourse \n                except to withdraw from them.\"</em></p>\n              <p>Other forms of alienation also affect \n                college students. Racial minorities, first generation college \n                students and women often feel isolated from the dominant culture \n                of the university community. Isolation often drives minorities \n                and women to life style enclaves, or at least under the ideological \n                influence of these enclaves. Here, alienation from culture is \n                furthered by isolationist ideology. In Women's Studies and Afrocentric \n                Studies curricula, the Christian world view is under considerable \n                assault. It is often characterized as \"paternalistic,\" \n                or \"Eurocentric.\" Christianity is seen as the basis \n                of racism, sexism and ecological tyranny. </p>\n              <p>Much of the thinking that shapes \n                the ideological fortress around students come from the postmodern \n                camp, as these descriptions suggest. But modernism also has it \n                a role. The science-as-knowledge/reality-as-nature hypothesis \n                is appealing to students because it provides an explanation for \n                their observations about the world. The sciences provide a solid, \n                objective base to pursue knowledge. There is, of course, a downside \n                to scientism and students are quick to pick it up. While scientism \n                provides a neat explanation for the operations of nature, it fails \n                to do much for the human self-concept. In fact, scientism is very \n                much about the business of erasing the notion of the<i> individual \n                </i>all together. Sociobiology, artificial intelligence, animal \n                language and other research areas often assert that individuals \n                are nothing other than the sum total of the impersonal processes \n                that constitute their being. Your former colleague Carl Sagan \n                put it succinctly when he defined man as \"an astonishingly \n                compact, self-ambulatory computer.\" It is worth noting that \n                scientism and postmodernism agree on this view of the self. Ironically \n                while popular culture today is obsessed with the self, much of \n                academia is, at least from the stand point of theory, committed \n                to its irradication. If current trends persist, the death of \n                the self in the twenty-first century will follow on the heels \n                of the death of God in the nineteenth and the death of objective \n                values in the twentieth. With the kind of pressures the next century \n                will experience, this is indeed a frightening prospect.</p>\n              <p>So where does this leave the contemporary \n                university student? They are given reasons from every quarter \n                to disregard the Christian message. And indeed, we find that while \n                the debate used to center around the naturalism/theism dichotomy, \n                in recent years Christianity has been pushed out to the periphery. \n                In many ways, the secularized culture of Europe is looking more \n                and more familiar on the American campus today. </p>\n              <p>Our assessment of the student population \n                should not be excessively negative. There are both substantial \n                fortresses raised up against the knowledge of God, and reason \n                to be hopeful about reaching people for Christ in the university \n                community.</p>\n              <b> \n              </b><p><i></i>Circling the Walls</p>\n               \n              <p>An effective Christian presence \n                on campus has many aspects. For the sake of the present discussion, \n                I will briefly identify three factors that need to guide our thinking. \n                First,&#xA0;  \n            </p></td>\n            </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The New Challenge in Christian Apologetics","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/cornell.htm"}

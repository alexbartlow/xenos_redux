They say teachers should simply teach students facts \n          and leave the ethics and belief systems to parents in the home. Other \n          Christians hold that \"value-free\" education is impossible. \n          For example, forbidding cheating, requiring academic performance, etc. \n          are necessary for the educational process, but they are values/ethics. \n          What place do you think values, religious/philosophical beliefs, and \n          ethics have in public education? </li>\n        <li>What are the similarities and differences between the postmodernists' \n          espousal of Afrocentric schools and Christians' espousal of Christian \n          schools? </li>\n      </ul>\n      \n      <ul>\n        <li>Consider the following passage by a science educator and then give \n          your opinion on the questions that follow: </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>\"The study of science and related technology often requires students \n          to adapt to a white male culture, to an Eurocentric/androcentric world \n          view. The basic assumptions of science, as it is taught to American \n          children in textbooks, focus on male as opposed to female and on European \n          as opposed to Eastern or African or South American ways of viewing the \n          world. The axiological and epistemological beliefs of textbook science \n          are tied to a European or white male way of viewing the world. This \n          culture values competitiveness and individual achievement. Most modern \n          science instruction is based on principles of realism. This value system \n          holds that there is an ultimate truth and that humans discover this \n          truth in the natural world. The Eurocentric foundation of science focuses \n          on European (and on those of European descent) values, attitudes and \n          ways of knowing.\" </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>What postmodern ideas are evident in this passage? </li>\n        <li>What are these female and non-European views of truth that the author \n          claims to be different than \"realism\"? Do women, men, Europeans, \n          Africans, etc., <i>as groups,</i> view truth differently? </li>\n        <li>Is it true - wholly or partially - that science is merely a white, \n          European, male, worldview and therefore scientific knowledge is infected \n          with this bias? </li>\n        <li>Are competitiveness and individualism in education a result of white \n          European male influence? What does the Bible say about competitiveness \n          and individualism that is relevant to schooling? </li>\n        <li>How would education be different, if at all, if women and non-Europeans \n          were in control of it? Who should control the education system? </li>\n        <li>To what extent is it true, if at all, that students \"must assimilate\" \n          a certain instructional model in order to be successful at school? How \n          might postmodern education change this? </li>\n      </ul>\n      \n      <ul>\n        <li>Consider this passage, also from Barba: </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>Sometimes teachers believe that culturally diverse children do not \n          excel because they come from families and communities that do not properly \n          prepare students for learning. Teachers occasionally believe that some \n          students do not care if they do well in school, and that these students \n          are not properly prepared to succeed in an academic environment and \n          are not motivated to learn. The cultural deficit model as described \n          by Sleeter and Grant (1990) assumes that schools should change learners, \n          should help them assimilate to mainstream culture, including the \"culture \n          of science.\" From this viewpoint, children need remedial work to \n          compensate for their lack of knowledge, skills, and attitudes in science \n          and mathematics. Those who advocate the use of this world view regard \n          students as being \"at risk\" when they do not share American \n          mainstream language and culture. The National Science Foundation pipeline \n          approach typifies this world view. If we just call the plumber, if we \n          just plug the leaks, then we can \"fix\" the students. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>In contrast to the deficit model, those who adhere to a multicultural \n          model see the cultural and linguistic backgrounds of diverse students \n          as being valuable educational resources. A 'multicultural approach to \n          education promotes cultural pluralism and social equality by reforming \n          the school program for all students to make it reflect diversity.' If \n          one adopts this world view, children who speak a primary language other \n          than English are considered an asset in the classroom because they have \n          constructed a knowledge of science in a different sociocultural context \n          than others in the class and thus bring added resources to the classroom. \n          Those who advocate the use of a multicultural approach to education \n          see diversity as a strength in the classroom, as a vehicle for increasing \n          the learning of all students. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>What postmodern theories and attitudes are evident in this passage? \n        </li>\n        <li>Is it true that sometimes, or all the time, that students do not succeed \n          because of differences between their culture and \"school culture\"? \n          Are there other reasons for why some students might not succeed? </li>\n        <li>For someone who does not believe that the schools should \"change \n          learners,\" what, then, would the school's job be? What is a biblical \n          perspective on the task of schools (including the job of \"fixing\" \n          students)? </li>\n        <li>To what extent is diversity a \"deficit\" and to what extent \n          is it a \"valuable educational resource\"? </li>\n        <li>Which \"world view\" - the \"deficit\" or the \"multicultural\" \n          - is closest to the biblical world view? Or, is there a preferable third \n          alternative? </li>\n      </ul>\n      \n      <ul>\n        <li>Here is one more quotation from Barba: </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>\"Students cannot be \"fixed\" in the way that flat tires \n          are fixed on automobiles. Rather, what is needed is a view of students \n          and schools which affirms everyone. First, we must begin with an assumption \n          that students are not deficient but rather bring a wealth of knowledge \n          of the world around them to the classroom and to their academic endeavors. \n          Second, we must allow students to bring their culture and experiences \n          to each new learning experience. We must affirm our students to assist \n          them in adding knowledge to that which they already possess.\" </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Why do you think this author believes that it is important to assume \n          that students are not \"deficient\"? Do you agree that this \n          is an important assumption? </li>\n        <li>Is it possible, and if so how, to have education without ever telling \n          students they are \"deficient\"? What would be the result of \n          this kind of classroom atmosphere? </li>\n        <li>Is it necessary to be affirmed in order to learn? Why or why not? \n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      \n      <h3>Facilitator's Manual for Education</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Many Christians argue for \"value-free\" education in the \n          public schools. They say teachers should simply teach students facts \n          and leave the ethics and belief systems to parents in the home.

Certainly it is impossible to completely \n          detach values from education. When there was a Judeo-Christian consensus \n          in our culture, it was much easier to trust that the values taught in \n          public schools were for the most part biblical. As our culture becomes \n          truly post-Christian, the amount of common ground in values and ethics \n          has shrunken dramatically.Ideally, a local community could delineate \n          the values on which there is large agreement, and then agree to emphasize \n          these values in the school system. Communities that have done this have \n          been pleasantly surprised at how much consensus is possible (e.g., honesty, \n          diligence, respect for authority, etc.). Where no consensus is possible, \n          they could agree to avoid those issues in lower grades and try to give \n          a balanced treatment of the different views in higher grades. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>What are the similarities and differences between the postmodernists' \n          espousal of Afrocentric schools and Christians' espousal of Christian \n          schools? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Christian schools are privately funded </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Christian schools are not based on race but on a religious point \n          of view </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Christian schools are often open to non-Christians </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Consider the following passage by a science educator and then give \n          your opinion on the questions that follow: </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>\"The study. . .[see Discussion Guide] </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>What postmodern ideas are evident in this passage? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Science and technology are western cultural biases. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Rationality and linear thinking is male. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Whether a particular scientific proposition is true or false is never \n          considered--only that it reflects male European thinking. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Belief that there is a real objective world is male and European? \n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- According to postmodernists, androcentric instructional models are \n          those which focus on \"male\" or <i>individual</i> ways of knowing \n          and doing things.

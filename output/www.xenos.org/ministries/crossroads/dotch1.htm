Popularized forms of postmodern \n              thinking are also diffusing into mainstream culture with a speed \n              never imagined in Darwin's day. Even if the Christian church came \n              to a crystal clear understanding of postmodernism this very day, \n              it would be extremely difficult (though never impossible) to turn \n              back the ideological tide. But even if we fail to sweep society \n              as a whole with the truth, we have to become more effective communicators \n              just to have an impact on our own friends and even our own kids. \n              <p><strong>The Postmodern Challenge<br></strong>As with Darwinism, postmodernism has its origin in intellectual \n                and academic circles. This is why average Christians are unaware, \n                or at least unclear, about what postmodernism is. Even Christian \n                leaders and thinkers find themselves confused as their senses \n                are assaulted by the strange or even seemingly insane language \n                of postmodern analysis. But postmodernists are not insane. As \n                we shall see, they present a dangerously convincing case for their \n                view--a view that ultimately directly undermines all possibility \n                of knowing objective truth (i.e., true whether I realize it or \n                not). The real problem is this: once again, Christians aren't \n                ready for a major challenge to the Christian world view. <br>XChristians are also unprepared to \n                answer postmodernism because it's so hard to describe in laymen's \n                terms. Postmodern jargon is extremely difficult for most people \n                to understand. Recent books on postmodernism don't help most of \n                us because they are written by scholars for scholars. Yet postmodernism \n                isn't just an academic problem. We see signs of postmodern analysis \n                on every hand. For instance: \n              </p><ul><li>The multicultural education movement which argues that the \n                  goal of education isn't to make students conform to dominant \n                  culture's knowledge, but to 'empower' them by accepting their \n                  own standards of literacy. Students don't learn knowledge from \n                  the teacher, but create their own knowledge/ </li>\n                <li>The increasingly universal belief that all cultures are to \n                  be equally \"respected\" and never criticized </li>\n                <li>New calls for segregation based on race, such as Afrocentric \n                  \n                  schools </li>\n                <li>The new importance attached to language, as seen in the \"political \n                  correctness \n                  \n                  \" movement </li>\n                <li>\"Labeling theory \n                  \n                  \" in parenting and education--the idea that children become \n                  what they are labeled </li>\n                <li>Radical victimology \n                  \n                  --the belief that abuse victims of all kinds are a marginalized \n                  \n                  , repressed group with only one hope: to disempower the dominant \n                  group--the victimizers </li>\n                <li>New versions of history \n                  \n                  from the perspective of oppressed interest groups (e.g. feminist, \n                  or gay and lesbian history \n                  \n                  ) that purposely leave out even major events in the past </li>\n                <li>Attacks on Christian missions \n                  \n                  , claiming that missionaries are \"destroyers of culture\" \n                </li>\n                <li>Widespread belief that the courts can never give a marginalized \n                  \n                  ethnic or socioeconomic group a fair trial, because they operate \n                  only to guard the privileges of the dominant culture \n                  \n                </li>\n                <li>Postmodern feminism--the belief that our concepts \"masculine\" \n                  and \"feminine,\" are arbitrary social constructions \n                  intended to subjugate women to men </li>\n              </ul><p>XThe list goes on and on. Although \n                we might not understand how these things are connected, the fact \n                is that they all flow out of the same postmodern analysis.</p>\n              <p><strong>Our Goal</strong><br>\n                In this book, we seek to explain postmodernism in common language \n                without losing all precision. We refer to thinkers and intellectuals \n                occasionally, but don't worry if you have never heard of them. \n                Just keep reading. Reading this book won't be the easiest thing \n                you've ever done, but it may be one of the most rewarding. As \n                Christians, we believe God calls on us to suffer at times for \n                his sake. One key area of suffering for Christians today is the \n                pain, and even nausea, we feel from learning complicated, ungodly \n                world views, like postmodernism, that do not cause us to feel \n                blessed. However, if you devote the time to finish, you will gain \n                an invaluable understanding of this powerful movement--an understanding \n                you will treasure in the years to come. Parents, especially, cannot \n                afford miss this material. For interested readers, we include \n                some details in the footnotes. <br>First, \n                we will look at some definitions, and a comparison of the old \n                secular world-view, which we will call <i>modernism</i>, and the \n                new approach, <i>postmodernism</i>. Then we will see how postmodern \n                thinkers apply this new analysis to several areas of contemporary \n                life and thought. Again, if you feel confused at points, keep \n                reading. Postmodernism <i>is</i> confusing, just as Darwinism \n                \n                was 150 years ago. But as you see it applied, the definitions \n                will make more and more sense. Soon you will see postmodern thinking \n                all around you. It's everywhere--on TV, in the movies, in children's \n                classrooms, in song lyrics and on the news. The trend today, especially \n                in the arts and humanities, is toward postmodernism, and we, as \n                thinking Christians, have to be ready for that trend, or be prepared \n                to lose our voice entirely in the next decade. The first step \n                toward readiness is to understand the view to which we must respond. \n                <br>XWe have assembled a group of researchers \n                and experts for this book, and they will tell us in plain language \n                how postmodernism is being applied to daily living. You will learn \n                things you need to know: \n              </p><ul><li>Find out why people are reading literature, including the \n                  Bible \n                  \n                  , differently than before. The new rage in literary interpretation \n                  is postmodern deconstruction \n                  \n                  .

Postmodern rhetoric \n                  \n                  has made possible the introduction of <i>alternative medicine \n                  \n                  </i>into nursing and medical schools, where superstition is \n                  now taught as being no less credible than proven scientific \n                  principles. </li>\n                <li>Learn how your children are going to be educated \n                  \n                  --not by having teachers transmit knowledge to them, but the \n                  postmodern way--creating knowledge themselves in the new multicultural \n                  student-centered classroom. </li>\n                <li>Find out why history \n                  \n                  is no longer the search for \"what happened.\" Now history \n                  is a platform for radical political and social agitation. Any \n                  student from high school up must understand this material. Postmodern \n                  cultural history \n                  \n                  now makes it possible for the formerly excluded and silenced \n                  groups in society, like gays and lesbians, to tell their story \n                  at last. </li>\n                <li>Postmodern psychology \n                  \n                  screams from every bookstand and TV show today. They all share \n                  a common postmodern premise: reality is in the mind of the client. \n                  We are socially constructed, whether by our community or our \n                  family, each person's reality is created by that person's social \n                  environment. </li>\n                <li>Did you know that, if postmodern legal scholars and lawyers \n                  have their way, we will be facing a legal system \n                  \n                  unlike anything we've seen before? The face of government and \n                  law are about to undergo changes that will make the past two \n                  decades look like a stroll in the woods. </li>\n                <li>Why is interest in science decreasing? Most doctorates in \n                  sciences are now awarded to international students. Why have \n                  science grades fallen to levels below the rest of the developed \n                  world? One powerful reason is the postmodern attack on science \n                  \n                  as the vanguard of western imperialism. In a front page article \n                  on postmodernism, the <i>Wall Street Journal \n                  \n                  </i>quoted one postmodern \"feminist historian \n                  \n                  of science\" as saying that male science has assaulted nature \n                  like a violent man exploits a helpless woman. \"A passive \n                  nature had to be interrogated, unclothed penetrated, and compelled \n                  by man to reveal her secrets.\" Find out why postmodernists \n                  denounce western science, and how this will affect your children \n                  and your world. </li>\n                <li>Religion is at the epicenter \n                  \n                  of the postmodern revolution. Unlike modernism, where religion \n                  was considered superstition, postmodernists have no problem \n                  with religion, as long is it makes no claim to universal truth \n                  \n                  and has no authority. Look for more of the social revolution \n                  to come from the religious sector than in the past. </li>\n                <li>Finally, galloping along, trying to keep up, comes the church. \n                  Yes, even evangelical Christianity \n                  \n                  has been infiltrated with postmodern ideas--you may even find \n                  that you have been toying with postmodernity yourself! </li>\n              </ul><p>XAfter we delve into all these areas \n                of postmodern impact, we will suggest some directions Christians \n                can take in our response to this menacing world view, as well \n                as some positive lessons we can learn from postmodernists' observations.</p>\n              <h3>In Brief</h3>\n              <ul><li>The late 20th century is facing a menacing intellectual revolution \n                  under the general title of postmodernism. </li>\n                <li>Although postmodernism is already affecting every facet of \n                  our lives, Christians are generally unaware of what it is, or \n                  how to respond. </li>\n                <li>This study will give you the tools to understand postmodern \n                  analysis even if you have little interest or training in formal \n                  academic research. </li>\n              </ul><p>Copyright &#xA9; 1996 Xenos Christian \n                Fellowship. <br>\n                All Rights Reserved.</p>\n              </td>\n            <td width=\"10\" valign=\"top\"></td>\n            <td width=\"100\" valign=\"top\"></td>\n          </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Death of Truth: Chapter 1 - Shifting from modernism to postmodernism.","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/dotch1.htm"}

Books on angels, near death experiences, \n                New Age, Christianity and the occult top the best seller lists. \n                While people are still interested in spiritual things today, the \n                <i>kind</i> of spirituality commanding interest has changed vastly \n                in recent years. </p>\n              <p>Today spirituality means <b>mystical experience</b>, not truth. \n                We can seek and savor any experience we please, as long as we \n                remain inclusive and tolerant.</p>\n              <h3>The Two Cardinal Sins of Postmodern Religious Culture</h3>\n              <h4>Sin #1. Intolerance</h4>\n              <p>Not too long ago, intolerance meant rejecting or even persecuting \n                practitioners of other religions. Not any more. Now, intolerance \n                means questioning the validity of any aspect of another's religion. \n                To the majority of Americans below fifty today, <b>questioning \n                the truthfulness of another's religious views is intolerant and \n                morally offensive</b>. This prohibition against differing with \n                other's viewpoints is postmodern. </p>\n              <h4>One Exception</h4>\n              <p>Strangely, it turns out that one exception is allowed to this \n                universal prohibition against intolerance. For some reason, it's \n                okay to question and even denounce religious views when dealing \n                with what is pejoratively labeled \"fundamentalism.\" \n                Today, when people refer to \"fundamentalists\" they no \n                longer mean just religious extremists like the Shiites waging \n                holy war against the West. Today, <b>fundamentalism may refer \n                to anyone who claims to know truth or who charges another religion \n                with falsehood</b>. Fundamentalists are in the wrong because they \n                subscribe to universal truth claims (metanarratives), and are \n                therefore \"totalistic,\" or \"logocentric,\" \n                in their thinking. </p>\n              <h4>Sin #2. Objectivity</h4>\n              <p>Postmodernists argue that modernists use reason to exclude people. \n                When people apply reason to religion, before long, someone's reality \n                is being branded \"false.\" This is not inclusive, and \n                it is also harsh and naive, because: \n              </p><ul>\n                <li>First, questioning another's beliefs implies that we can refer \n                  to an external objective reality, when in fact, reality is a \n                  social construct. By trying to apply rationality to religion, \n                  we are really trying to impose enlightenment European culture \n                  onto others. </li>\n                <li>Also, by challenging the truth claims of another's religion, \n                  we devalue the person who is the source of his or her own truth. \n                </li>\n              </ul>\n              <p>Thus, under the banner of inclusiveness postmodern thinkers actually \n                include all but one group-- those of us who are committed to biblical \n                authority. According to postmodernists, fundamentalists are those \n                who believe religious teachings are true or false, not just within \n                their own paradigm, but over all paradigms. \"Fundamentalists\" \n                view religious truth as objectively true, and therefore subject \n                to rational scrutiny. Evangelicals certainly fall within this \n                circle because we believe that if something is true, its opposite \n                cannot be true at the same time, regardless of what paradigm a \n                person holds.</p>\n              <h2>Postmodernism and Eastern Mysticism<br>\n                Borrowing or Coincidence?</h2>\n              <p>Observers of religion are aware of an intrinsic relativism in \n                eastern mystical traditions such as Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism. \n                As Monistic faiths, these religions teach that everything is part \n                of one essence. All these traditions not only <b>reject reason \n                as tool for discovering truth</b>, they even utilize contradiction \n                on the rational level to drive learners to a deeper or higher \n                plane of understanding. For instance, Buddhism describes the Tao \n                as the sound of one hand clapping. The Hindu Brahman is \"always \n                and never.\" Such paradoxical thinking, with its rejection \n                of rationality, is naturally compatible with postmodernism. </p>\n              <p>Also, <b>neither eastern religion nor postmodernism accept the \n                reality of the world </b>we observe in an objective sense. In \n                Hinduism, the material world is <i>Maya</i>, which means <i>illusion</i>. \n                What seems real to us (the material world) is an illusion. We \n                have already seen how postmodernism holds that reality is a social \n                construct. </p>\n              <p>Although it is tempting to think these two outlooks have borrowed, \n                one from the other, this is apparently not the case. Instead, \n                they are <b>compatible outlooks which have made common cause </b>in \n                popular culture, often blended with native spiritualities and \n                New Age consciousness. Remember, tribal nature religions also \n                make no use of reason in their paths to knowledge of the world. \n                These religions rely on tradition and intuition for know spiritual \n                things, none of which can be tested in any way by reason. </p>\n              <p>Other contemporary movements have proven to be compatible with \n                postmodernism as well. Some aspects of the recovery movement are \n                strongly suggestive of postmodern thought. </p>\n              <p>What do we suggest when we urge group members to give themselves \n                to \"God as you understand him\" or to their \"higher \n                power?\" Ultimately such vague and subjective formulas suggest \n                that the <i>content</i> of belief is irrelevant. A higher power \n                could be the God of the Bible, but it could also be anything from \n                the recovery group itself (which is often encouraged) to a New \n                Age concept of \"the god within\" to the gods of Buddhism. \n                [AA's cofounder, Bill W., states, \" . . .the designation \n                'God' [does not] refer to a particular being, force or concept, \n                but only to 'God' as each of us understands that term.\" <i>AlAnon's \n                Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions,</i> (New York: Al-Anon Family \n                Group Headquarters, 1981) p. ix. Alcoholics Anonymous doctrine \n                also teaches explicitly that the support group can act as one's \n                \"higher power.\" See <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions,</i> \n                p. 25.] </p>\n              <p>People might have a religious experience with such a higher power, \n                but <b>one thing is discounted: The importance of propositional \n                truth.</b> Or, to put it differently, postmodern worshipers are \n                like postmodern readers; they are the <i>source</i> of truth, \n                not the <i>discoverers</i> of truth. </p>\n              <p>The literature of the recovery movement teaches that it is inappropriate \n                to question another person's higher power, because recovery is \n                tied to their belief in the power of the God of their understanding. \n                When you think about it, Twelve Step spirituality is distinctly \n                postmodern in the way <i>personal interpretation or experience</i> \n                and <i>personal empowerment</i> are substituted for truth about \n                God.</p>\n              <h3>Consciousness and Reality</h3>\n              <p>Postmodern thought also dovetails neatly another feature of New \n                Age Consciousness: The way consciousness can create or alter reality. \n                In New Age religion, mental imaging can create new realities, \n                not unlike the way affirmative postmodernists hope to create new \n                realities. Although New Age thinkers have not thus far demonstrated \n                the fascination with political power seen in postmodern circles, \n                they also favor oppressed tribal peoples as more pure than western \n                culture.</p>\n              <h3>Experience and Authority in Religion</h3>\n              <p>Of the several religious leaders we profile in <i>The Death of \n                Truth, </i>most explicitly say that personal experience is the \n                key to understanding religion. Most also call for <b>dissociation \n                </b>as a preface to the religious experience. Dissociation is \n                the loss of conscious awareness of the real world. Specifically, \n                postmodern religionists call for people to <b>leave all rational \n                categories behind </b>before ascending to the godhead. Thus, they \n                see one thing as the supreme barrier to deep religion: Reason, \n                and its handmaiden, truth. </p>\n              <p>Whether it's Joseph Campbell, John Bradshaw or Fredrick Turner, \n                all agree that we must first take leave of our senses before trying \n                to know spiritual things. How similar they are to some calls within \n                the evangelical church!</p>\n              <h3>The Rest of the Story</h3>\n              <h5>In The <b><i>Death of Truth</i></b>, our chapters on Religion \n                and Evangelical Imperatives, and Practical Communication Ideas \n                cover:</h5>\n              <ul>\n                <li>How specific leading postmodern religionists think in their \n                  own words </li>\n                <li>How postmodernism has also crept into the evangelical church \n                </li>\n                <li>Practical ways we can communicate with our postmodern culture \n                  without losing our grip on truth </li>\n              </ul>\n              <p>Copyright &#xA9; 1996 Xenos Christian Fellowship. <br>\n                All Rights Reserved.</p>\n              <p><small><small><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Send \n                the contributors a comment or question.</a> <br>\n                <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/pmandyou.htm\">Return to the previous page</a></small></small> \n            </p></td>\n            </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Postmodernism and You: Religion","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/dotrel.htm"}

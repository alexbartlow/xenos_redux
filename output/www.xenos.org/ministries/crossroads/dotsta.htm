No book can take \n          you more quickly and painlessly into the heart of the new postmodern \n          outlook than <i>The Death of Truth</i>. You will feel the lights going \n          on time after time as you read this easy-to-understand volume </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>This Study Guide is designed to help groups discuss the book section \n          by section as members read through it on their own. Each week, appoint \n          one discussion facilitator. The facilitator needs to carefully read \n          the section in<i> The Death of Truth</i> for that week, and look over \n          the discussion questions and suggested answers in the facilitator's \n          guide ahead of time in order to offer leading thoughts. For each week, \n          we have provided more material than you will likely be able to cover. \n          Therefore, the facilitator should select the questions for study each \n          weak. Avoid lecture, except for short 2 to 3 minute explanations or \n          transitions. If people discuss and struggle with these concepts they \n          will feel more satisfaction and depth in their learning. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>Encourage every participant to buy his or her own copy of <i>The Death \n          of Truth</i>, (couples can share) and to bring them to your meetings. \n          <i>The Death of Truth</i> is published by Bethany House Publishers, \n          and is available through any bookstore, especially Christian bookstores. \n          Discounted copies are also available from our Worldwide Web Site at \n          http://www.crossrds.org. When the guide says to read a section from \n          the book, ask one of the members to read aloud, while the others follow \n          along. Reading is an easy way to help start people speaking and participating. \n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>As written, this study could take 15 to 20 weeks to complete. If you \n          want to shorten the number of weeks, we recommend skipping some of the \n          \"Postmodern Impact\" chapters. We do not recommend skipping \n          the first three or the last two chapters. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>We have arranged each week's study so you can copy the \"Discussion \n          Guide\" for your group members while giving only the facilitator \n          the \"Facilitator's guide\" which includes suggested answers. \n          Questions asking only for personal opinion have been left without suggested \n          answers. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>The entire discussion guide is copyrighted, but you may copy it for \n          non-commercial study purposes provided you copy and distribute at least \n          whole weekly sections unaltered, and give credit to the authors. You \n          may also get a <b>FREE</b> copy of the guide on-line for use in your \n          word processor at our Worldwide Web Site. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      \n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/dotstb.htm\">Read on to the next section of the Study Guide</a> \n      </p>\n      <p><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">Send a comment \n        to Dennis</a> </p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/dotstsec.htm\">Return to the Table of Contents page</a> </p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/dotstopt.htm\">Return to the Download Options page</a> </p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/dot.htm\">Return to the Death of Truth page</a> </p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/index.htm\">Return to the Crossroads Project</a> </p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to the Xenos home page</a> \n    </p></td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Death of Truth Group Study Guide - Introduction: Learn about the shift from modernism to postmodernism and its implications.","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/dotsta.htm"}

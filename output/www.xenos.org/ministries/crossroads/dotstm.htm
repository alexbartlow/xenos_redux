When postmodernists use the term, a paradigm is a model within \n          which one set of truths hold. Other paradigms have their own sets of \n          truths. In other words, a paradigm is similar to the idea of a cultural \n          \"reality\" or, to use terminology from literary theory, a paradigm \n          is similar to a social \"text\" or \"story.\" However, \n          postmodernists aren't the only ones who use the term paradigm. How might \n          people use the term paradigm without loading it with postmodern ideology? \n        </li>\n      </ul><blockquote> \n        <p>- Before postmodernism, a paradigm was a model, or a way of approaching \n          an area of thought. For instance, people who believed the world was \n          flat, had a collection of reasons for that belief, and found it difficult \n          to accept evidence that the world was round. After all, the horizon \n          on the ocean was flat, water didn't run off the surface of the world, \n          etc. After the world was shown to be round, these people experienced \n          a paradigm shift--they had to change not only the way they viewed the \n          world from flat to round, but also all the associated factors they earlier \n          thought demonstrated the flatness of the world. Note that this does \n          not suggest that the world really was flat for them--in fact the real \n          world was always round. But to postmodernists, paradigms are reality. \n          We cannot speak of a \"real\" world out there. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul><li>Dr. Campbell names several features used in scientific research intended \n          to reduce bias and enhance objectivity. He included replication, blind \n          testing, peer review and falsifiability. Do you think these aspects \n          of research promise that scientific research will be relatively objective? \n          How might each fail to do what it was intended to do? </li>\n      </ul><blockquote> \n        <p>- Replication could fail because the other research team produce the \n          same results, but accept the interpretation on those results suggested \n          by the first researcher. Later, it may be proven that while the results \n          were valid the interpretation was wrong. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Blind testing could demonstrate a true correlation between one thing \n          and another, but still fail to reveal the true cause and effect relationship \n          between them. Just because we show that two things are statistically \n          correlated, does not mean we have demonstrated what is the cause and \n          what is the effect. Blind testing eliminates researcher bias, but cannot \n          fix an improperly structured experiment. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Peer review can fail because other scientists may be locked into \n          a paradigm that causes them to exclude contradictory information. For \n          instance, stomach ulcers have only recently been shown to be the result \n          of bacterial infection. For decades scientists have missed this fact \n          in unison. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Some correct findings cannot be falsified, and some false conclusions \n          cannot be demonstrated as false either. Particularly in more theoretical \n          fields of study, conclusions are arrived at inductively, and are only \n          accepted as the most probable conclusion. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul><li>Dr. Campbell says, \"This is a contradiction within modernism: \n          Their conclusions are supposed to be based on reason and observation, \n          not on faith.

How do you know the data of your senses corresponds to the \"real\" \n          world? </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>2. How do you know cause and effect and natural laws operate the same \n          way in all parts of the universe? </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>3. If cause and effect in a closed system accounts for everything, \n          what caused the big bang? If you don't know, isn't your belief that \n          cause and effect accounts for everything based on blind faith? </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>Think of some more if you can. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul><li>Dr. Campbell quotes Renee Weber when she says, \"Science as it \n          is used in this book stands for the attitude of Einstein rather than \n          of Bacon: an attitude of kinship with nature rather than of exploitive \n          power over her.\" Can you think of any movies or books that have \n          portrayed science as primarily an exploiter and destroyer of nature? \n        </li>\n      </ul><blockquote> \n        <p>- Go to a video or book store and browse the most popular rentals or \n          books for examples here. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul><li>In this chapter, Dr. Feyerabend suggests that science has no more \n          legitimacy or authority than other approached to reality, like magic. \n          How would you respond to such a claim? </li>\n      </ul><blockquote> \n        <p>- Magic explains disease as a symptom of spirit possession or cursing. \n          Medical science can heal many of the same diseases magic is helpless \n          to heal. Life expectancy has more than doubled in areas where magic \n          healing has been replaced by medical science. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- The same people who claim science has never done anything better \n          than magic fly planes, drive cars, and write their anti-scientific books \n          on computers while listening to their radios! </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>Think of more examples if you can. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/dotstn.htm\">Read onto the next section of the study guide</a> \n      </p>\n      <p><a href=\"mailto:McCallumD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org&amp;subject=crossroads\">Send \n        a comment to Dennis</a> </p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/dotstsec.htm\">Return to the Table of Contents page</a> </p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/dotstopt.htm\">Return to the Download Options page</a> </p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/dot.htm\">Return to the Death of Truth page</a> </p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/index.htm\">Return to the Crossroads Project</a> </p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to the Xenos home page</a> \n    </p></td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Death of Truth Group Study Guide - Chapter 11","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/dotstm.htm"}

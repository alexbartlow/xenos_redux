No book can take \n          you more quickly and painlessly into the heart of the new postmodern \n          outlook than <i>The Death of Truth</i>. You will feel the lights going \n          on time after time as you read this easy-to-understand volume </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>This Study Guide is designed to help groups discuss the book section \n          by section as members read through it on their own. Each week, appoint \n          one discussion facilitator. The facilitator needs to carefully read \n          the section in<i> The Death of Truth</i> for that week, and look over \n          the discussion questions and suggested answers in the facilitator's \n          guide ahead of time in order to offer leading thoughts. For each week, \n          we have provided more material than you will likely be able to cover. \n          Therefore, the facilitator should select the questions for study each \n          weak. Avoid lecture, except for short 2 to 3 minute explanations or \n          transitions. If people discuss and struggle with these concepts they \n          will feel more satisfaction and depth in their learning. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>Encourage every participant to buy his or her own copy of <i>The Death \n          of Truth</i>, (couples can share) and to bring them to your meetings. \n          <i>The Death of Truth</i> is published by Bethany House Publishers, \n          and is available through any bookstore, especially Christian bookstores. \n          Discounted copies are also available from our Worldwide Web Site at \n          http://www.crossrds.org. When the guide says to read a section from \n          the book, ask one of the members to read aloud, while the others follow \n          along. Reading is an easy way to help start people speaking and participating. \n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>As written, this study could take 15 to 20 weeks to complete.

A key underlying assumption of postmodernism \n          is how they conceive <b>human nature</b>. While modernists viewed people \n          as autonomous (and capable of independent rational thought), postmodernists \n          see human identity and thinking as the product of culture. Leffel states, \n          \"postmodernists deny we have a \"self\" that exists independent \n          of our social reality. Culture and society <i>create</i> individuals \n          as well as all their thoughts and attitudes.\" The following quote \n          is by Peter Berger, whose analysis is often cited by postmodernists: \n          <br>\n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>\"A thought of any kind is grounded in society . . . The individual, \n          then, derives his world view socially in very much the same way that \n          he derives his roles and his identity. In other words, his emotions \n          and his self-interpretation like his actions are predefined for him \n          by society, and so is his cognitive approach to the universe that surrounds \n          him.\" </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>If \"a thought of any kind is grounded in society,\" certain \n          important implications follow. These implications are widely accepted \n          in today's postmodern influenced social sciences and in popular cultural. \n          What are these implications? </li>\n        <li>Leffel says, \"one of the main ways society shapes individuals \n          is through language.\" This is probably the most abstract and difficult \n          parts of the postmodern argument. Postmodernists point out that individuals \n          always interact with reality through the medium of language. All mental \n          activities, they say, are based in language. We think in words. We communicate \n          with words. People are connected to reality through the labels they \n          assign to their perceptions and ideas. These labels, or words, are arbitrary, \n          and evolve in society. The more abstract (and often more important) \n          our ideas are, the more dependent we are on words alone to provide meaning. \n          But if language is the way people relate to reality, then we must understand \n          the nature of language. </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>Let's think about the components of <b>language</b> that postmodernists \n          say makes objectivity impossible: </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li><i>Semantics</i>--the meaning of words and phrases. Postmodernists \n          say that, since societies define words, and our thinking is rooted in \n          language, we can't go beyond a culturally relative way of knowing. Knowledge \n          claims themselves are just a matter of cultural conditioning. Can you \n          think of any evidence that knowledge is not necessarily limited to a \n          given culture? </li>\n        <li><i>Syntax</i>--the structure or logic of language. Postmodernists \n          say that every language has a structure, or logic. Words are related \n          to each other by connective words such as \"if/ then,\" \"and,\" \n          \"either/or\" and so on. Postmodernists say that the linguistic \n          constructions for the West promote a hierarchical, \"either/or\" \n          way of thinking. The language of science, logic, and progress shape \n          the way we think. That's why we don't think <i>holistically</i> and \n          <i>inclusively</i>. Have you heard this kind of idea before? Where? \n        </li>\n        <li>Do you think there is a link between the postmodern view of language \n          and the demands of \"political correctness\"? </li>\n        <li>Do you think there are broader implications to the postmodern view \n          that language shapes thought? </li>\n        <li>Do you think language controls what you think? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h5>Problems with postmodern analysis:</h5>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>Postmodernists rightly critique the modernists' overconfidence in autonomous \n          human reason. However, Leffel argues that they've thrown out the baby \n          with the bath water. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>They critique the correspondence view of truth. Postmodernists hold \n          that all knowledge claims are arbitrary, and that none are ultimately \n          more objective than another because we lack <i>certainty</i>. On a practical \n          level, what's wrong with this critique? </li>\n        <li>Imagine this discussion:<br>\n          \"There is no such thing as truth\"<br>\n          \"Really, is that true?\" <br>\n          \"Yes it is\"<br>\n          \"Well if that's true than there's at least one true thing--your \n          statement! So that means it's not true that there's no such thing as \n          truth.\"<br>\n          \"But my statement is that there is no such thing as truth.\" \n          <br>\n          \"Okay, but then your statement isn't true, is it?\"<br>\n          <br>\n          This conversation sounds absurd, and it is. Is the dialog between Christians \n          and postmodernists the same or different than this discussion </li>\n        <li>Postmodernists say all thought and reason is shaped by language. But \n          as Leffel points out, this is inconsistent with some things we know \n          about psychological development and the development of language. Leffel \n          cites authorities who show that the mind is active and makes clear rational \n          distinctions <i>prior to the acquisition of language</i>. How do these \n          findings impact that postmodern view of linguistic cultural determinism? \n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      \n      <h2>Chapter 4 <br>\n        Postmodernism and \"The Myth of Progress\": Two Visions </h2>\n      <h3>Discussion Guide for Two Visions</h3>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>This chapter makes the distinction between two types of postmodernism: \n          skeptical and affirmative. Both types of postmodernism reject the possibility \n          of rational objectivity.

Among \n          the examples Leffel cites are: so-called \"Manifest Destiny\" \n          and the alleged inferiority of African Americans. These are example \n          of what postmodernists call \"epistemological tyranny.\" </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>What does \"epistemological tyranny\" mean?

We just \n          label people \"homophobes\" if they have problems with the ethics \n          of homosexuality. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Where and to what extent do you see constructivism in the university \n          today?

What does she mean by this? What are the implications \n          of her view? </li>\n        <li>According to the TV news program, \"Day One\" (8/22/95), thousands \n          of people contracted a disease called EMS from contaminants in the health-food \n          product L-tryptophan--an herbal product. There is as yet no cure for \n          this painful disease which to date has led to 36 deaths. Dr. O'Math&#xFA;na \n          predicts we will hear more stories like this if postmodern ideas are \n          used to promote medical products and procedures. Why might he think \n          this? </li>\n        <li>Dr. O'Math&#xFA;na argues against using anecdotal evidence and personal \n          experience as a way to validate medical treatments. What is the difference \n          between what he is critiquing and simply getting advice from others \n          based on their experiences (which he would recommend doing, especially \n          in medical matters)? </li>\n        <li>Some people who practice therapeutic touch claim that God is their \n          source of healing, not <i>prana</i>. Thus, they see no problems with \n          Christians practicing therapeutic touch.

Many others place great emphasis on intuition. For \n          example, Engebretson and Wardell state, \"The patient should be \n          encouraged to trust her or his own intuition and judgment\" about \n          alternative healing methods and practitioners (<i>Nurse Practitioner</i> \n          18 (1993): 51-5).

This organization \n          wants to help people have the latter outcome. People experience these \n          crises after starting meditation or any practice which brings them \"into \n          more direct and conscious relationship to their own life force, or <i>prana</i> \n          in Sanskrit\" (Emma Bragdon, <i>The Call of Spiritual Emergency</i>, \n          Harper &amp; Row, 1990, p. 5).

Teachers occasionally believe that some \n          students do not care if they do well in school, and that these students \n          are not properly prepared to succeed in an academic environment and \n          are not motivated to learn. The cultural deficit model as described \n          by Sleeter and Grant (1990) assumes that schools should change learners, \n          should help them assimilate to mainstream culture, including the \"culture \n          of science.\" From this viewpoint, children need remedial work to \n          compensate for their lack of knowledge, skills, and attitudes in science \n          and mathematics. Those who advocate the use of this world view regard \n          students as being \"at risk\" when they do not share American \n          mainstream language and culture.

A 'multicultural approach to \n          education promotes cultural pluralism and social equality by reforming \n          the school program for all students to make it reflect diversity.' If \n          one adopts this world view, children who speak a primary language other \n          than English are considered an asset in the classroom because they have \n          constructed a knowledge of science in a different sociocultural context \n          than others in the class and thus bring added resources to the classroom. \n          Those who advocate the use of a multicultural approach to education \n          see diversity as a strength in the classroom, as a vehicle for increasing \n          the learning of all students. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>What postmodern theories and attitudes are evident in this passage? \n        </li>\n        <li>Is it true that sometimes, or all the time, that students do not succeed \n          because of differences between their culture and \"school culture\"? \n          Are there other reasons for why some students might not succeed? </li>\n        <li>For someone who does not believe that the schools should \"change \n          learners,\" what, then, would the school's job be?

What passages of scripture directly \n          reject his view? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Several passages are relevant. Perhaps none more than this: </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- \"We did not follow cleverly invented stories [GK <i>muthos </i>= \n          myths] when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus \n          Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.\" (2 Peter 1:16) \n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- see also I Corinthians 15:1-19. Go through the passage and identify \n          the statements that lay stress on the importance of the actual historicity \n          of Christ's death. Does this passage allow in any way for a metaphorical \n          or mythical understanding of the resurrection? </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      \n      <h3>Feminist Spirituality</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>The authors make a distinction between the legitimate concerns of \n          women in a rapidly changing culture and the ideological position taken \n          by feminists. Can you see how the legitimate concerns of women (or any \n          other definable social group) is different from a militant ideological \n          point of view? How is feminism different from the concerns of women? \n        </li>\n        <li>Clearly, feminism is a type of affirmative postmodernism. The ideological \n          approach to truth is clear in all of feminist literature, especially \n          among feminist theologians. They start from the perspective of what \n          they conceive to be \"women's experience.\" Read the following \n          quotes from the chapter: </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>\"By women's experience as a key to hermeneutics or theory of interpretation, \n          we mean precisely that experience which arises when women become critically \n          aware of these falsifying and alienating experiences imposed upon them \n          as women by a male-dominated culture.\" </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>\"All women live with male violence . . .\" </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Do you think that this is an appropriate place to begin forming an \n          approach to reading the Bible? Why, or Why not? </li>\n        <li>Read the following quote carefully. What implications do you find \n          in the statement? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>\"Whatever contradicts those convictions [arising from women's \n          experience] cannot be accepted as having the authority of an authentic \n          revelation of truth. It is simply a matter of there being no turning \n          back. We can be dispossessed of our best insights, proven wrong in our \n          judgments. But as long as those insights continue to make sense to us, \n          and as long as our basic judgments seem to us incontrovertible, there \n          can be no turning back. So it is with feminist consciousness and the \n          interpretation of scripture.\" </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>What do you think of the feminist discussion of Genesis 2:22-24 (the \n          creation of Eve out of Adam)? Does it justify male violence against \n          women, as feminist theologians argue? </li>\n      </ul>\n      \n      <h2>John Bradshaw</h2>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Bradshaw is the high priest of the inner child movement in popular \n          psychology. Do any members of the group feel they have benefited from \n          this school? </li>\n        <li>What do you think of Bradshaw's loathing for so-called \"patriarchy?\" \n          Do you see evidence that people lose their ability to direct themselves \n          because they were raised under patriarchy? </li>\n        <li>If my inner child is the true me, and I am \"championing my inner \n          child,\" is this the same, or different than championing me? </li>\n        <li>What do you think of entering the mindless state Bradshaw calls \"the \n          silence?\" Have you ever done this in connection with religion, \n          or have you seen others do so? </li>\n        <li>The Bible teaches that meditation is good in passages like Psalms \n          1. What difference, if any, do you see between biblical meditation and \n          the sort of meditation Bradshaw advances? </li>\n      </ul>\n      \n      <h2>Frederick Turner</h2>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Read the section on Turner first. </li>\n        <li>The authors claim, \"Like some even in the evangelical camp today, \n          Turner discounts the importance of truth and theology in favor of ritualistic \n          experience.\" Have you seen this? Do you think the contemporary \n          churches are more, or less ritualistic than the New Testament church? \n        </li>\n        <li>What do you think of Turner's suggestion that ritual does not need \n          to be linked to any particular truth? Are you aware of any similarity \n          in the ritual of different religions? </li>\n        <li>Could you see people from different religions coming together based \n          on ritual? </li>\n      </ul>\n      \n      <h2>Chapter 14 <br>\n        Evangelical Imperatives</h2>\n      <h3>Discussion Guide</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Again, this section is important for Christians, so we have more than \n          one week planned. </li>\n      </ul>\n      \n      <h3>Week 1: Accommodation Temptation</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>In the first two sections of this chapter, McCallum claims Christians \n          today are being tempted to down-play the absolute nature of truth because \n          it is unpopular. Have you seen any evidence of this? </li>\n        <li>Go over each of the following examples cited by McCallum, and say \n          whether you have seen evidence of postmodern tendencies among evangelical \n          Christians in that area.

What does the Bible teach on each? </li>\n        <li>&#xA8; Excessive reliance or hope placed in evangelical political power \n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      &#xA0;</td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Death of Truth Group Study Guide","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/dotstds.htm"}

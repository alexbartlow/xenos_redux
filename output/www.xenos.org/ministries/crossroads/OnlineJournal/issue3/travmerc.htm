The difference \n                is between being able to say, as the final line in her struggle \n                of coming to Jesus, \"F--- it, I quit...You can come in.\" \n                (dashes mine)</p>\n              <p>Mercies is brutally honest to the \n                point of making you squirm. But that is exactly why I love it \n                so much. Her story is as human as the Old Testament characters, \n                complete with confusion, failings, back-talk to God, despair and \n                the ultimate triumph of spiritual growth. Just the way God would \n                want it.</p>\n              <p>A white intellectual from a San Francisco \n                hippie-culture family (which hated everything having to do with \n                Christianity), early in Lamott's life she ends up a beaten down \n                alcoholic on the fast-track to self-destruction.</p>\n              <p>In the retrospective look at her \n                conversion, she saw the discord of her family and found solace \n                in the love and stability of friends' families with \"religious\" \n                parents from a wide variety of faiths:</p>\n              <p>\"My coming to faith did not \n                start with a leap but rather a series of staggers from one safe \n                place to another.....When I look back at some of these early resting \n                places - the boisterous home of the Catholics, the soft armchair \n                of the Christian Science mom, adoption by ardent Jews - I can \n                see how flimsy and indirect a path they made. Yet each step brought \n                me closer to the verdant pad of faith on which I somehow stay \n                afloat today.\"</p>\n              <p>After an incredible roller-coaster \n                ride of God loving, pursuing and meeting someone on their own \n                terms, she comes to Christ after visiting a predominantly black \n                church. At first she came for the music, but eventually stayed \n                for the message.</p>\n              <p>What's most interesting to me is \n                without prompting from churchgoers, Lamott engages in a fierce \n                internal battle with trusting God with her life. Though it would \n                seem so much easier to just sit in church forever and enjoy the \n                music and people, while holding to a mishmash of spirituality, \n                she somehow knows she needs to make a choice. She knows she needs \n                to convert <em>from</em> something, <em>to</em> something.</p>\n              <p>(Thus debunks any criticism that \n                this book is light and fluffy reflections on faith, with no teeth \n                to it. One thing is for sure, this book has bite.)</p>\n              <p>For the rest of the book, we follow \n                her through her fledgling Christian years, agonizing and growing \n                with her as she tackles tough questions. What about God and the \n                problem of evil? Why do bad things happen to good people? Where \n                is God when it hurts?</p>\n              <p>All of these issues are addressed \n                without really being addressed. I know that may not make sense, \n                but that's precisely the brilliance of Lamott's style. The hard \n                questions are weaved throughout anecdotes and reflections; real \n                life we can all relate to, without pulling any punches whatsoever, \n                such as this thought on grief at the recent death of her bestfriend \n                from breast cancer:</p>\n              <p>\"Grief, as I read somewhere \n                once, is a lazy Susan. One day it is heavy and underwater, and \n                the next day it spins and stops at loud and rageful, and the next \n                day at wounded keening, and the next day numbness, silence. I \n                was hoarse for the first six weeks after Pammy died and myromance \n                ended, from shouting in the car and crying, and I had blisters \n                on the palm of one hand from hitting the bed with my tennis racket, \n                bellowing in pain and anger.\"</p>\n              <p>However, humor and pointed thoughts \n                like this one, found in a chapter titled Grace, are right around \n                the corner:</p>\n              <p>\"(Failure) breaks through all \n                that held breath and isometric tension about needing to look good: \n                it's the gift of feeling floppier.\"</p>\n              <p>And this this little gem on prayer \n                found in a chapter about consulting friends on a decision whether \n                or not to let her seven-year-old on a tandem hang-glider with \n                an instructor who offered a flight:</p>\n              <p>\"Half said I should let Sam \n                go, half acted as if I were considering buying Sam a chain saw \n                for his birthday. But all the ones who believe in God told me \n                to pray, so I did. Here are the two best prayers I know: 'Help \n                me, Help me, Help me,' and 'Thank you, Thank you, Thank You.' \n                A woman I know says, for her morning prayer, 'Whatever,' and then \n                for the evening,'Oh, well,' but has conceded that these prayers \n                are more palatable for people without children.\"</p>\n              <p>Lammot's style is to simply speak \n                in a one-sided, self-absorbed conversation about her life and \n                experiences, a very difficult style to pull off because it generally \n                prompts the reader to wonder, \"why should I care?\"</p>\n              <p>But we do care. And I dare you to \n                get through the chapter Knocking on Heaven's Door without convulsive \n                laughter, or the part about the woman who hugs the man dying of \n                Aids, and not be shaken to the bone at the power of God and the \n                triumph of love. </p>\n              <p>I would highly recommend this book \n                to anyone, of any race, creed or religion. It brings up ideas \n                especially suited for hashing out withfriends in a \"book \n                club\" setting.</p>\n              <p>And for the individual reader, if \n                you are like me: a struggler, a skeptic, prone to failure, weak \n                and fearful, preferring to take your rough medicine of life with \n                a touch of humor, you will not be able to get enough.</p>\n              <p>Copyright &#xA9; 2000 Dave Schwier\n            </p></td>\n          </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Traveling Mercies reviewed by Dave Schwier","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/travmerc.htm"}

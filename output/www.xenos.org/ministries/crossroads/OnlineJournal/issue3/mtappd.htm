He argues that the exodus showed \n                      the nations YHWH&#x92;s superiority over their so-called \n                      gods and showed Israel God&#x92;s role as their redeemer \n                      shepherd. This conclusion is not novel relative to the conclusion \n                      drawn by Moses and Miriam, however (Ex.15:11).</p>\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    <p>Psalm 78:9-72 \n                      is a prolonged recollection of rebellious Israel and merciful \n                      God the history is not chronological and extends past the \n                      exodus to David&#x92;s monarchy. This chain reference approach \n                      to argumentation might be termed <i>midrash</i> by some \n                      scholars if it appeared in the New Testament and yet it \n                      predates <i>midrash</i>.</p>\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    <p>Ps.81:7 Asaph \n                      indicates that Meribah was God&#x92;s test of Israel (c.f. \n                      Nu.20:1-14); Ps.95:8-11 indicates that Israel tested God \n                      at Meribah; Ps.106:32-33 indicates that Israel rebelled \n                      against God&#x92;s Spirit there. The Psalms do not add to \n                      the account in Numbers, they simply apply the lesson&#x92;s \n                      learned there to their own audience.</p>\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    <p>Psalm 114 The \n                      exodus of Israel was the beginning of her theocracy and \n                      the onset of God&#x92;s dwelling with Israel (i.e. \"Judah, \n                      God&#x92;s sanctuary\"). It seem possible that this \n                      is a reference to the Noaic prophecy that God would dwell \n                      in the tents of Shem (Gen.9:27).<sup><a name=\"Ref1\"> </a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtappd.htm#Note1\">[1]</a></sup> \n                      If so, then something new is being said here, that the onset \n                      of this promise began at the exodus.</p>\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    <p>Psalm 136:10-22 \n                      The exodus &amp; wilderness experience demonstrated is unchanging \n                      lovingkindness toward Israel.</p>\n                  </li>\n                </ul>\n              </blockquote>\n              \n              <blockquote> \n                <ul>\n                  <li>\n                    <p>Ps.80:8-11 \n                      (Ps.72:8) indicates borders for Israel that match the promise \n                      to Israel through Moses (c.f.

There&#x92;s \n                      not a direct reference to the event in the Psalm. It is \n                      an application derived from the event &#x96; that God delivers \n                      his loved ones.</p>\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    <p>Psalm 51 &#x96; \n                      This is a psalm of David when Nathan rebuked him after he \n                      had committed adultery with Bathsheba. There&#x92;s not \n                      a direct reference to the event in the Psalm. It does contain \n                      applications derived from the event: 1. that only God can \n                      pardon sin, 2. that all sin is, ultimately, against God, \n                      3. that only God can restore &amp; 4. that repentance is \n                      more important than religious activity. It also contains \n                      petitions for mercy &amp; forgiveness. Verse 11 may be David&#x92;s \n                      application of the downfall of Saul to his own situation \n                      through historical analogy. At the rebuke of Nathan he must \n                      have thought back to Saul who was cast aside for rejecting \n                      the will of God (1Sam.13:14; 15:10,22-23; 16:14-23). Now, \n                      David had &#x91;despised the word of the Lord&#x92; (2 Sam. \n                      12:9,10,14) what would God do? Also, verse 18 seems to correlate \n                      the welfare of Israel with the moral righteousness of the \n                      king. This may be an application of 2 Sam. 24.</p>\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    <p>Psalm 52 &#x96; \n                      This is a psalm of David when Doeg the Edomite told Saul \n                      where David had fled (c.f. 1Sam.21:7 &amp; 22:9-19) resulting \n                      in the deaths of the priests. There&#x92;s not a direct \n                      reference to the event in the Psalm. There are some applications \n                      derived from the event &#x96; that God will destroy the \n                      wicked and deliver the righteous. </p>\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    <p>Psalm 54 &#x96; \n                      This is a psalm of David when the Ziphites revealed David \n                      was hiding amongst the people (c.f. 1Sam.23:19 &amp; 26:1) \n                      resulting in Saul&#x92;s effort to find &amp; kill him. \n                      There&#x92;s not a direct reference to the event in the \n                      Psalm.

I will assume, in most cases, that the superscript \n                or postscript information associated with a Psalm is legitimate. \n                Some historical superscripts seem unsubstantiated by the content \n                of the psalm that follows (e.g. 34). It's not clear whether this \n                is because titles were speculative additions to the psalm, whether \n                the psalms are generalized principles relevant to the historical \n                antecedent or whether, as some argue, the superscripts are really \n                subscripts for the previous psalm. In most cases, however, these \n                sidebar comments are very ancient. According to Anderson these \n                are not only found, \"&#x85; in MT, Qumran, LXX, and Targums, \n                but it ought also to be noted that even by the time of the LXX \n                translation (2nd - 3rd century BC) the technical terms contained \n                there were so antiquated and obscure that the translators had \n                a fair degree of trouble interpreting them. This is true also \n                for the Targums. Furthermore, we find similar super/postscripts \n                in other parts of Scripture (cf. Hab 3:1, 19b; Isa 38:9). There \n                thus seems to be no reason not to take the super/postscripts seriously.\" \n                This type of material differs from other references to the Pentateuch \n                &amp; Former Prophets because ostensibly the author is reflecting \n                on the meaning of the events in his own personal history.<i> Return \n                to <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtappd.htm#Ref2\">Text.</a></i></p>\n              <p><sup><a name=\"Note3\">[3]</a></sup>Excepting \n                Psalm 60.<i> Return to <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtappd.htm#Ref3\">Text.</a></i></p>\n              <p><sup><a name=\"Note4\">[4]</a></sup>Psalm \n                40 has some additional interpretive difficulties because of the \n                use the author of Hebrews put to the LXX version of the passage \n                (c.f.

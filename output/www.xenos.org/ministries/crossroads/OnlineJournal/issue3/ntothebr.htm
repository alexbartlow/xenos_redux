In short, their hermeneutic \n              is based in their philosophy of history, and their philosophy of \n              history is teleological: history has a beginning, and it is moving \n              in a particular direction, toward a culmination. What things prior \n              to the time of Christ are primarily pointing toward, for NT authors, \n              is Jesus Christ himself. This can be seen in Christ&#x92;s words \n              in Luke 24:44: \"Now He said to them, \"These are My words \n              which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things \n              which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets \n              and the Psalms must be fulfilled.\" In other words, all portions \n              of the OT looked forward to Jesus. (That is, parts of each section; \n              Christ&#x92;s statement need not lead us to allegorize every event \n              in the OT into messianic prophecy.) History is \"filled up\" \n              in the person and ministry of Christ.<sup><a name=\"Ref1\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/ntothebr.htm#Note1\">[1]</a></sup> \n              <p>Certain principles can thus be observed. \n                First, the future is rooted in the past, but it is greater, more \n                expansive; the end of history is like the beginning of history, \n                but greater. In other words, history is a unified whole, a story \n                with a unified plot, and subsequent events are carrying forward \n                the same narrative. Furthermore, the same theology is operative, \n                and the same language describes it. In addition, the unity of \n                history is often demonstrated in both OT and NT texts by typological \n                correlations of different events. This enables us to say that \n                there is a canonical hermeneutic, and that it is exegetically \n                demonstrable. Prototypical events carry the theology forward into \n                God&#x92;s larger plan/program; without the earlier prototype, \n                the later events could not be understood. An important point, \n                then, for the NT writer and his view of \"fulfillment\" \n                is that the past is <i>incomplete</i>, and thus can be \"filled\" \n                by new revelation. </p>\n              <p>What such a view of history requires \n                is that we take a \"big picture\" view of the Bible and \n                its interpretation of itself. As Douglas Moo has pointed out, \n                we need to understand that the canon is \"the ultimate context \n                of meaning\" (p. 211). He says, \"The meaning intended \n                by the human author of a particular text can take on &#x91;fuller&#x92; \n                meaning, legitimately developed from his meaning, <i>in the light \n                of the text&#x92;s ultimate canonical context</i>\" (p. 210, \n                emphasis mine). What Moo calls a \"canonical approach\" \n                is to \"focus on the ultimate canonical context of any single \n                scriptural text as the basis on which to find a &#x91;fuller&#x92; \n                sense in that text than its human author may have been cognizant \n                of\" (p. 204). What this approach suggests is that \"any \n                specific biblical text can legitimately be interpreted in light \n                of its ultimate literary context&#x97;the whole canon, which receives \n                its unity from the single divine author of the whole\" (p. \n                205). Moo asserts that \"the use of the Old Testament in the \n                New cannot be understood without setting it in the framework of \n                the canon as witness to salvation history\" (p. 209). Furthermore, \n                in order properly to apply Moo&#x92;s insight, it is necessary \n                for us to realize that often the NT writer will quote a few verses \n                of a passage, intending that we make the connections with the \n                broader theological truths contained in the surrounding context. \n                As Richard Hays points out, \"Allusive echo functions to suggest \n                to the reader that text B should be understood in light of a broad \n                interplay with text A, encompassing aspects of A beyond those \n                explicitly echoed.\" Thus, we he calls \"metalepsis&#x85; \n                places the reader within a field of whispered or unstated correspondences\" \n                (Hays, p. 20). Further, Scriptural quotations and allusions \"usually \n                must be understood as allusive recollections of the wider narrative \n                setting from which they are taken\" (Hays, p. 157-58).</p>\n              <p>Thus, the most important point to \n                glean about analyzing NT writers use of the OT is that each OT \n                reference must be seen in its broader theological and historical \n                context, which is all of history and the whole of the OT, and \n                that even when only a phrase or a verse is referred to, it often \n                resonates with much deeper and broader meaning that can be discerned \n                only by understanding the broader historical, literary, and theological \n                context.</p>\n              <p>Another important point to realize, \n                and one which is especially pertinent for our study of the early \n                chapters of Hebrews, is that NT writers use OT texts in a wide \n                variety of ways. As we discussed above, these men were steeped \n                in the OT, and therefore it makes sense that they would have OT \n                quotes and allusions at their fingertips almost constantly. As \n                the thrust of Douglas Moo&#x92;s excellent essay makes clear, \n                different NT writers use the OT in a variety of ways, and even \n                individual writers will use the OT in different ways within the \n                same book. Thus, we make a grave mistake if we assume, for example, \n                that the writer of Hebrews is attempting the same thing with his \n                use of the OT that Matthew is doing when he speaks of Christ&#x92;s \n                actions or words \"fulfilling\" the OT. I think my analysis \n                will explain what I mean by this distinction.</p>\n              <p>I want to focus primarily on the \n                use of the Old Testament in the first two chapters of the book \n                of Hebrews. But in order to do an adequate job on that, we really \n                need to understand what the author of Hebrews is doing in especially \n                the first seven chapters of the book. Thus I will look at the \n                first seven chapters, but I will not be able to adequately analyze \n                chapters 3-7; I will merely consider their overall argument as \n                it is relevant for our understanding of the use of the OT in chapters \n                1-2.</p>\n              <p>The intent of the author of Hebrews \n                in his use of the OT in chapters 1-2 is seen in the very beginning \n                verses of this book, in 1:1-4: </p>\n              <blockquote> \n                <p>1 God, after He spoke long ago \n                  to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many \n                  ways,</p>\n                <p>2 in these last days has spoken \n                  to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through \n                  whom also He made the world.</p>\n                <p>3 And He is the radiance of His \n                  glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds \n                  all things by the word of His power. When He had made purification \n                  of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,</p>\n                <p>4 having become as much better \n                  than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than \n                  they.</p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>In effect, in its most boiled down \n                form, what the author of Hebrews is saying here is, \"Jesus \n                is God&#x92;s Son, and he has made purification for sins.\" \n                Most of the rest of the book of Hebrews is a further explanation \n                of this point and its theological and practical implications. \n                That is, the book of Hebrews is a homily with this point as its \n                topic. The writer will explain this point, flesh it out, explain \n                theological implications, and urge his readers to live their lives \n                in certain ways in response to it. This fact is important for \n                us in our understanding of the use of the OT in Hebrews for a \n                particular reason: it is a homily and NOT an apologetic. It is \n                readily noticed that the uses of the OT in Hebrews are not typically \n                introduced with a formula such as \"This was done to fulfill \n                the Scripture which said&#x85;\" I don&#x92;t think this is \n                a simple oversight on the part of the author; rather, I think \n                it fits quite logically with his purpose. Matthew appears to have \n                an apologetic purpose, and puts himself in a position of reasoning \n                <i>from</i> (OT) Scripture <i>to</i> the conclusion that Jesus \n                is God&#x92;s Messiah. He is offering proof from the Scriptures \n                that Jesus \"fulfills\" what the OT predicted about the \n                Messiah. By (important) contrast, fulfillment language is not \n                used in the book of Hebrews because \"fulfillment\" is \n                not what is being talked about. The writer of Hebrews is making \n                no claims about Jesus as fulfillment of OT Scripture. Rather, \n                he is <i>starting from</i> (rather than reasoning to) the notion \n                that Jesus is God&#x92;s Messiah. From there, he examines Scripture \n                which, as he sees it, makes important claims that can be applied \n                to God&#x92;s Messiah, and he then proceeds to expound upon the \n                implications of those claims. Indeed, it could almost be argued \n                that the most important verse for understanding the first seven \n                chapters of Hebrews is chapter 5, verse 12: \"For though by \n                this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone \n                to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God, \n                and you have come to need milk and not solid food.\" That \n                is, the writer is presenting an explanation of the elementary \n                points of Christian theology, and the implications of those points.</p>\n              <p>I believe that this tactic of the \n                author is by no means suspect, but is in fact quite logical. That \n                is why it is so important for us to realize what his goals are. \n                He is not using these passages to \"prove\" his theological \n                points, but rather to <i>explain</i> them, to make them more clear. \n                In short, he is adding theological depth without adding detailed \n                theological explanation. What I am referring to in the technique \n                of the writer of Hebrews is similar to what Richard Hays finds \n                in the writings of Paul. Hays points out that in Paul&#x92;s use \n                of the OT, \"In some cases the logic of the quotation depends \n                on a preexisting conceptual/theological structure, presupposed \n                both by Paul and by his intended readers but not explained in \n                the text\" (Hays, p. 87). Hays notes that these references \n                thus carry much more weight for Paul and his readers than they \n                might to a casual reader not familiar with OT literature and history: \n                \"Israel&#x92;s story, as told in Scripture, so comprehensively \n                constitutes the symbolic universe of Paul&#x92;s discourse that \n                he can recall the elements of that story for himself and his readers \n                with the sorts of subtle gestures that pass between members of \n                an interpretive family\" (Hays, p. 92). The writer of Hebrews \n                uses a similar technique, employing a neat shorthand way of explaining \n                the theological fullness of his claims by referring to OT passages \n                and applying their theological meaning to Christ. He does not \n                have to spend paragraphs and paragraphs stating \"Jesus is \n                like this and like this&#x85;\"; rather, in a few words he \n                is able to make statements which carry hundreds of years and hundreds \n                of pages worth of meaning. His readers can thus use what they \n                know of the Scriptures&#x97;and it seems that we can assume that \n                they know the Scriptures fairly well&#x97;as a means of coming \n                to an understanding of the theological nature of Christ.</p>\n              <p>The fact that the author of Hebrews \n                has \"started from\" rather than \"reasoned to\" \n                the notion of Jesus as Messiah is, I suppose, the main reason \n                that many commentators refer to this writer&#x92;s \"christocentric \n                hermeneutic.\" While I suppose that technically it could be \n                said, in light of my brief analysis, that such a label is correct, \n                I think that it is unfortunately misleading. Whether one means \n                it sympathetically (as I believe Longenecker does) or pejoratively \n                (as Hays seems to), I don&#x92;t think it does justice to what \n                the author is doing in Hebrews. For of course a strong implication \n                of such a term is to suggest that its practitioner is guilty of \n                allowing his presuppositions to have full sway over his hermeneutic \n                conclusions. But again, just as the writer is not performing an \n                exercise in apologetics in the book of Hebrews, I would also argue \n                that in chapters 1 and 2 he is not performing an exercise in hermeneutics. \n                (Let me note that I do think to a large degree what he is doing \n                in chapter 7 is precisely an exercise in hermeneutics: an exposition \n                of Psalm 110. But that does not mean he is doing the same thing \n                in chapters 1 and 2.) By way of clarification, let me say that \n                of course any time we work with texts, we are engaging in a hermeneutic \n                exercise. But I fear that when we refer to the writer&#x92;s \"christocentric \n                hermeneutic,\" it is easy to assume that the writer imposes \n                his christocentric presuppositions upon a text to <i>reason from</i> \n                that text that Jesus is Messiah. Of course as evangelical Christians, \n                we believe that we have a perspective on the OT that is able to \n                take in the \"big picture,\" in short, that Jesus Christ \n                provides the culmination of God&#x92;s redemptive plan for humanity. \n                And our understanding of OT texts is unavoidably&#x97;and rightly&#x97;colored \n                by that perspective. However, there is a danger in willy nilly \n                applying a \"christocentric hermeneutic\" to OT passages. \n                Besides the problem mentioned above of allowing our presuppositions \n                to determine our interpretation, more fundamentally we are susceptible \n                to not doing justice to the OT text. Just as good interpretation \n                of the NT seeks understanding of the original historical, cultural, \n                and literary context and meaning, good interpretation of the OT \n                must do the same. We very well may come to a christologic conclusion \n                about a passage, but that conclusion needs to be reached inductively \n                with each text, rather than imposed upon all texts. But too often \n                a \"christocentric hermeneutic\" means imposing a grid \n                on passages in the OT without first doing justice to their original \n                meaning. For example, while I believe I accept and agree with \n                his intent, I believe that Raymond Brown overstates his case when \n                he says that the writer of Hebrews maintains \"the profound \n                conviction that the Old Testament is a Christ-centred book\" \n                (p. 36). Thus he asserts, \"It is not that he superimposes \n                on the text a meaning it was not intended to convey; he brings \n                out a truth already there. He believes that Christ is everywhere \n                present in the Old Testament, though that might not necessarily \n                have been discerned by the original writers and readers\" \n                (p. 37). I think that Brown is simply painting with too wide of \n                a brush here. He is making claims that are beyond the scope of \n                the book of Hebrews, and particularly are not necessarily evident \n                in the first two chapters. I would suggest, again, that is not \n                what the writer of Hebrews is doing in chapters 1 and 2. Rather, \n                what he is doing is taking certain texts from the OT, interpreting \n                those, and then applying that meaning to Christ in order to make \n                a statement about his nature. The claims he makes about Jesus \n                in doing so then become the foundation for the points he makes \n                in chapters 3-7 (which in turn becomes the foundation for the \n                theological points in the chapters which follow).</p>\n              <p>Thus, I have to disagree with the \n                conclusion Longenecker draws regarding what the author of Hebrews \n                is doing in the first two chapters. He asserts that \"one \n                thing in the exegetical procedure seems certain: that from a christocentric \n                perspective, the author of Hebrews was asking concerning what \n                the Scriptures mean when they speak of God&#x92;s son (Ps 2:7; \n                2 Sam 7:14), of one whom all the angels of God are to worship \n                (Deut 32:43, LXX), and of one who is addressed as God by God, \n                yet distinguished from God (Pss 45:6-7; 102:25-27; 110:1)\" \n                (p. 161). I do not believe that the author of Hebrews is venturing \n                into such textual minutiae, and he is not claiming that what the \n                original texts \"mean\" is christocentric. As I believe \n                I can demonstrate, he rather interprets the OT passages in a very \n                straightforward way, and is in fact referring to them to make \n                a <i>claim</i> about the nature of Jesus.</p>\n              <p>As we look at the flow of thought \n                in Hebrews chapters 1 and 2, I think that the author is making \n                three points as explication of his initial statement that Jesus \n                is God&#x92;s Son, and he has made purification for sins: Jesus \n                is King, Jesus is God, Jesus is man. We see his first quotes from \n                the OT in verse 5: \"For to which of the angels did He ever \n                say, &#x91;YOU ARE MY SON, TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU&#x92;?\"</p>\n              <p>The first reference is to verse 7 \n                of Psalm 2. But we need to understand the whole of Psalm 2 to \n                understand how the writer of Hebrews is using this verse:</p>\n              <blockquote> \n                <p>1 Why are the nations in an uproar \n                  and the peoples devising a vain thing?</p>\n                <p>2 The kings of the earth take their \n                  stand and the rulers take counsel together against the LORD \n                  and against His Anointed, saying,</p>\n                <p>3 \"Let us tear their fetters \n                  apart and cast away their cords from us!\"</p>\n                <p>4 He who sits in the heavens laughs, \n                  the Lord scoffs at them.</p>\n                <p>5 Then He will speak to them in \n                  His anger and terrify them in His fury, saying,</p>\n                <p>6 \"But as for me, I have installed \n                  My King upon Zion, My holy mountain.\"</p>\n                <p>7 \"I will surely tell of the \n                  decree of the LORD: He said to me, <u>\"You are My Son, \n                  today I have begotten you.</u></p>\n                <p>8 \"Ask of me, and I will surely \n                  give the nations as your inheritance, and the {very} ends of \n                  the earth as your possession.</p>\n                <p>9 \"You shall break them with \n                  a rod of iron, you shall shatter them like earthenware.\"'</p>\n                <p>10 Now therefore, O kings, show \n                  discernment; take warning, O judges of the earth.</p>\n                <p>11 Worship the LORD with reverence \n                  and rejoice with trembling.</p>\n                <p>12 Do homage to the Son, that He \n                  not become angry, and you perish {in} the way, for His wrath \n                  may soon be kindled. How blessed are all who take refuge in \n                  Him!</p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>This is a royal psalm, a psalm about \n                God&#x92;s king. It can be argued that it is actually about the \n                king reigning in Israel at the time of its writing&#x85;and I \n                would suggest that this is exactly correct. There is no reason \n                to make a claim that Psalm 2 is a \"messianic psalm\",<sup><a name=\"Ref2\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/ntothebr.htm#Note2\">[2]</a></sup> \n                or to suggest that the psalmist actually saw himself writing about \n                the messiah. This is a psalm about God&#x92;s king, and that is \n                precisely why our author uses it here. For as a psalm about God&#x92;s \n                king, it is a psalm about the davidic king. In case his readers \n                don&#x92;t quite grasp that, the author in the second half of \n                verse 5 says: \"And again, &#x91;I WILL BE A FATHER TO HIM \n                AND HE SHALL BE A SON TO ME&#x92;?\" This of course is a reference \n                to the davidic covenant of 2 Samuel 7:</p>\n              <blockquote> \n                <p>8 \"Now therefore, thus you \n                  shall say to My servant David, \"Thus says the LORD of hosts, \n                  \"I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, \n                  to be ruler over My people Israel.</p>\n                <p>9 \"I have been with you wherever \n                  you have gone and have cut off all your enemies from before \n                  you; and I will make you a great name, like the names of the \n                  great men who are on the earth.</p>\n                <p>10 \"I will also appoint a \n                  place for My people Israel and will plant them, that they may \n                  live in their own place and not be disturbed again, nor will \n                  the wicked afflict them any more as formerly,</p>\n                <p>11 even from the day that I commanded \n                  judges to be over My people Israel; and I will give you rest \n                  from all your enemies. The LORD also declares to you that the \n                  LORD will make a house for you.</p>\n                <p>12 \"When your days are complete \n                  and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant \n                  after you, who will come forth from you, and I will establish \n                  his kingdom.</p>\n                <p>13 \"He shall build a house \n                  for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom \n                  forever.</p>\n                <p>14 \"<u>I will be a father \n                  to him and he will be a son to Me</u>; when he commits iniquity, \n                  I will correct him with the rod of men and the strokes of the \n                  sons of men,</p>\n                <p>15 but My lovingkindness shall \n                  not depart from him, as I took {it} away from Saul, whom I removed \n                  from before you.</p>\n                <p>16 \"Your house and your kingdom \n                  shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established \n                  forever.\"\"'</p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>Much can be said about this covenant \n                with David, but let&#x92;s understand the most important part \n                for our purposes: in verse 16, God tells David, \"Your house \n                and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall \n                be established forever.\" David of course immediately recognized \n                the import of the promises God was making to him: \"You have \n                spoken also of the house of Your servant concerning the distant \n                future\" (v. 19). Clearly these two passages together point \n                to the fact that there will be a davidic king ruling in the distant \n                future. And just as clearly, the writer of Hebrews is making the \n                claim that Jesus is the King. Or, to put it another way, the point \n                of the writer is not necessarily to say that \"the OT author \n                was referring to Christ\", but rather that \"Christ is \n                also a davidic king.\" He is making a retrojective (rather \n                than suggesting the existence of a projective) claim about the \n                nature of Jesus.<sup><a name=\"Ref3\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/ntothebr.htm#Note3\">[3]</a></sup></p>\n              <p>So, the author of Hebrews first makes \n                the claim about Jesus: He is king. Next, he claims that Jesus \n                is God. The next quote in Hebrews 1 reads as follows: \"And \n                when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says, \"AND \n                LET ALL THE ANGELS OF GOD WORSHIP HIM\" (v. 6). This passage \n                is a reference to the LXX version of Deuteronomy 32:43. About \n                this passage from Deuteronomy William Lane says: \"This well-known \n                passage was subsequently removed from its context in Deuteronomy \n                and adopted for liturgical use in the Temple, synagogue, and Church\" \n                (p. 28). But more importantly for our purposes, Lane also points \n                out that \"in its original context the summons has reference \n                to the worship or homage due to God\" (p. 28). Here is a good \n                example of how it is misleading to claim that the writer uses \n                a \"christocentric hermeneutic.\" The writer&#x92;s hermeneutic \n                is quite straightforward here: this is a statement about God. \n                The writer realizes it is about God. Furthermore, I would assert \n                that our author is by no means claiming that the original writer&#x97;inspired \n                by God&#x97;is writing about Jesus Christ&#x85;or about any other \n                messianic figure for that matter. No, he knows it is about God, \n                and that is as far as his hermeneutic goes. At that point, he \n                ceases interpreting and begins theologizing: he is making the \n                claim that Jesus Christ is God. He is not offering the text as \n                \"proof\" of this bold assertion; he is not reasoning \n                <i>from</i> the OT text to this conclusion. At this point he is \n                merely asserting it as a theological fact; if one begins with \n                the idea that Christ is God, then this passage applies to him.</p>\n              <p>The next passage of course quotes \n                Psalm 104 merely for the purpose of contrasting angels to God; \n                its immediate use is not at all confusing, but it is another good \n                example of the fact that the writer selects his passages primarily \n                for the purpose of asserting his theological point, rather than \n                as \"proof\" for his assertions. More interestingly, the \n                next passage, from Psalm 45, again combines the notion of being \n                king and being God: </p>\n              <blockquote> \n                <p>8 But of the Son {He says} \"YOUR \n                  THRONE, O GOD, IS FOREVER AND EVER, AND THE RIGHTEOUS SCEPTER \n                  IS THE SCEPTER OF HIS KINGDOM.</p>\n                <p>9 \"YOU HAVE LOVED RIGHTEOUSNESS \n                  AND HATED LAWLESSNESS; THEREFORE GOD, YOUR GOD, HAS ANOINTED \n                  YOU WITH THE OIL OF GLADNESS ABOVE YOUR COMPANIONS.\"</p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>These verses are pulled from Psalm \n                45, and here it is important for us to examine the entire psalm \n                as a whole:</p>\n              <blockquote> \n                <p>1 My heart overflows with a good \n                  theme; I address my verses to the King; My tongue is the pen \n                  of a ready writer.</p>\n                <p>2 You are fairer than the sons \n                  of men; Grace is poured upon your lips; therefore God has blessed \n                  you forever.</p>\n                <p>3 Gird your sword on {your} thigh, \n                  O Mighty One, {in} your splendor and your majesty!</p>\n                <p>4 And in your majesty ride on victoriously, \n                  for the cause of truth and meekness {and} righteousness; let \n                  your right hand teach you awesome things.</p>\n                <p>5 Your arrows are sharp; the peoples \n                  fall under you; {your arrows are} in the heart of the king's \n                  enemies.</p>\n                <p>6 Your throne, O God, is forever \n                  and ever; a scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom.</p>\n                <p>7 You have loved righteousness \n                  and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has anointed \n                  you with the oil of joy above your fellows.</p>\n                <p>8 All your garments are {fragrant \n                  with} myrrh and aloes {and} cassia; out of ivory palaces stringed \n                  instruments have made you glad.</p>\n                <p>9 Kings' daughters are among your \n                  noble ladies; at your right hand stands the queen in gold from \n                  Ophir.</p>\n                <p>10 Listen, O daughter, give attention \n                  and incline your ear: forget your people and your father's house;</p>\n                <p>11 Then the King will desire your \n                  beauty. Because He is your Lord, bow down to Him.</p>\n                <p>12 The daughter of Tyre {will come} \n                  with a gift; the rich among the people will seek your favor.</p>\n                <p>13 The king's daughter is all glorious \n                  within; her clothing is interwoven with gold.</p>\n                <p>14 She will be led to the King \n                  in embroidered work; the virgins, her companions who follow \n                  her, will be brought to you.</p>\n                <p>15 They will be led forth with \n                  gladness and rejoicing; they will enter into the king's palace.</p>\n                <p>16 In place of your fathers will \n                  be your sons; you shall make them princes in all the earth.</p>\n                <p>17 I will cause your name to be \n                  remembered in all generations; therefore the peoples will give \n                  you thanks forever and ever.</p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>The use of this passage is particularly \n                interesting in that portions of the beginning of the psalm clearly \n                are speaking of (and to) an historical, human king. Yet at a certain \n                point in the psalm&#x97;in fact, right here in verse 6, where \n                our author begins quoting&#x97;it clearly shifts to referring \n                to (and addressing) God. But then we realize that for much of \n                the psalm, God and the king are conflated; it is not clear when/if \n                the psalmist refers to a human king and when/if he refers to God. \n                As Bruce notes, \"to Hebrew poets and prophets a prince of \n                the house of David was the viceregent of Israel&#x92;s God; he \n                belonged to a dynasty to which God had made special promises bound \n                up with the accomplishment of His purpose in the world\" (p. \n                19-20). This poem has thus thrust the reader into the position \n                of conflating the role and rule of God with the role and rule \n                of the king. Thus, this is a brilliant choice on the part of our \n                author; it enables him to reassert both of the claims he has made \n                so far about Jesus: he is both king and God. As Lane says, \"The \n                writer&#x92;s primary interest in the quotation is not the predication \n                of deity but of the eternal nature of the dominion exercised by \n                the Son. The implication that the Son shares the quality of deity \n                only intensifies the reference to his eternal rule and sharpens \n                the contrast between the unchangeable Son and the mutable angels\" \n                (p. 29). Thus once again, we need not view the author as claiming \n                that Psalm 45 is \"messianic.\" In fact, he knows it is \n                about God, and quotes it in order to make a claim about Jesus. \n                </p>\n              <p>In case we have not gotten the point \n                that Jesus is in fact God, the author of Hebrews makes it crystal \n                clear:</p>\n              <blockquote> \n                <p>10 And, YOU, LORD, IN THE BEGINNING \n                  LAID THE FOUNDATION OF THE EARTH, AND THE HEAVENS ARE THE WORKS \n                  OF YOUR HANDS;</p>\n                <p>11 THEY WILL PERISH, BUT YOU REMAIN; \n                  AND THEY ALL WILL BECOME OLD LIKE A GARMENT,</p>\n                <p>12 AND LIKE A MANTLE YOU WILL ROLL \n                  THEM UP; LIKE A GARMENT THEY WILL ALSO BE CHANGED. BUT YOU ARE \n                  THE SAME, AND YOUR YEARS WILL NOT COME TO AN END.</p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>Jesus is not only \"a king,\" \n                or even a \"messianic king,\" as it might be possible \n                (though, I think, incorrect) to deduce from the passages already \n                quoted. In case we are inclined to assume that the he uses references \n                to God only to make a point about kingship, the author now quotes \n                from Psalm 102, which clearly refers to the all-powerful God:</p>\n              <blockquote> \n                <p>12 But you, O LORD, abide forever, \n                  and your name to all generations&#x85;.</p>\n                <p>18 This will be written for the \n                  generation to come, that a people yet to be created may praise \n                  the LORD.</p>\n                <p>19 For He looked down from His \n                  holy height; from heaven the LORD gazed upon the earth&#x85;</p>\n                <p>24 I say, \"O my God, do not \n                  take me away in the midst of my days, your years are throughout \n                  all generations.</p>\n                <p>25 \"Of old you founded the \n                  earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.</p>\n                <p>26 \"Even they will perish, \n                  but you endure; and all of them will wear out like a garment; \n                  like clothing you will change them and they will be changed.</p>\n                <p>27 \"But you are the same, \n                  and your years will not come to an end.</p>\n                <p>28 \"The children of your servants \n                  will continue, and their descendants will be established before \n                  you.\"</p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>Here, the claim is made not only \n                that Jesus in kingly, but that he is in fact one and the same \n                with the eternal creator God. It is he himself who \"of old&#x85;founded \n                the earth,\" and, as can be said only of God, forever he is \n                \"the same,\" and his years will not come to an end.\" \n                Jesus is God.</p>\n              <p>Chapter one then concludes with a \n                reference to Psalm 110: \"But to which of the angels has He \n                ever said, \"SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES \n                A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET\"? (v. 13). I do not wish to say \n                much about this passage other than to note that it at once looks \n                backwards, especially to verses 8 and 9 and Psalm 45, and more \n                generally to the entire chapter, in making the claim that Jesus \n                is king and God; and at the same time looks forward to the detailed \n                explanation of this Psalm in chapter 7.</p>\n              <p>So, up to this point the author has \n                made the claims that \"Jesus is King\" and \"Jesus \n                is God,\" and he has used OT passages as the means to make \n                the claim and also to add theological depth to his brief assertions. \n                At this point he continues making theological claims about Jesus, \n                but he shifts focus. His first quotation to reflect this new focus \n                comes in verses 6-8:</p>\n              <blockquote> \n                <p>6 But one has testified somewhere, \n                  saying, \"WHAT IS MAN, THAT YOU REMEMBER HIM? OR THE SON \n                  OF MAN, THAT YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HIM?</p>\n                <p>7 \"YOU HAVE MADE HIM FOR A \n                  LITTLE WHILE LOWER THAN THE ANGELS; YOU HAVE CROWNED HIM WITH \n                  GLORY AND HONOR, AND HAVE APPOINTED HIM OVER THE WORKS OF YOUR \n                  HANDS;</p>\n                <p>8 YOU HAVE PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION \n                  UNDER HIS FEET.\"</p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>This is of course a reference to \n                Psalm 8, a glorious picture of the dignity that God has assigned \n                to man:</p>\n              <blockquote> \n                <p>1 O LORD, our Lord, how majestic \n                  is your name in all the earth, who have displayed your splendor \n                  above the heavens!</p>\n                <p>2 From the mouth of infants and \n                  nursing babes you have established strength because of your \n                  adversaries, to make the enemy and the revengeful cease.</p>\n                <p>3 When I consider your heavens, \n                  the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you \n                  have ordained;</p>\n                <p>4 What is man that you take thought \n                  of him, and the son of man that you care for him?</p>\n                <p>5 Yet you have made him a little \n                  lower than God, and you crown him with glory and majesty!</p>\n                <p>6 You make him to rule over the \n                  works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet,</p>\n                <p>7 All sheep and oxen, and also \n                  the beasts of the field,</p>\n                <p>8 The birds of the heavens and \n                  the fish of the sea, whatever passes through the paths of the \n                  seas.</p>\n                <p>9 O LORD, our Lord, how majestic \n                  is your name in all the earth!</p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>Here again is a passage which shows \n                the importance of knowing what the author is attempting, rather \n                than merely assuming that he is performing a \"christocentric \n                interpretation\" of Psalm 8. I assert that he is by no means \n                claiming that Psalm 8 is or ever was a \"messianic psalm.\" \n                He is not claiming that what is being said could apply <i>only</i> \n                to Christ; the importance of this passage for his argument is \n                that this passage <i>does in fact refer to Christ</i>. This passage \n                in its original context clearly is talking about man; the author \n                of Hebrews does not wax christocentric in order to reinterpret \n                it. As Morris notes, \"The passage [from Psalms] is describing \n                the place of mankind in God&#x92;s order, and we do not come to \n                Christ&#x92;s place until v. 9\" (p. 24). The author in fact \n                uses the passage precisely because of its original (and current) \n                meaning: not only is Jesus king and God, but he was in fact also \n                human.</p>\n              <p>It is true that the phrase \"son \n                of man,\" though used exclusively about human man in Psalm \n                8, resonates with the messianic turn of phrase from the book of \n                Daniel and picked up by Christ&#x92;s own references to himself. \n                And I think there is good reason to think that the author slyly \n                chose this passage in order to take advantage of the ringing in \n                Jewish ears of the messianic implications of that term.<sup><a name=\"Ref4\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/ntothebr.htm#Note4\">[4]</a></sup> \n                But the rest of the chapter makes clear that the primary reason \n                for his use of this passage is to make the claim that Jesus in \n                fact became a man. This can be seen in the very next OT quotation: \n                \"I WILL PROCLAIM YOUR NAME TO MY BRETHREN, IN THE MIDST OF \n                THE CONGREGATION I WILL SING YOUR PRAISE\" (v. 12). The writer \n                tells us in verse 11 why he refers to this passage: \"He is \n                not ashamed to call them brethren.\" From a study of the gospels \n                we can infer that Jesus and the Christian community had already \n                applied Psalm 22, the source of this quotation, to Jesus the Messiah. \n                But, I would assert that that is not its primary reason for being \n                used here; the primary reason here is simply to use language which \n                allows him to assert the way in which Jesus interacts with humanity&#x97;he \n                has become to us as brothers, he has become like us. The author \n                does something similar in his quotation of Isaiah 8:18: he uses \n                the passage to bring in the language of human relationship. Thus, \n                we can conclude that the thrust of this chapter, and its use of \n                the OT, is to make the claim that Jesus is human. As the writer \n                himself says in verse 17: \"Therefore, He had to be made like \n                His brethren in all things, so that &#x85;\" The important \n                theological and devotional points that follow the \"so that\" \n                do not concern us at this point; suffice to say that this foundation \n                that has been laid in chapters 1 and 2&#x97;that Jesus is king, \n                God, and at the same time human&#x97;provides the theological \n                basis of all that follows in the book.</p>\n              <p>A full analysis of how this theological \n                foundation is used in the rest of the book of Hebrews&#x97;particularly \n                in chapters 3-7&#x97;is beyond the scope of the paper. But a brief \n                discussion will at least demonstrate that it is a reasonable claim. \n                Let me first of all assert that I absolutely am not suggesting \n                that the methods of using the OT in chapters 1 and 2&#x97;in short, \n                beginning with theological conclusions and using the OT to elucidate \n                the points&#x97;are used in the rest of the book. The OT is used \n                in several complex ways in the remaining portions of Hebrews, \n                and a discussion of those ways are well beyond the scope of this \n                paper. But the claims that the writer has made in these chapters&#x97;that \n                Jesus is king, is God, and is man&#x97;do provide a foundation \n                which the author builds upon in chapters 5 and 7. For in fact \n                this discussion of Melchizedek (which is, of course, essentially \n                an explanation of the hermeneutic of the author of Psalm 110) \n                rests on this three-fold nature of Jesus. For Melchizedek is a \n                king, which is highlighted by the repetition of the word in the \n                beginning of chapter 7:</p>\n              <blockquote> \n                <p>1 For this Melchizedek, <b>king</b> \n                  of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham as he \n                  was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,</p>\n                <p>2 to whom also Abraham apportioned \n                  a tenth part of all {the spoils} was first of all, by the translation \n                  {of his name} <b>king</b> of righteousness, and then also <b>king</b> \n                  of Salem, which is <b>king</b> of peace.</p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>Rather than analyzing by what means \n                the author presumes to stretch the meaning of words in order to \n                assert various types of kingship, I would assert that this repetition \n                rather is designed to emphasize the <i>fact</i> of his kingship. \n                Thus, based on the theological foundation established in chapter \n                1, we have a clear and immediate connection between him and Jesus; \n                Jesus is a presented as a king in chapters 1 and 2, which makes \n                him like Melchizedek the king. By association, then, Jesus is \n                also like Melchizedek in being a priest, as the author proceeds \n                to explain in chapter 7. This allows the author to make another \n                step: in order to be a true priest, Jesus had to be human. This \n                connection is made in verses 6-7:</p>\n              <blockquote> \n                <p>6 just as He says also in another \n                  {passage} \"YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER ACCORDING TO THE ORDER \n                  OF MELCHIZEDEK.\"</p>\n                <p>7 In the days of His flesh, He \n                  offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crying and \n                  tears to the One able to save Him from death, and He was heard \n                  because of His piety.</p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>This of course hearkens back to the \n                beautiful and well-known passage from chapter 4, which really \n                is the beginning of this current section, and which shows how \n                significant it is that Christ is a human high priest:</p>\n              <blockquote> \n                <p>14 Therefore, since we have a great \n                  high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son \n                  of God, let us hold fast our confession.</p>\n                <p>15 For we do not have a high priest \n                  who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been \n                  tempted in all things as {we are, yet} without sin.</p>\n                <p>16 Therefore let us draw near with \n                  confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy \n                  and find grace to help in time of need.</p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>But of course, his priestly actions \n                would not have placed him above the current system had he not \n                been in the nature of the eternal God and thus provided an eternal \n                sacrifice. And this point is indeed the ultimate point of this \n                section of the book, as is seen in this passage from 5:9-10:</p>\n              <blockquote> \n                <p>9 And having been made perfect, \n                  He became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation,</p>\n                <p>10 being designated by God as a \n                  high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.</p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>The conclusion that the writer of \n                Hebrews draws from this, and expands upon in chapter 8 and following, \n                is that \"so much the more also Jesus has become the guarantee \n                of a better covenant\" (v. 22). But the theological basis \n                for the claim is that which was established in chapters 1-2, that \n                Jesus is God and therefore eternal; as the author asserts in 7:23-25:</p>\n              <blockquote> \n                <p>23 The {former} priests, on the \n                  one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented \n                  by death from continuing,</p>\n                <p>24 but Jesus, on the other hand, \n                  because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently.</p>\n                <p>25 Therefore He is able also to \n                  save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He \n                  always lives to make intercession for them.</p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>Of course the next several chapters \n                of Hebrews contain the author&#x92;s argument that Jesus has superseded \n                the OT sacrificial system, that Jesus is the only sacrifice for \n                sin. The comparison with Melchizedek has enabled the author to \n                establish the nature of Christ's \"priesthood\" and the \n                nature of the covenant that he has now established with us; this \n                leads to a discussion of the \"new covenant\" from Jeremiah \n                and the implications for our current approach to God based upon \n                the blood of Jesus Christ alone. And of course from there the \n                author proceeds to encourage his readers to maintain their faith \n                and live their lives as they should. But the basis, the foundation, \n                for all of these points, must begin with the nature of Jesus Christ \n                himself. If Jesus is not the king, he is not like Melchizedek; \n                if he is not human, he cannot be a high priest for us; and if \n                he is not God, his sacrifice is no better than that of animals \n                and more importantly has no effect on our ultimate relationship \n                with God. Therefore the author begins this book by asserting and \n                explaining the nature of Jesus Christ, the basis for all of the \n                theological and practical implications which follow. </p>\n              <p><a name=\"BIBLIOGRAPHY\"><strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong></a></p>\n              <p>Brown, Raymond. <i>The Message of \n                Hebrews: Christ Above All</i>.

But I do believe that that this is the general \n                hermeneutical context for the use of the OT in the NT.<i> Return \n                to <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/ntothebr.htm#Ref1\">Text</a></i></p>\n              <p><sup><a name=\"Note2\">[2]</a></sup> \n                Or to imply it by capitalizing the first letter of \"son,\" \n                \"king,\" \"anointed,\" etc., as many modern versions \n                do.<i> Return to <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/ntothebr.htm#Ref2\">Text</a></i></p>\n              <p><sup><a name=\"Note3\">[3]</a></sup> \n                Thus I have to disagree slightly with Newell, who sees in verse \n                5 an emphasis on the humanity of Jesus. While that might be implied, \n                I believe that the notion of kingship is more important, for it \n                provides a foundation for later points in the book.<i> Return \n                to <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/ntothebr.htm#Ref3\">Text</a></i></p>\n              <p><sup><a name=\"Note4\">[4]</a></sup> \n                I am thinking here of what Hays refers to as \"resonant significations\" \n                (p. 90) that are contained in the text being quoted. That is, \n                there are theological meanings resounding in the original text \n                which, though they are not expounded on in the NT quotation, nonetheless \n                reverberate for the knowledgeable reader of the text.<i> Return \n                to <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/ntothebr.htm#Ref4\">Text</a></i></p>\n              <p>Copyright &#xA9; 2000 \n                Tim Clark\n            </p></td>\n          </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"New Testament Use of the Old Testament: A Case Study from Hebrews 1-2","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/ntothebr.htm"}

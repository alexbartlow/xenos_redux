Many modern scholars would \n                argue that Matthew also interprets the Old Testament using <i>pesher \n                </i>when, for example, he applies Hosea 11:1 to Christ's sojourn \n                in Egypt. If it is true that New Testament authors interpreted \n                the Old Testament this way, then it is a little unsettling. The \n                most pressing concern is that <i>pesher</i>, <i>peshat </i>and \n                many later <i>misrash</i> techniques are fundamentally eisegetical. \n                That is, these hermeneutical approaches are hostile to the notion \n                of objective interpretation. If this is the case, then it brings \n                into question the legitimacy of many critical NT uses of the OT. \n                Ultimately, if NT authors did use rabbinical hermeneutics, then \n                one must question the very authority of the New Testament in critical \n                matters of faith. </p>\n               \n              <p>A second, if lesser, concern is the contribution New Testament \n                authors make to the study of scripture interpretation. Even if \n                Matthew was not using <i>pesher</i> techniques, what interpretive \n                approach was he taking? Can modern scholarship use his methods \n                or was he exercising the insights of a prophet when he interpreted \n                the Old Testament? If so, then contemporary interpreters can gain \n                little assistance in their own hermeneutical tasks from Matthew. \n                The purposes of this paper are twofold: to investigate whether \n                Matthew was using <i>pesher</i> techniques in his use of Old Testament \n                and, if not, to identify what interpretive approach to the Old \n                Testament he was taking in his gospel.</p>\n              <p><strong><a name=\"WHAT\">WHAT IS PESHER?</a></strong></p>\n              <p>Several approaches to scripture analysis may be discovered in \n                first century Hebrew documents including literalistic, allegorical, \n                <i>midras</i> and <i>pesher</i>. Longman doubts that these methods \n                were distinguished from one another in the first century. Of these \n                methods, <i>pesher</i> is of the greatest interest to this study, \n                principally because Matthew does not lie under the accusation \n                that he interprets the OT literalistically or allegorically but \n                rather through <i>pesher</i>. Perhaps Matthew uses <i>midrashic</i> \n                techniques, as many contend, but it can be argued that first century \n                <i>midrash</i> could be very much akin to the manner in which \n                Psalmists interpreted the Pentateuch. Early <i>midrash</i>, as \n                defined by Hillel, is a fairly objective hermeneutical approach.<sup><a name=\"Ref2\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtmain.htm#Note2\">[2]</a></sup> \n                It is the claim that Matthew is using <i>pesher</i> contemporization \n                of the OT, particularly in &#x91;fulfillment&#x92; citations, \n                that provides the most serious challenge to those holding to verbal, \n                plenary inspiration. </p>\n               \n              <p>The term <i>pesher</i> \n                means, \"to explain.\" In fact, however, <i>pesher</i> \n                is an application of OT scripture with little to no concern for \n                the context of the passage applied. <i>Pesher</i> may refer either \n                to commentaries on the OT found amongst the Dead Sea scrolls<sup><a name=\"Ref3\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtmain.htm#Note3\">[3]</a></sup> \n                or to the interpretive technique typical of these commentaries.<sup><a name=\"Ref4\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtmain.htm#Note4\">[4]</a></sup> \n                <i>Pesher </i>interpreters assume that OT authors were speaking \n                to the contemporary audience. This form of interpretation is tied \n                to a word, text or OT allusion, which is then related to a present \n                person, place or thing. The interpretations are generally aloof \n                from the source context and appear to lack any coherent methodology. \n                According to Lundberg, \"This kind of commentary (<i>pesher</i>) \n                is not an attempt to explain what the Bible meant when it was \n                originally written, but rather what it means in the day and age \n                of the commentator, particularly for his own community.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref5\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtmain.htm#Note5\">[5]</a></sup></p>\n              <p>For instance, in \n                the <i>pesher</i> Habakkuk the writers simply take Habakkuk&#x92;s \n                references to the Chaledeans and apply them to the Romans without \n                any effort to justify the application. The context of Habakkuk \n                seems to hold little interest for such interpreters. In the same \n                commentary all the destructive activities described by Habakkuk \n                are attributed to the &#x91;wicked priest&#x92; while all the \n                good things are attributed to the &#x91;righteous teacher&#x92; \n                &#x96; the antagonist and protagonist typical of Qumran <i>pesher</i> \n                writing. Again, the interpreter shows little inclination to justify \n                the wholesale substitution of the authorial intent for that of \n                his community.</p>\n              <p><strong><a name=\"WAS\">WAS MATTHEW \n                USING PESHER?</a></strong></p>\n              <p>Clearly, Matthew \n                is not a <i>pesher</i> commentary. Such texts are line-by-line \n                analyses of an OT text and Matthew&#x92;s gospel does not conform \n                to this format. Rather, Matthew applies OT citations to his narrative \n                of the life of Christ. </p>\n              <p>While Matthew cannot \n                be construed as a <i>pesher </i>commentary, it could still be \n                true that Matthew is using the <i>pesher</i> devise of OT contemporization. \n                Matthew&#x92;s use of Hosea 11:1 seems so disinterested in its \n                plain meaning that a cursory comparison of Hosea 11:1 with Matthew \n                2:15 certainly leaves the impression he is using this approach.<sup><a name=\"Ref6\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtmain.htm#Note6\">[6]</a></sup> \n                However, there are several reasons to doubt that Matthew is using \n                <i>pesher</i> techniques:</p>\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  <p>While both Matthew \n                    and <i>pesher </i>commentaries use citations from a variety \n                    of sources, it appears that many of Matthew&#x92;s translations \n                    are his own and Matthew&#x92;s citations do not show interpretive \n                    or selection bias typical of <i>pesher</i>.<sup><a name=\"Ref7\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtmain.htm#Note7\">[7]</a></sup></p>\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  <p>The formal features \n                    of OT quotes in Matthew do not correspond to any such features \n                    in Qumran text.<sup><a name=\"Ref8\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtmain.htm#Note8\">[8]</a></sup></p>\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  <p>Qumran applications \n                    were treated as identical to interpretations without regard \n                    to historic context - few such tendencies are found in NT \n                    use of the OT.<sup><a name=\"Ref9\" id=\"Ref9\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtmain.htm#Note8\">[9]</a></sup></p>\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  <p>Matthew did not \n                    use many OT passages that conform to a fulfillment motif which \n                    is unexpected if he was simply grabbing proof-texts from the \n                    OT.<sup><a name=\"Ref10\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtmain.htm#Note10\">[10]</a></sup></p>\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  <p>Many fulfillment \n                    passages used by Matthew do not conform to known messianic \n                    prophecy material advanced in Jewish circles.

At other times the OT is used by way of application. \n                For example, Christ is recorded as using the OT for training when \n                he frames OT narratives into question and answer sessions (e.g. \n                15:4; 19:4-7, 18-19). In other ways Christ draws particular applications \n                out of OT narratives (e.g. Mat.12:3-8, citing Isa.21:6; Lev.24:5,9; \n                Nu.28:9 to condemn Sabbath legalism). In these cases, however, \n                Christ is generally using the OT the way OT authors used antecedent \n                text. The psalmists often cited Pentateuchal narratives in order \n                to draw out salient spiritual principles or theology.<sup><a name=\"Ref14\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtmain.htm#Note14\">[14]</a></sup> \n                Even in those cases where Christ's application of the OT differs \n                from the approach of OT authors, his use still is not at all like \n                the approach seen in first century <i>midrash</i> because unlike \n                much rabbinical <i>midrash</i>, Jesus works within the context \n                of the citations he uses. When Jesus applies the OT differently \n                from the psalmist application hermeneutic, he is speaking prophetically \n                (e.g. \"You've heard it said, but I say&#x85;\"). In these \n                ways he adds to earlier revelation, not in a way that disregards \n                but rather extends the earlier revelation. This too is an interpretive \n                role played by OT prophets in their use of antecedent and new \n                revelation.<sup><a name=\"Ref15\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtmain.htm#Note15\">[15]</a></sup> \n                In these uses of the Old Testament Christ, or Matthew as his biographer, \n                are not guilty of interpreting the scripture in ways alien to \n                how Old Testament authors interpreted the Old Testament.<sup><a name=\"Ref16\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtmain.htm#Note16\">[16]</a></sup></p>\n              <p>Many of Matthew's \n                citations are apologetic in nature, that is, Matthew cites the \n                OT to show how Christ fulfilled OT scripture.

This not only appears unlikely but unsafe for the \n                veracity of much of Matthew's gospel, to say nothing of the rest \n                of the New Testament. Other scholars recognize the problem but \n                suggest that careful analysis of the relevant OT citations would \n                vindicate Matthew's interpretation.<sup><a name=\"Ref18\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtmain.htm#Note18\">[18]</a></sup> \n                Some suggest that God's intent when he inspired the OT author \n                was much more profound than the OT author himself realized.<sup><a name=\"Ref19\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtmain.htm#Note19\">[19]</a></sup> \n                Still others say that Matthew was simply noting historically analogous \n                situations for his audience with the suggestion that Christ completed \n                the earlier motifs.<sup><a name=\"Ref20\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtmain.htm#Note20\">[20]</a></sup> \n                Each of these attempted solutions to the problem of OT usage in \n                NT fulfillment passages have provided some important insights \n                into NT use of the OT but each also serves to raise critical questions \n                about the appropriate use of the Old Testament. A few points must \n                be considered before the question of Matthew's OT use can be fully \n                addressed.</p>\n              <p>First, as many scholars \n                have noted, Matthew's terminology pertaining to fulfillment is \n                much richer than such words suggest to most readers. Matthew indicates \n                15 times that Christ fulfilled an OT scripture.<sup><a name=\"Ref21\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtmain.htm#Note21\">[21]</a></sup> \n                The term <i>pleroo</i> and related terms have wider semantic range \n                than simple predictive realization. These words can communicate \n                the idea of &#x91;completing&#x92;, &#x91;establishing&#x92; or \n                &#x91;filling up&#x92; as well as prediction-outcome. For Matthew \n                to suggest that some aspect of the life of Christ fulfills some \n                antecedent scripture could mean that an OT passage made a prediction \n                and Christ expressed that precise prediction. But, fulfillment \n                can also mean that Christ \"filled to overflowing\" or \n                \"completed\" the antecedent scripture. This second sense \n                is the way a reader can comprehend Christ's claim that he fulfilled \n                the Law &amp; Prophets in Matthew 5:17. Fulfillment quotations \n                are infused with the concept of God's redemptive purpose in human \n                history and so Matthew quotes texts that directly predict but \n                also passages that have thematic significance that exceeds the \n                OT author immediate meaning. This is different than <i>sensus \n                plenior</i> because the NT author is not uncovering meaning hidden \n                to the OT author. Instead, he is using the OT passage as an example \n                of a broad theme of which the OT author was aware.<sup><a name=\"Ref22\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtmain.htm#Note22\">[22]</a></sup> \n                Thus, some concerns over Matthew's use of the OT may be tempered \n                by a better sense of what Matthew intended when he said Christ \n                fulfilled a scripture. </p>\n              <p>Second, C. H. Dodd \n                has shown that the NT use of the OT is not haphazard proof-texting \n                but the use of a few text plots in the OT. For instance Isaiah \n                53 is cited 34 times in the NT.<sup><a name=\"Ref23\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtmain.htm#Note23\">[23]</a></sup> \n                For the early church, it is likely that a limited citation served \n                as a pointer to an entire theme of which the audience was well \n                apprised:</p>\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  <p>Apocalyptic-Eschatological \n                    Scriptures (e.g. Joel 2, 3; Zech.9-14; Dan.7; Mal.3:1-6; Dan.12</p>\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  <p>Scriptures about \n                    the new Israel (Hosea; Isa.6:1-9:7; 11:1-10; 28:16; 40:1-11; \n                    Jer.31:10-34; Isa.29:9-14; Jer.7:1-15; Hab.1,2)</p>\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  <p>Servant of the \n                    Lord scriptures (Isa.42:1-44:5; 49:1-13; 50:4-1; 52:13-53:12; \n                    61; Ps.69; 22; 31; 38; 88; 34; 118; 41; 42-43; 80; Isa.58; \n                    6-10)</p>\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  <p>Unclassified \n                    scriptures ( Ps.8; 110; 2; Gen.12:3; 22:18; Deut.18:15,19; \n                    Ps.132; 16; 2Sam.7:13,14; Isa.55:3; Am.9:11,12; Ex.1-4; 24; \n                    34; Nu.23; 24; 2Ki.1; Ps.78; Dan.2; Isa.13; 34; 35; Micah \n                    4; 5; 7; Zech.1-6; the rest of Micah beyond 3:6)</p>\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n              <p>Given this, it is \n                possible to look, not merely to a limited citation used by Matthew, \n                but to the whole theme of which Matthew's citation is simply a \n                pointer.</p>\n              <p><strong><a name=\"CASE\">CASE \n                STUDY: MATTHEW 2:15</a> </strong></p>\n              <p>In this citation, \n                Matthew takes the MT approach of literally translating \"son\" \n                rather than the LXX \"His children.\" It is possible that \n                Matthew may have intended to allude to the entire section through \n                the use of a single citation (c.f. Hosea 11:1-11). It is difficult \n                to concede that Matthew is using midrashic interpretive approaches \n                for the reasons articulated above. On the other hand, efforts \n                to find ways to argue that Matthew's use is appropriate analysis \n                of a prediction are also hard to concede. </p>\n              <p>Howard sees Matthew&#x92;s \n                use of Hosea as retrospective analogical correspondence rather \n                than an effort on God&#x92;s part to embed a projective type or \n                prophecy about Christ in Hosea&#x92;s words. That is, Matthew \n                noted that Jesus was like Israel in that he also went to Egypt \n                but that, unlike Israel, he was the son obedient to the covenant. \n                When Israel left Egypt they dropped the ball. Whereas, when Christ \n                left Egypt he was the son, in whom God was very pleased. In this \n                way, Christ fulfilled (i.e. competed) all that God intended for \n                Israel.</p>\n              <p>An alternative view \n                is that the Exodus event was a prototype that was subsequently \n                echoed when it was recalled for the purpose of instruction<sup><a name=\"Ref24\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtmain.htm#Note24\">[24]</a></sup> \n                and that was repeated in the coming of Joshua to Palestine &amp; \n                Judah from the Babylonian exile. </p>\n              <p>The approach taken \n                to the interpretation of this passage will include the following \n                stages: 1. Analysis of the context of Matthew's citation of Hosea; \n                2. Analysis of the context of Hosea 11:1; 3. Assessment of the \n                retrospective and projective function of Hosea's citation and \n                4. Assessment of Matthew's use of Hosea as an example of fulfillment.</p>\n              <p>Analysis of the context \n                of Matthew 2:13-15</p>\n              <p>The narrative passages \n                before and after Matthew 2:13-15 appear to be arguments from the \n                Torah that Jesus was the messiah and the fulfillment of the Abrahamic \n                and Davidic covenants.<sup><a name=\"Ref25\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtmain.htm#Note25\">[25]</a></sup> \n                The genealogy of chapter 1:1-17 is framed at the beginning and \n                end with the claim that Jesus was the messiah. Chapter 1:18-25 \n                is a reference to a passage that culminates in the promise of \n                a God/king who would rule from the throne of David (Isa.7:14-9:7). \n                Chapter 2:1-12 contain a reference to a messianic scripture that \n                contains allusions to both the Davidic and Abrahamic covenants. \n                After 2:13-15 Matthew cites Jeremiah 31:15 which is a clear reference \n                to the mourning associated with the Babylonian captivity but is \n                at the beginning of a long prediction of the restoration of Israel \n                leading to a new covenant that will result in the laws of God \n                being internalized by his people (c.f Isaiah 31:31-34). It is \n                difficult to make definitive statements about Matthew 2:19-23 \n                but many scholars believe it refers to prophecies concerning the \n                'branch' found in Isaiah 4:2, Zechariah 3:8,9 &amp; 6:12. Finally, \n                Matthew's citation of Isaiah 40:3 appears to be a pointer to a \n                lengthy passage concerned with God's redemption of Israel through \n                Cyrus and through the Servant of YHWH (Isa.42:1-7).</p>\n              <p>The context of Matthew \n                2:13-15 is the correlation of Jesus with significant OT scriptures \n                that address God's redemptive activity toward Israel and toward \n                Gentiles - scriptures that identify Jesus as messiah and the fulfillment \n                of the covenants of Abraham and David. It would be expected, therefore, \n                that Matthew's citation of Hosea 11:1 would also anticipate his \n                role as redeemer or sovereign.</p>\n              <p>Analysis of the context \n                of Hosea 11:1</p>\n              <p>Hosea is citing the \n                exodus in Hosea 11:1. This event was a critical one in the OT \n                because it demonstrated God's remembrance and redemption of Israel. \n                The expression \"out of Egypt\" appears several times \n                in Hosea (e.g. 11:1; 12:9, 13; 13:4). Hosea 11:1 is in the context \n                of God's love for Israel. Hosea 12:9 speaks of God's discipline. \n                Chapter 12:13 talks of how God used a prophet to redeem an ungrateful \n                people. Hosea 13:4 uses the exodus to promise God will assert \n                his sovereign rights over Israel once again. These passages and \n                the core narrative of Hosea's redemption of Gomer make it clear \n                that Hosea 11:1 is intensely focused on God's once and future \n                redemption of Israel (c.f. Hosea 2:14 - 3:4). </p>\n              <p>Assessment of the \n                retrospective and projective function of Hosea 11:1</p>\n              <p>The exodus account \n                is a deferred hope in critical respects. Israel could have been \n                a nation of priests (e.g. Exodus 19:4-6) but it chose not to satisfy \n                the terms of the covenant. In this sense the exodus was incomplete. \n                Hosea addresses the exodus to remind Israel of God's love, power \n                and sovereignty and to anchor his promise for future redemption \n                both from Assyria and ultimately from their own rebelliousness.</p>\n              <p>When Matthew cites \n                Hosea 11:1 he is citing the entire redemptive context, not only \n                of Hosea but of the rest of the Old Testament. Citation of Hosea \n                11:1 reminds Israel of their double redemption from Egypt &amp; \n                Assyria/Babylon but also anticipates their final redemption from \n                themselves. </p>\n              <p>Assessment of Matthew \n                2:15's use of Hosea 11:1 as fulfillment</p>\n              <p>When Hosea records, \n                <i>Out of Egypt I have called my son</i>, he is tapping into an \n                exodus motif that was expressed in the original event; reiterated \n                and extended to \"the king\" of Israel by Balaam (Nu.24:8); \n                reiterated when Joshua entered Palestine; reiterated when the \n                principle of redemption was applied repeatedly in OT didactic \n                material; that would be reiterated later when Israel was restored \n                after her impending discipline (Hos 6:1-3; 8:1-10:5) and again \n                when God would permanently redeem his people. Matthew was simply \n                noting something implicit in Hosea, namely, Christ was the ultimate \n                fulfillment of God's promised redemption of Israel (Hos.11:1-14:5). \n                Hosea certainly understood that his recollection of the Exodus \n                was anchored in God's past redemptive history as well as his future \n                promise of final redemption. And, this is exactly what Matthew \n                did by pointing to its manifestation in Christ. Christ returned \n                to Israel from Egypt, as an obedient son and also as God coming \n                again to dwell in the tents of Shem. The resonance with the exodus \n                motif is so remarkable that Matthew could say Christ 'filled up \n                to overflowing' the entire theme. If we were contemporaries of \n                Matthew we too could have anticipated a final redemption of Israel \n                and rejoiced when we saw its penultimate fulfillment in the first \n                advent of Christ and hoped in its ultimate fulfillment in his \n                second advent.</p>\n              <p>Interestingly, Christ&#x92;s \n                <i>exodus</i> not only recapitulated the return of Israel to the \n                land but also the advent of God dwelling with his people. For \n                Christ's return to Israel was also the return of God dwelling \n                in the tents of Shem. In these ways Christ <i>filled to overflowing</i> \n                the exodus. And, in this sense, Hosea&#x92;s recall of the exodus \n                has a projective role because it is connected both to the past \n                Exodus event and to God&#x92;s redemptive commitment to Israel \n                yet unrealized. When Matthew considers the words of Hosea he is \n                not merely saying, \"Gee, isn&#x92;t this interesting how \n                both Israel &amp; Christ returned to the land from Egypt.\" \n                What he is communicating must not merely be analogical correspondence. \n                Isn&#x92;t Matthew also saying, \"What Hosea hoped for, the \n                redemption of Israel from sin, was fully realized in Christ?\"</p>\n              <p><a name=\"CONCLUSION\"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></a></p>\n              <p>What is clear from \n                this preliminary study is that Matthew was not using <i>pesher</i>-like \n                eisegetical techniques, when he used the Old Testament in his \n                gospel. He apparently often used his own translations of Greek, \n                Hebrew and Aramaic sources rather than isolating extant translations \n                that fit an interpretive agenda. Significantly, his putative interpretations \n                are not self-serving but correspond to interpretations found in \n                Septuigental, Masoretic, Syrian and rabbinical materials from \n                the same era. Similarly, his applications of the Old Testament \n                to New Testament events do not have the tortured appearance of \n                those found in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Even in some of the more \n                challenging &#x91;fulfillment&#x92; materials Matthew&#x92;s use \n                of the Old Testament does not correspond with <i>pesher</i> techniques \n                used by the Qumran community.</p>\n              <p>What Matthew's fulfillment \n                citations often appear to do is often show points of resonance \n                with well developed redemptive themes in the OT of which Christ \n                is the consummation. If this is true, Matthew may show us how \n                to interpret the OT by indicating that earlier scriptures have \n                both projective and retrojective functions as they reiterate the \n                theology of an earlier motif or prototype and yet anticipate complete \n                realization in some future act of God. </p>\n              <p>Without prophetic \n                authority we may have to hold conclusions drawn from such techniques \n                more tentatively than Matthew does. Nonetheless, the use of interpretive \n                methods consonant with those found in scripture substantially \n                strengthens the confidence of modern interpreters who are committed \n                to the kind of careful exegesis that honors the intent of the \n                ultimate author. </p>\n              <p><strong><a name=\"NOTES\">NOTES</a></strong></p>\n              <p><sup><a name=\"Note1\">[1]</a></sup> \n                These techniques included: <i>peshat</i> (i.e. literalistic), \n                <i>midrash</i> (i.e. there is quite a bit of variance within this \n                tradition), <i>pesher</i> (i.e. complete contemporization of OT), \n                apocalyptic (i.e. contemporization of some OT passages) &amp; \n                allegorical. Longman suggests that individual interpreters may \n                have used all four methods and may not have distinguished them \n                as distinct approaches. See Appendix E for methods of predictive \n                prophecy interpretation. <i>Return to <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtmain.htm#Ref1\">Text</a></i></p>\n              <p><sup><a name=\"Note2\">[2]</a></sup> \n                This is not to say that <i>midrashic </i>approaches to interpretation \n                were typically objective. Most rabbinical <i>midrash</i> used \n                the OT as a springboard without concern for the context of the \n                material cited. <i>Midrash</i> refers to a Hebrew method of citing, \n                interpreting and then amplifying an OT passage. The term <i>midrash</i> \n                also refers to the oral and then, later, the written collections \n                of <i>midrash </i>expositions and applications. <i>Haggadah midrash</i> \n                refers to the ethical and expository interpretation of non-legal \n                materials from the Hebrew Bible. <i>Halakah midrash</i> applied \n                the general principles of OT laws to specific situations. This \n                was an application of the Torah in a kind of 'case law' format. \n                Various <i>midrash </i>methods are claimed to find their origin \n                in Hillel, Rabbi Ishmael and Rabbi Eliezer ben Jose ha-Galili. \n                Hillel&#x92;s 7 methods include: </p>\n              <blockquote> \n                <p><i>a. a fortiori</i> \n                  arguments from OT texts (i.e. called <i>qual yahomer</i>).</p>\n                <p>b. When the same word is found \n                  in a proximate text then the principles of one are transferable \n                  to the other (i.e. called <i>gezerah shawah</i>)</p>\n                <p>c. When the same phrase is found \n                  in different texts, the principles of one context are transferable \n                  to the others (i.e. called <i>binyan ab mikathub &#x91;ehad</i>).</p>\n                <p>d. Meaning is established by its \n                  context.</p>\n                <p>e. Difficult passages are interpreted \n                  by comparison with clear passages containing similar principles \n                  (i.e. called <i>kayoze bo bemaqom &#x91;aher</i>, lit. as is \n                  found in another place).</p>\n                <p>f. A particular rule may be extended \n                  to a general principle and a general principle may justify a \n                  particular rule (i.e. called <i>kelal upherat</i>, the general \n                  and the particular).</p>\n                <p>g. A principle is developed by \n                  synthesis of related texts (i.e. called <i>binyan ab mishene \n                  kethubim</i>). Chain quotations are thought to be a form of \n                  this <i>midrashic</i> device.</p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>The later methodologies \n                of Rabbi Ishmael &amp; Rabbi Eliezer opened the door for more \n                eisegetical approaches to scripture.<i> Return to <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtmain.htm#Ref2\">Text</a></i></p>\n              <p><sup><a name=\"Note3\">[3]</a></sup> \n                Pesher Habakkuk &amp; Pesher Hosea are examples of these commentaries. \n                See appendix C for a sample of <i>pesher </i>Habakkuk.<i> Return \n                to <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue3/mtmain.htm#Ref3\">Text</a></i></p>\n              <p><sup><a name=\"Note4\">[4]</a></sup> \n                According to Krister Stendahl (1954) <i>The School of St. Matthew \n                and Its Use of the Old Testament, </i>p.14; See also Longenecker \n                pp.144-145 and Tracy L.

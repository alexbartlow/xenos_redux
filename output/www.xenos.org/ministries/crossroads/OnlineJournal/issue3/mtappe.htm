As much \n                      as possible, passages are taken to have a straightforward \n                      meaning that can be determined through an understanding \n                      of vocabulary and syntax.

Usually, however, \n                      identification and interpretation of such devises is authorized \n                      by the text itself. The historic context of various texts \n                      is thought to be critically important for the interpretation \n                      process. This method is concerned with interpretation in \n                      context. It recognizes that biblical revelation is progressive \n                      and so interpretation of earlier material cannot be derived \n                      from our understanding of God&#x92;s activities obtained \n                      from later material. This method assumes that scripture \n                      is not contradictory and so opposing alternative interpretations \n                      are rejected.

This approach is defined in various ways \n                      by modern thinkers. Part of this is due to the many approaches \n                      found in rabbinical materials.

This deeper meaning explains earlier expressions \n                      of the motif and also anticipates subsequent reiterations \n                      of the same motif. </p>\n                    <p><b>When Hosea \n                      records, <i>Out of Egypt I have called my son</i>, he is \n                      tapping into an exodus motif that was expressed in the original \n                      event; reiterated and extended to \"the king\" of \n                      Israel by Balaam (Nu.24:8); reiterated when Joshua entered \n                      Palestine; reiterated when the principle of redemption was \n                      applied repeatedly in OT didactic material; that would be \n                      reiterated later when Israel was restored after her impending \n                      discipline (Hos 6:1-3; 8:1-10:5) and again when God would \n                      permanently redeem his people. Matthew was simply noting \n                      something implicit in Hosea, namely, Christ was the ultimate \n                      fulfillment of God's promised redemption of Israel (Hos.11:1-14:5). \n                      Hosea certainly understood that his recollection of the \n                      Exodus was anchored in God's past redemptive history as \n                      well as his future promise of final redemption. And, this \n                      is exactly what Matthew did by simply pointing out its manifestation \n                      in Christ. Christ returned to Israel from Egypt, as an obedient \n                      son and also as God coming again to dwell in the tents of \n                      Shem. The resonance with the exodus motif is so remarkable \n                      that Matthew could say Christ 'filled up to overflowing' \n                      the entire theme. If we were contemporaries of Matthew we \n                      too could have anticipated a final redemption of Israel \n                      and rejoiced when we saw its penultimate fulfillment in \n                      the first advent of Christ and hoped in its ultimate fulfillment \n                      in his second advent.</b>\n                  </p></td>\n                  <td width=\"15%\" valign=\"TOP\">Projective \n                    &amp; retrospective; objective.</td>\n                </tr>\n              </table>\n              <p><b>NOTES</b></p>\n              \n              <p><sup><a name=\"Note1\">[1]</a></sup>This list is \n                not exhaustive.

In the Old Testament \n              God has words of strong rebuke and warning for bad shepherds, and \n              prophecies of a good shepherd that is to come. In the New Testament, \n              Jesus identifies himself as the Good Shepherd and we find in the \n              epistles the notion of good shepherding extended to those who would \n              lead in the church.\n              <p>This paper will attempt to explore \n                the shepherding motif in some detail. In specific it will answer \n                the following three questions: Why might have God chosen to use \n                this particular image? What are the characteristics of a good \n                shepherd? Who is the Shepherd that is to come referred to in the \n              Old Testament?</p>\n              <p><a name=\"Whytheimageoftheshepherd?\"><b>Why \n              the image of the shepherd?</b></a></p>\n              <p>The idea of shepherding, and in specific \n                the idea of God acting as the Shepherd of His people, is a motif \n                found throughout the Bible, from beginning to end. In Gen. 48:24, \n                as Jacob, on his deathbed summarized his life, he declared that \n                God had been his &#x93;<i>shepherd all of his life to this day</i>.&#x94; \n                In Rev. 7:17, when the saints who come out of the tribulation are \n                brought before God, John brings together two of the most striking \n                images of the scripture by stating, \"<i>for the Lamb in the \n                center of the throne shall be their shepherd and shall guide them \n                to springs of the water of life; and God shall wipe every tear \n              from their</i> <i>eye.&#x94; </i></p>\n              <p>While perhaps not found with as much \n                frequency as other motifs in the Bible, the theme of the shepherd \n                is very significant. It appears at critical times in the narrative \n                of the history of God&#x92;s people, and hardly another motif \n              is as rich in content.</p>\n              <p>Why did God choose to include this \n                motif as part of His revelation to man? Scripture itself does \n                not give a direct explanation, so the answer cannot be definitive. \n                However, there would appear to be several good reasons. Shepherding \n                was, and still is to a certain extent, a very common occupation \n                for those in the Middle East. The Patriarchs were all shepherds, \n                as was Moses and of course David. (It was to shepherds in the \n                field that the news of the birth of Christ was first revealed!) \n                The terrain and geography of the area lend itself to the raising \n                of both sheep and goats, but in particular sheep. There is scarcity \n                of grass and less than abundant sources of water. Sheep are moved \n                from one area to another with relative ease and require less water \n                than other domestic animals. Everyone was familiar with shepherding \n                --- to say the people to whom the scriptures were first written \n              had a working knowledge of the concept would indeed be an understatement.</p>\n              <p>However, it may be most noteworthy \n                to realize that leaders and rulers being called shepherds was \n                not exclusive to the Bible or for that matter to the nation of \n                Israel. King Hammurabi of Babylon called himself a shepherd<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote1anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/shepherd.htm#sdendnote1sym\"><sup>1</sup></a></sup>, \n                and Homer regularly styles the Greek chiefs as shepherds of their \n                people.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote2anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/shepherd.htm#sdendnote2sym\"><sup>2</sup></a></sup> \n                In fact, history has shown, &#x93;from ancient antiquity rulers \n                were described as demonstrating their legitimacy to rule by their \n                ability to &#x91;pasture&#x92; their people.&#x94;<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote3anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/shepherd.htm#sdendnote3sym\"><sup>3</sup></a></sup> \n                This makes sense then of verses like those found in Jer. 49:19 \n                and 50:44, where God asks, &#x93;<i>who is the shepherd who can \n                stand against me</i>?&#x94; In this connection, the royal staff, \n                or scepter, a common accessory for kings in the Ancient Near East, \n                was itself a form of shepherd&#x92;s rod. Shepherds commonly used \n                long poles such as these to poke around crevices in caves to scare \n                out scorpions and snakes.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote4anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/shepherd.htm#sdendnote4sym\"><sup>4</sup></a></sup> \n                It came to be a symbol of protection, power and authority. Even \n                in Egypt, a divine symbol of kingship was the shepherd&#x92;s \n                crook.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote5anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/shepherd.htm#sdendnote5sym\"><sup>5</sup></a></sup> \n                It is true that the idea of shepherd as leader was not exclusive \n                to the Bible. However, what we will find is that God as the ultimate \n                shepherd of His people takes this concept to a level not present \n              in other cultures.</p>\n              <p>As we look at the characteristics \n                of a good shepherd it will become clear that God chose this motif \n                at least in part because His people are so apt to act like sheep. \n                Scriptures like Is. 53:6 remind us over and over again that God&#x92;s \n                people and sheep are very much alike and the connection is most \n                often negative. &#x93;Sheep are not only dependent creatures; \n                singularly unintelligent, prone to wandering and unable to find \n                their way to a shepherd even when it is in sight.&#x94;<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote6anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/shepherd.htm#sdendnote6sym\"><sup>6</sup></a></sup> \n                The analogy is fitting. It is clear, because of our helplessness \n                and our tendency to wander and get lost we are in need of a Good \n              Shepherd. </p>\n              <p><a name=\"Thecharacteristicsofagoodshepherd\"><b>The \n              characteristics of a good shepherd</b></a></p>\n              <p>The Bible sketches out in great detail \n                what a good shepherd would look like both in the Psalms and in \n                the words of Christ himself. However, before turning to these \n                descriptions it will be beneficial to consider in the broadest \n                terms what the focus of a leader of God&#x92;s people should be, \n                and in specific how the poor leaders of Israel failed in this \n              regard.</p>\n              <p>The focus of a good shepherd was \n                to be on his flock--their provision, guidance and safety. The \n                epitome of the bad shepherds, in Ezekiel&#x92;s expose of Israel&#x92;s \n                leaders of his day (34:1-6), sketches out in vivid terms, what \n                it looked like when leaders failed to provide this care. These \n                leaders were slaughtering their sheep for their own gain rather \n                than feeding them. ( This calls to mind the hireling of John 10:10, \n                who comes only to steal, kill and destroy and also of Jesus&#x92;scathing \n                rebuke of the Pharisees in Matthew 23.) Rather than caring for \n                the flock, they treated them with &#x93;<i>force and severity</i>&#x94;. \n                (vs.4) Perhaps Ezekiel&#x92;s greatest rebuke was for their lack \n                of guidance. This is emphasized here (and in other passages). \n                Three times he mentions that the sheep are scattered. They were \n                lost, became prey for every beast and had no one to search or \n                seek them. (vs.6) Jeremiah, in his judgment of the leaders of \n                Israel took this notion on step further, connecting a lack of \n                spirituality on the leaders part with the scattering of the sheep. \n                In Jer. 10:21 he states, no doubt in reference to the captivity \n                of Judah, &#x93;<i>For the shepherds have become stupid, and have \n                not sought the Lord; Therefore they have not prospered, and all \n              their flock is scattered.&#x94;</i></p>\n              <p>Knowing that the bad shepherd fails \n                to provide for the sheep, protect the sheep and guide the sheep, \n                the picture of the good shepherd laid out in scripture comes into \n                clearer view. The most famous description of the good shepherd, \n                and perhaps one of the most well known passages in the Bible, \n                is Psalm 23. These lines were penned by David, not a theoretician \n                when it came to sheep and their welfare, but a proven shepherd. \n                (David&#x92;s ability as a shepherd was clearly connected with \n                God using him to masterfully lead Israel. In Ps. 78:70-72 we read, \n                &#x93; <i>He also chose Davis His servant, And took him</i> <i>from \n                the sheepfolds; From the care of the ewes with sucking lams He \n                brought him, To shepherd Jacob His people, and Israel His inheritance</i>. \n                <i>So he shepherded them</i> <i>according to the integrity of \n                his heart, And guided them with his skillful hands</i>.&#x94;) \n                Entire books have been written detailing the work and nature of \n                the shepherd in Psalm 23. What follows attempts to highlight some \n                of the more important points of the shepherd&#x92;s provision \n              for his flock.</p>\n              <p>The good shepherd provides nourishment \n                and refreshment for his sheep. In verse 2 we are told he causes \n                the sheep to lie down in green pastures. This indicates a place \n                to rest but also a supply of food on hand. Also present is water \n                that is welcoming in addition to refreshing. This met a critical \n                need due to the shortage of water in the region as already pointed \n              out.</p>\n              <p>Later in the Psalm David conveys \n                the idea of abundant provision in yet another way. He speaks of \n                a table being set, his cup overflowing, and his head being anointed \n                with oil. Bedouin hospitality often called for just such a lavish \n                response to a guest, and the anointing with oil was a symbol of \n                lavish generosity and goodness on behalf of a hostess for their \n                guest. (Ecc. 9:8) David points out that the skilled shepherd MAKES \n                them lie down (vs.2), LEADS them (vs.2) and GUIDES them (vs.3). \n                He provides guidance which is so critical for sheep that are by \n                their nature apt to stray or wander into danger because they are \n                so helpless. This was a critical aspect of leadership and the \n                very reason given for Joshua being appointed to carry on for Moses \n                in Num. 27:15 &#x96;17. It is interesting to note that David is \n                aware that the shepherd provides in this way not because of the \n                inherent worthiness of the sheep, but because of the reputation \n                of the shepherd. Also, the picture here is of the shepherd leading \n                the way. Sheep in the East are not driven like in the West due \n                to differences in the terrain. For the most part, in the East \n                the shepherd goes ahead of the sheep, choosing the way to go. \n              </p>\n              <p>Not only did the shepherd provide \n                nourishment and direction, but David goes out of his way in the \n                Psalm to convey the idea of the shepherd providing safety and \n                protection. Sheep are extremely skittish and fearful, but the \n                shepherd was equipped to protect the sheep. The rod, which was \n                more of a club, was use to ward off wild animals and robbers. \n                The staff, as we have seen already was used to protect form scorpions \n                and snakes. As a result the sheep were safe, even walking through \n                the valley of the Shadow of Death--literally the valley of deepest \n                darkness. ( The shepherd himself is able to enjoy a banquet in \n                the presence of his enemies too, vs.5.) Isaiah understood this \n                about the good shepherd as well. In Is.40:11 he pictures the Shepherd&#x92;s \n                protection by pointing out his care for the most helpless of the \n                flock. The newborn and the nursing mothers with young are the \n                members most vulnerable to attack. &#x93;<i>Like a shepherd He \n                will tend His flock, In His arm He will gather the lambs, and \n                carry them in His bosom; He will gently</i> <i>lead the nursing \n              ewes</i>.&#x94;</p>\n              <p>In Jesus&#x92; description of Himself \n                in John 10 he adds to our understanding of what makes for a good \n                shepherd. The good shepherd is sacrificial. He is willing to ignore \n                his own needs in order to meet the needs of the sheep. Over and \n                over in the passage he states the good shepherd gives his own \n                life for his sheep. (vs.11, 15, 17, 18) In addition to this, though, \n                Jesus&#x92; audience understood the sacrificial nature of the \n                shepherd in His discussion of the sheepfold. When sheep were penned \n                in at night outside the city, the shepherd himself would often \n                construct a makeshift fold. He would take brush and bushes and \n                construct them in a &#x93;u&#x94; shape or some other formation \n                depending on what was already at hand. He would then place thorny \n                branches on top of the brush to both inhibit the sheep from jumping \n                out and from wild animals and thieves jumping into the enclosure \n                to hurt or kill the sheep. ( Robbers would accomplish their goal \n                by climbing over the enclosure, slitting the throat of the sheep \n                and heaving the body/ bodies over the wall. This helps explain \n                John 10:1.) The only way in and out of the fold was through a \n                space he would leave open. The shepherd himself would actually \n                lie across the opening, becoming the door in and out of the sheepfold. \n                The shepherd&#x92;s own comfort and sleep were secondary to the \n                comfort and safety of the sheep. Additionally, we know too from \n                the story told in Luke 15 that a worthy shepherd indeed does go \n                and search for a lost sheep. He is willing to make this effort \n                unlike the worthless shepherds already mentioned who allow the \n                sheep to wander and be preyed upon. Jesus finalizes the notion \n                of the sheeps&#x92; security by stating in John 10:28,29 that with \n              Him they are eternally secure.</p>\n              <p>The other characteristic of the good \n                shepherd Jesus makes crystal clear in his discussion of the topic \n                in John 10, is that the good shepherd is personally, if not intimately \n                involved with all his sheep. His closeness with the individual \n                sheep is clear in vs. 3 when it says he calls them by name. From \n                Nathan&#x92;s story in 2 Sam.12, we know that sheep were sometimes \n                given the status of pet. In fact, so close were the shepherd with \n                their flock that one shepherd is reported to been able to tell \n                which lamb went with which nursing mother in the dark by merely \n                feeling it&#x92;s head!<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote7anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/shepherd.htm#sdendnote7sym\"><sup>7</sup></a></sup> \n                The shepherd is also involved enough with his flock that they \n                know his voice. In this day multiple flocks would sometimes be \n                brought into the sheepfold for the night. The next day each shepherd \n                in turn would stand in the middle of the fold and call his own \n                out. It was not a matter of the exact call or words used, but \n                the sheep responded primarily to the distinct tone of the shepherd&#x92;s \n              voice.</p>\n              <p>In summary, the good shepherd showed \n                great concern for his sheep. He provided for them in terms of \n                nourishment and rest. He guided them, leading the way. He was \n                intimately involved with the flock and concerned for the safety \n                of each individual. He was willing to sacrifice his own comfort, \n              even his own life, for the sake of his sheep.</p>\n              <p>This is the kind of love and care \n                with which God wanted His rulers to lead Israel in the Old Testament, \n                and the writers of the New Testament have much of this in mind \n                when it comes to leadership in the church. It was in this context \n                that Jesus challenged Peter to prove his love after his betrayal. \n                After each admission of love on Peter&#x92;s part Jesus said, \n                &#x93;<i>Tend My lambs</i>&#x94; John 21:15, &#x93;<i>Shepherd \n                my sheep</i>&#x94; vs.16, and &#x93;<i>Tend my</i> <i>sheep</i>&#x94; \n                vs.17. Peter charges the elders at the churches in present day \n                Asia Minor to &#x93;<i>shepherd the flock of God among you, not \n                under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; \n                and not for sordid gain, but with eagerness; nor yet as lording \n                it over</i> <i>those allotted to your charge, but proving to be \n              examples to the flock</i>.&#x94; (1Peter 5:2-3)</p>\n              <p>Understanding the level of love, \n                commitment and sacrifice expended by the shepherd on behalf of \n              the sheep raises the bar for those who seek to lead in the church.</p>\n              <p>As mentioned earlier, the record \n                of this kind of leadership in the Old Testament was abysmal, with \n                the exception of David and a few others. Israel&#x92;s leaders \n                failed to be shepherds of this description. As a result prophets \n                in the Old Testament looked forward to a time when a truly good \n                shepherd would come. In the next section we will explore who that \n              person would be and when He would come.</p>\n              <p><a name=\"TheidentityoftheshepherdinOldTestamentprophesyandwhenhewouldcome\"><b>The \n                identity of the shepherd in Old Testament prophesy and when he \n              would come</b></a></p>\n              <p>There are numbers of passages in \n                the OT that make reference to a shepherd who is to come and who \n                is to play a significant role in the history of Israel. In the \n                case of Is. 44:28 the shepherd is actually named--Cyrus. In the \n                remaining passages, the identity of the shepherd is unknown. In \n                this section of the paper we will explore the major passages in \n                the scripture that deal with the shepherd where his identity is \n                unknown. Most passages that refer to the coming shepherd are clear \n                as to this person being the Messiah. What is not as clear is when \n                He will come and what He will do at that time. Where appropriate, \n                we will investigate what meaning these passages had for their \n                original audience and what they might mean for us today. We will \n                also look at Ezek. 34: 23, where there is some controversy concerning \n                the shepherd&#x92;s identity. Here we will argue that the person \n              of the shepherd is the Messiah. </p>\n              <p>Most passages referring to the coming \n                shepherd are connected with the ultimate restoration of Israel \n                which will take place at Christ&#x92;s Second Coming. One of the \n                most striking of these predictions is Is. 40:11. In the midst of \n                the warning about the coming hardship of captivity, Isaiah lifts \n                the eyes of his countrymen to a time when God will fully restore \n                all things. The global scope of the language, &#x93;<i>Let every</i> \n                <i>valley be lifted up&#x85;that the glory of the Lord will be \n                revealed</i>&#x94; argues for a time frame of the Second Coming. \n                According to vs.10, at this time He is coming in judgment and \n                might; &#x93;<i>Behold, the Lord God will come with might, With \n                His arm ruling for Him. Behold His reward is with Him, And His \n                recompense before Him</i>.&#x94; However, Isaiah goes out of his \n                way in the next verse to picture God in the most tender and nurturing \n                terms. &#x93;<i>Like a shepherd he will tend His flock, In His \n                arm He will gather the lambs, And carry</i> <i>them in His bosom; \n                He will gently lead the nursing ewes</i>.&#x94; Provision and \n                care are inherent in this image of the ruling shepherd who is \n                to come. This would not be missed by Isaiah&#x92;s audience. In \n                chapter 49:8-10 Isaiah expands on this same theme, although not actually \n                using the term shepherd. &#x93;<i>Thus says the Lord, &#x91;In \n                a favorable time I have answered You, And in a day of salvation \n                I have helped You; And I will keep You and give You for a covenant \n                of the people, To restore the land, to make them inherit the desolate \n                heritages; Saying to those who are bound, Go Forth, To those who \n                are in darkness, Show Yourselves, Along the roads they will feed, \n                And their pasture will be on all bare heights. They will not hunger \n                or thirst, Neither will the scorching heat or sun strike them down; \n                For He who has compassion on them will lead them, And will guide \n                them to springs of water</i>.&#x94; Isaiah&#x92;s sees a time \n                when the Lord of Hosts will appear as judge, which is a time to \n                be feared especially for the enemies of His people. Yet because \n                the nurturing care of His flock, a time to be anticipated with \n                excitement as well. No doubt these words were words of comfort \n                to Isaiah&#x92;s audience as they headed into a dark time. These \n                words should be a comfort for us as well as we too wait for the \n              Judge and Shepherd to return.</p>\n              <p>In Jer. 31:10-17 we find an emphasis \n                not on a future Messiah coming as shepherd, but on God&#x92;s \n                omniscience over the events in Israel&#x92;s history. Jeremiah \n                declares, &#x93;<i>Hear the word of the Lord, O nations. And declare \n                in the coastlands afar off , And say, &#x91;He who</i> <i>scattered \n                Israel will gather him, And keep him as a shepherd keeps his flock</i>.&#x92;&#x94; \n                vs.10 God oversaw and allowed the scattering of His people for \n                their disobedience, and in His omniscience He will bring them \n                back. Again, scripture connects the scattering of God&#x92;s flock \n                as a hurtful and damaging thing. His promise to bring them back \n                together, restoring them to the land, which He did in part in \n                after the Babylonian captivity, conveyed great comfort to His \n                people then in exile. They did not get where they were by accident, \n                and the same God who scattered His people would see that they \n                came back together. This truth, that God oversees and directs \n                history (in a broad sense) should be a comfort to us as well. \n                This is a passage that is typical of many prophecies in the Old \n                Testament. It was fulfilled in part with the return of Judah to \n                the land after the Babylonian captivity. It was further fulfilled \n                when modern day Israel was restored to the land in 1948, and it \n                will be completely fulfilled (to the top of the cup) when Christ \n              comes back to establish His kingdom once and for all. </p>\n              <p>In Micah 5:2-5a we find another reference \n                to the future shepherd of Israel. Here we see elements of the \n                prophesy fulfilled at the first coming of Christ, but other aspects \n                that will be completed at His second coming. Bethlehem is mentioned \n                as the place where a ruler of Israel will go forth. Matthew 2:5-6 saw this fulfilled in Christ&#x92;s first coming. In \n                vs.4 it states &#x93;<i>And He will arise and shepherd His flock, \n                In the strength of the Lord, In the majesty of the name of the \n                Lord His God. And they</i> <i>will remain, Because</i> <i>at that \n                time He will be great</i>.&#x94; The language here suggests the \n                global knowledge of Christ which will take place at His Second \n                Coming. (Micah goes on to speak of the global peace Israel will \n                experience at that time as well.) Again, these words were words \n                of comfort to Micah&#x92;s audience, especially in view of the \n                failure of the nation&#x92;s leaders of that day to properly care \n                for their flock. The triumphal language that follows (vs.5-9) \n                provided great comfort for Micah&#x92;s hearers as well. The church \n                today, though not in the same situation can look forward to living \n                in a state where our shepherd will at last &#x93;be great to the \n              ends of the earth&#x94; and that &#x93;He will be our peace.&#x94;</p>\n              <p>When it comes to Zechariah&#x92;s \n                mention of the shepherd to come, the line between fulfillment \n                at Christ&#x92;s first and Second Coming becomes even more blurred. \n                Zechariah&#x92;s prophecies are largely concerned with events \n                at the end of history and the Second Coming of Christ. His imagery \n                is often apocalyptic in nature and difficult to interpret. However, \n                the gospel writers saw some of the events foreshadowed there as \n                having to do with Christ&#x92;s first coming. For example, in \n                the very complicated passage of Zech. 11:11-12, the speaker (the \n                true shepherd?) asks for his wages. He receives 30 pieces of silver, \n                which God then tells him to throw to the potter (a gesture of \n                disdain and disregard.) Some see this prophecy fulfilled in Matt. 26:14-16, \n                when Judas betrayed Christ. Matthew carefully points out the exact \n                price of his betrayal. Likewise in Zech. 13:7-9 there is mention \n                of the sheep being scattered when the shepherd is struck down. \n                Matthew 26:31 saw the fulfillment of this in the disciples&#x92; \n                forsaking Christ the night He was arrested. Out of context this \n                interpretation may seem a very clear fit. However in context it \n                is not so clear. Just prior to the scattering of the sheep, it \n                refers to the awakening of a \"<i>sword</i> <i>against God&#x92;s \n                Shepherd, and against the man, My Associate</i>\". (!!) (Some \n                believe this last person referenced to be the Anti-Christ!) The \n                verse ends with a remnant declaring, &#x93;<i>The Lord is my God</i>&#x94;. \n                Is this the remnant gathered together at Christ&#x92;s Second \n                Coming? These passages seem particularly unclear in terms of the \n                time of the Shepherd&#x92;s coming or what He will do, and yet \n                the gospel writers view them as at least fulfilled in part in \n              Jesus&#x92;s lifetime. </p>\n              <p>Perhaps the most interesting of the \n                OT prophecies concerning the shepherd of the future is in Ezek. 34. \n                After Ezekiel extensively rebukes the shepherds of Israel for \n                their abysmal failure to lead the people as God would have them, \n                (vs.1-10), God interjects an unmistakable ray of hope. He says, \n                (vs.11) &#x93;<i>I myself will search for my sheep and seek</i> \n                <i>them out</i>.&#x94; He then goes on in beautiful imagery to \n                paint the picture of the Good Shepherd searching for and restoring \n                the lost and scattered sheep. He will return them to the land \n                and feed them on the mountains of Israel. (vs.13-14) He will bind \n                up the broken and strengthen the sick, but at the same time will \n                come with judgment. (vs.16) In vs.17-19 we see He will execute \n                judgment not only on the leaders, but also on individual members \n                of the flock, some of whom have demonstrated the same self interest \n                as the leaders. (vs.12) There is total restoration of the nation \n                of Israel and they enter in to a time of abundance and blessing. \n                (vs. 25-31) This would appear, quite clearly, to be a prediction \n                of the Second Coming of Christ and the final restoration of the \n                true Israel. However, in vs. 23 and 24 we read &#x91;<i>Then I \n                will set over them one shepherd, My servant</i> <i>David, and \n                he will feed them; he will feed them himself and be their shepherd. \n                And I, the Lord, will be their God, and My servant David will \n                be prince among them; I, the Lord</i>, <i>have spoken</i>.&#x94; \n                The mention here of David, for some is particularly controversial. \n                Rather than the shepherd being Christ, they see David as God&#x92;s \n                shepherd, servant and prince. &#x93;However, nothing in Ezekiel \n                34:23 demands that Ezekiel was not referring to the literal King \n                David who will be resurrected to serve as Israel&#x92;s righteous \n                prince.&#x94;<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote8anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/shepherd.htm#sdendnote8sym\"><sup>8</sup></a></sup> \n                They argue that later in Ezek. 37:34-35 there is mention again \n                of David. Here he is king and prince forever. David appears in \n                the future predictions of Jer. 30:9 and Hos.3:5. In Ezek. 45:22, \n                and 45:4 there is mention of sin offerings taking place in the \n                millennium. These scholars (Walvoord) argue that it would be inappropriate \n                for Jesus to offer such sacrifices, but appropriate for David \n                the prince. From these lines of reason the conclusion is drawn \n                that the shepherd mentioned here is not Christ but a literal resurrected \n              David. </p>\n              <p>Aside from the obvious problem of \n                dealing with Jesus Himself claiming to be the Good Shepherd, (and \n                the writers of the NT agreeing with Him as in 1 Peter 2:25, Heb. 13:20 \n                etc.) this conclusion ignores the marvelously deliberate and intricate \n                way the scripture identifies Jesus with David. The promise to \n                David from earliest times was that His descendent would be on \n                the throne of Israel forever, not David himself. There is an eternal \n                aspect to the kingship of David&#x92;s line that he humanly could \n                never fulfill. However, it was understood by all, including David \n                himself that God would establish one of his descendants to sit \n                on the throne eternally. Jesus was that descendent. Matthew&#x92;s \n                gospel from chapter 1 onward strives to make that point. Over \n                and over again he refers to Jesus as the Son of David. The Jews \n                knew the Messiah had to be a son of David. This causes them to \n                ask in Mt. 12:23 &#x93;<i>This man cannot be the Son of David, \n                can he</i>?&#x94; The answer to that question, though they didn&#x92;t \n                believe it was &#x93;YES&#x94;. Jesus was the great and final \n                descendant of David. Paul in trying to persuade the Jews that \n                Christ was the Messiah makes this argument in Acts 13:23 and again \n                in 13:34-36. Peter too points out that Jesus was in fact the son \n                of David promised in the scripture. Acts 2:21-36 Jesus boldly \n                asserts that not only is He the offspring of David, the very one \n                that David anticipated, but He was God at the same time. Matt. 22:43, \n                Mk. 12:35, Lk. 20:42 all record Jesus forcing the Jews to think through \n                His identity by considering what David says in Ps.110. How like \n                God to so fantastically tie Jesus in with the line of David to \n                fulfill that promise to sit on the throne forever. How like God \n                it is that He Himself, not a resurrected David, is the Good Shepherd \n                and as the Good Shepherd the final king for His people. This was \n                always His desire. He allowed for a human king as a concession \n                to his rebellious children, (I Sam. 8:7) but it was His desire \n              to rule and care for His children from the beginning.</p>\n              <p>Walvoord also argues that David, \n                not Christ will preside over sacrifice in the Millennial Kingdom. \n                The problem with this argument has more to do with the nature \n                of the Kingdom to come than who is officiating as priest. The \n                true question concerns the idea of sacrifice for sin in the Millennial \n                Kingdom. Why would God bring back a system that he declared insufficient \n                and obsolete over and over in the book of Hebrews? Why would it \n                be reinstated after hundreds of years? It seems to make no sense. \n                All other authors of the scripture speak metaphorically when referring \n                to the kingdom to come. It is very hard to understand why Ezekiel \n                alone would describe it in literal terms. It is not hard to understand, \n                though, that the exiled priests who made up part of Ezekiel&#x92;s \n                audience would view the return of the sacrificial system as part \n                of that which God would ultimately restore. This was no doubt \n                something they longed for in their years of captivity. Ezekiel, \n                again in speaking words of comfort to the people of his day could \n                have included notions of the sacrificial system in his depiction \n              of the kingdom to come.</p>\n              <p>In conclusion, it would seem that \n                this passage in Ezekiel, like the others, looks forward to the \n                coming of the Messiah, not David as the Good Shepherd of his people. \n                As was the case with the other references to His coming to regather \n                and care for his sheep, God intended to give hope and encouragement \n                to the people of Ezekiel&#x92;s day. Knowing that a day would \n                come when God would &#x93;<i>feed His flock and lead them to rest</i>&#x94; \n                (Ez. 34:15) was meant to bring them comfort in a day when they \n                were cut off from their land, and seemingly cut off from their \n                God. In the midst of the darkness God wanted them not to despair, \n              but to know He had great plans for them. (Jer. 29:11)</p>\n              <p>The final prophecy of the shepherd \n                to be considered is Mt. 25:32-34. &#x93;<i>And all the nations \n                will be gathered before Him; and he will separate from one another, \n                as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats; And He will \n                put the sheep on His</i> <i>right, and the goats on the left</i>.&#x94; \n                In this passage the shepherd goes on to direct the sheep (the \n                righteous-vs.37, 46) to the kingdom prepared from the foundation \n                of the world, and the goats, to eternal punishment. The metaphor \n                here relates to the fact that often a shepherd tended a mixed \n                flock of both sheep and goats. (In a similar way we say judgment \n                between individual sheep, as well as between sheep and goats in \n                Ezekiel 34.) There were times when the two groups needed to be \n                separated. This was a common part of the shepherding job, clearly \n                understood by Jesus&#x92; audience. These passages teach that \n                the Good Shepherd will come to judge between individuals at the \n                end of the age. For those who are His, these were meant to be \n              words of comfort. For those who were not, words of great sobriety.</p>\n              <p>In conclusion, the OT scripture does \n                look forward to the coming of the Good Shepherd. As God&#x92;s \n                Messiah, Jesus fulfilled this prophetic role in some measure in \n                His first coming. He will complete it in His second coming, however, \n                when He will come in judgment to separate the righteous from those \n                who did not know Him, and to finally care for and lead those that \n              are His own. </p>\n              \n              <p>Davis, John J. <i>The Perfect Shepherd; \n                Studies in the 23 Psalm</i>.

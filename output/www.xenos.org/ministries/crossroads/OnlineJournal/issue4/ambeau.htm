The film presents different \n              ways people relate and respond to grace and elegance. \"Look \n              closer.\" The words are never spoken- but it's the film's central \n              theme. Those words are written on a card hanging on the wall of \n              the main character's cubicle at work. The turning points in the \n              film all hinge on either a character's ability to look closer at \n              their lives or their failure to do so. \n              <p>It is appropriate that a movie that \n                puts so much emphasis on recognizing beauty is itself a very beautiful \n                film. American Beauty showcases a brilliant use of color, inventive \n                use of the camera and special effects, and also gives us great \n                performances from talented actors. Cinematographer Conrad Hall \n                is able to convey the mood of the film with just color alone. \n                He peppers the drab, beige interiors of the Burnhams' home with \n                rich, deep, reds (the color of roses and blood.) First-time screenwriter \n                Alan Ball gives us a script that boldly steers clear of typical \n                and safe Hollywood writing conventions and instead delivers a \n                fresh and sometimes unnerving blend of social satire and domestic \n                tragedy. Big-screen newcomer, director Sam Mendes, does a fabulous \n                job of bringing together all the different elements of the film \n                into one cohesive work of art. </p>\n              <p>Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is \n                narrating the story from beyond the grave and in a way he is already \n                dead. Lester is in a rut. He hates his job. Lester's wife Carolyn \n                (Annette Bening) and daughter Jane (Thora Birch) both think he \n                is pathetic. He is in a joyless marriage and never shows any interest \n                in the life of his daughter. He is cynical, weak, and never stands \n                up for himself. He feels sedated and is no longer happy. However, \n                he believes it is never too late to change. </p>\n              <p>His decision to make changes comes \n                in response to meeting his teenage daughter's gorgeous and well-proportioned \n                friend, Angela (Mena Suvari). He starts working out because he \n                wants to look good naked after overhearing that Angela would have \n                sex with him if he was in better shape. Later on he quits his \n                job and blackmails his company out of tens of thousands of dollars. \n                With added freedom, Lester begins to relax, enjoy his life again, \n                and seek after all that brings him pleasure. </p>\n              <p>The Burnham's new next door neighbors \n                are just as dysfunctional. Marine Corps Colonel and closet homosexual \n                Frank Fitts and his nearly catatonic wife have only one child, \n                18 year old Ricky (Wes Bentley). The boy sells pot to Lester Burnham \n                and helps him revisit his own teenage years. Ricky is a little \n                odd and mysterious, videotaping everything he finds interesting. \n                He believes there is a benevolent force that can be seen through \n                beautiful things that tells him that everything is ok and that \n                there is no reason to be afraid. And he is not. He is firm in \n                his beliefs, confident, smart, and strong-willed. </p>\n              <p>The use of music in American Beauty \n                clearly illustrates the gap between fantasy and reality. There \n                are three fantasy scenes in which Lester has near sexual encounters \n                with young Angela. She is mostly naked in these scenes, covered \n                in rose pedals and soap bubbles. For these scenes, Thomas Newman \n                put together some exotic, experimental music that includes the \n                use of gongs, metallaphones, drums, power tool sounds, and animal \n                cries to express feelings of forbidden desire and voracity. </p>\n              <p>Near the end of the movie Lester \n                has an actual sexual encounter with Angela. We hear an altogether \n                different kind of music during this rather stark and unsettling \n                scene in which Lester undresses a 16 year old girl. It is a very \n                straightforward piano composition in a minor key. Over this soft, \n                delicate music we can hear Angela's nervous, heavy breathing. \n                The reality of being intimate with this young woman was not as \n                Lester had expected. To his credit, he saw that there was something \n                beautiful in Angela's innocence and does not have sex with her. \n                </p>\n              <p>I think the popularity of this movie \n                reveals that American society is interested in the polite, nonjudgmental \n                God that Ricky Fitts believes in. It is comforting to think that \n                we can ignore sin in our lives so long as we don't ignore beauty. \n                This movie makes a few good points about the need to change a \n                mundane life. However the answers presented leaves the viewer \n                with vague notations of relativism and skips over the moral implications \n                of people's choices. </p>\n              <p>Certainly God does not want us to \n                ignore beauty. The first thing God did was create wonderful, amazing \n                things. In Genesis chapter one after He created things each day \n                He said that those things were good. After creating people He \n                looked at everything and said that it was very good. God delights \n                in beauty. Paul tells us in Phil 4:8 to meditate on lovely, praiseworthy \n                things: \"Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is \n                noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, \n                whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think \n                about such things.\" It's through the natural world that God \n                speaks to people like Ricky Fitts in Romans 1:20: \"For since \n                the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal \n                power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood \n                from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.\" \n                Unfortunately, Ricky didn't see that these wonderful qualities \n                belonged to his Creator and Lord. </p>\n              <p>Paul reveals to us two very important \n                responses we should have to God's creation in Romans 1:21: \"For \n                although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor \n                gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their \n                foolish hearts were darkened.\" </p>\n              <p>First God wants us to give Him glory. \n                He wants us to rejoice triumphantly in the light of every good \n                thing that He has done: all the things He's created that we find \n                wonderful, all the things He is doing for us, all that He will \n                to for us, and everything He has done for us. God is interested \n                in everything and everyone pointing back to Him and saying, \"God \n                is responsible for all majestic beauty and splendor in heaven \n                and on earth!\" </p>\n              <p>A natural response to God's glory \n                is to give Him praise. C.S. Lewis sums up the purpose for praise \n                and worship very well in his book \"Reflections on the Psalms, \n                \"I think we delight to praise what we enjoy because the praise \n                not merely expresses but completes the enjoyment; it is its appointed \n                consummation. It is not out of compliment that lovers keep on \n                telling one another how beautiful they are; the delight is incomplete \n                till it is expressed.\" </p>\n              <p>Also, God tells us that He wants \n                us to thank Him when we see His beautiful work. Initially, the \n                idea of thankfulness might seem like mere courtesy or polite behavior. \n                However, failure to give God thanks is one of the reasons sighted \n                as cause for peoples' hearts to be darkened. Certainly gratitude \n                is more than simply maintaining proper decorum in the presence \n                of your God. The word gratitude comes from \"gratis\" \n                meaning without price or payment. To be grateful is to acknowledge \n                the goodwill behind the gifts we've received. After realizing \n                that God gives us good and wonderful gifts we should be appreciative \n                of the benefits we have received from those gifts. The other part \n                of gratitude is an emotional response. When we are thankful for \n                a gift we've received we spontaneously express the joy and pleasure \n                that we feel. It is this spontaneous expression of gladness that \n                God takes great delight in. </p>\n              <p>After we understand the importance \n                of giving God glory, praising Him, and giving Him thanks, there \n                are several things we need to do in order to stay awake to His \n                glory and not allow our thankfulness and praise to remain an intellectual \n                and emotional experience. In Hebrews chapters 11-12 we are encouraged \n                to respond to God and the faithfulness we can see in people. All \n                of chapter 11 looks at many great people of faith throughout history. \n                In Hebrews chapter 12:1 we have our proper response not only to \n                the faith of great people, but also to God's power and grace: \n                \"Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud \n                of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the \n                sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance \n                the race marked out for us.\" The writer of Hebrews is encouraging \n                us to wake up, get up, and do God's work. </p>\n              <p>God has wonderful plans for our lives \n                and wants to use our talents to bring Him glory and honor. We \n                should be doing all we can everyday to seek out His will for our \n                lives and then boldly go forward and do the work that He has created \n                us to do. What better place to get direction for your life than \n                from the God who designed you in the first place?</p>\n              <p>Copyright &#xA9; 2000 by Shane Scanlan\n            </p></td>\n          </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"American Beauty reviewed by Shane Scanlon","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/ambeau.htm"}

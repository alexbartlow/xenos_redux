Secular, Jewish and Christian experts agree that there are \n              numerous parallels between the &#x93;Law of Moses&#x94; and the \n              laws found in Mesopotamian legal collections.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote1anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/torahlaw.htm#sdendnote1sym\"><sup>1</sup></a></sup> \n              Even though most secular historians have concluded that not all \n              of the laws (or even any of the laws, for that matter) found in \n              Exodus, Leviticus and Deuteronomy were written by Moses, but by \n              later authors, there remains the general consensus that the biblical \n              codes have corollary aspects in content and wording to Ancient Near \n              Eastern (ANE) legal codes of the 13<sup>th</sup> to the 20<sup>th</sup> \n              centuries B.C. \n              <p>Yet, as one reads the Torah, one can&#x92;t escape major differences \n                from the ANE legal codes. &#x93;But just as biblical law has much \n                in common with the laws of Israel&#x92;s neighbors, so does it \n                differ in important respects.&#x94;<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote2anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/torahlaw.htm#sdendnote2sym\"><sup>2</sup></a></sup> \n                &#x93;It should be understood, of course, that the differences \n                between the Torah and <i>the</i> <i>Code of Hammurabi </i>are \n                far more striking than the resemblances&#x94;<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote3anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/torahlaw.htm#sdendnote3sym\"><sup>3</sup></a></sup> \n                As I read some of the ANE law codes that are used as comparisons \n                to the Mosaic Law, I saw those similarities, but I was more profoundly \n                arrested by some of the differences. One major difference is the \n                author. Yahweh, in the first person, is the one speaking and giving \n                the laws in the Mosaic laws, not a human king authoring or codifying \n                laws, as in<i> the code of Hammurabi </i>or the other ANE codes. \n                Stemming from this foundational difference are other important \n                differences which I will discuss in this paper. The three areas \n                of differences that I will focus on in this paper are the introduction \n                of the author in the Mosaic Law and the ANE texts, the motivation \n                for obedience to the laws of the Mosaic laws and the ANE texts; \n                and, finally, the character of God as expressed in the Mosaic \n                codes. There we will see his values expressed in His system of \n                civil laws and their penalties as compared to the ANE codes.</p>\n              <p>There are six generally accepted early legal codes that are used \n                as comparisons to the Mosaic laws. These are (1) the Ur-nammu \n                code, c. 2050 B.C. from the Third Dynasty of Ur; (2) the code \n                of Bilalama, c. 1925 B.C. from Eshnunna; (3) the code of Lipit-Ishtar, \n                c. 1860 B.C. from Isin; (4) the code of Harmmurabi, c. 1700 B.C. \n                from Babylon; (5) the Hittite code, c. 1450 B.C. from Boghazkoi; \n                and (6) the Assyrian code, c. 1350 B.C. from Assur.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote4anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/torahlaw.htm#sdendnote4sym\"><sup>4</sup></a></sup> \n                All have been translated into English, yet none has been found \n                in its entirety but in fragments, so some of the comparisons can \n                not be absolutely accurate. But even a surface investigation of \n                available ANE legal codes yields contrasts to the civil laws that \n                Moses mediated. </p>\n              <p><a name=\"AuthorIntroduction\"><b>Author Introduction</b></a></p>\n              <p>In contrast to the Hittite suzerain-vassal treaty parallels, \n                there are differences marking Yahweh&#x92;s giving of the Law \n                from the others. One difference is the content of the prologue \n                of the Mosaic code and the content found in the prologues of some \n                ANE legal codes. It is striking, for example, to read the description \n                of the king, Hammurabi in the prologue of <i>The Code of Hammurabi</i>. \n                This description was written by Hammurabi himself as evidenced \n                by the first person viewpoint. While the maintenance of justice \n                and the protection of the community were the two mandates given \n                to the chosen king by the gods<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote5anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/torahlaw.htm#sdendnote5sym\"><sup>5</sup></a></sup>, \n                what is displayed seems to be Hammurabi&#x92;s self-importance \n                as he lists his great accomplishments and lauds his position as \n                the favorite son of the gods. He is justifying his authority to \n                be the lawgiver and his power to carry out the laws and their \n                punishments if violated. The following is just a sample of the \n                glorious description Hammurabi bestows to himself in the lengthy \n                prologue of his legal code:</p>\n              \n              <p>&#x93;Anum \n                [the sky-god] and Enlil [the storm god] named me to promote the \n                welfare of the people, me, Hammurabi, the devout, god-fearing \n                prince to cause justice to prevail in the land, to destroy the \n                wicked And the evil, that the strong might not oppress the weak, \n                to rise like the sun over other people, to light up the land. \n                Hammurabi, the shepherd, called by Enlil, am I; the one who makes \n                affluence and plenty abound . . . who makes the name of Babylon \n                great . . . the pious, suppliant one, who brought abundance to \n                Esishnugal . . . the wise king&#x85;the designer of the temple \n                of Ebabbar, which is like heavenly dwelling . . . the warrior \n                . . . the fiery wild bull who gores the foe . . . the devout one&#x85;god \n                among king, acquainted with wisdom; who plumbed the depths of \n                wisdom . . . the first of kings . . . the chief of kings, a fighter \n                without peer . . . the ancient seed of royalty, the powerful king, \n                the sun of Babylon, who causes light to go forth over the lands \n                of Sumer and Akkad.&#x94;<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote6anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/torahlaw.htm#sdendnote6sym\"><sup>6</sup></a></sup> \n                </p>\n               \n              <p>The Lipit-Ishtar law code is not as complete as <i>the Code of \n                Hammurabi</i> and, consequently, its prologue as we have it is \n                not the entire prologue. Yet echoes of a similar magnificence \n                are in the description King Lipit-Ishtar gives himself:</p>\n              <p>&#x93;When the great Anu, \n                the father of the gods and Enlil, the king of all lands, the lord \n                who determines destinies . . . had called Lipit-Ishtar&#x97;Lipit-Ishtar, \n                the wise shepherd whose name has been pronounced by Numamnir [Enlil] \n                to the princeship of the land . . . then, I, Lipit-Ishtar, the \n                humble shepherd of Nippur, the stalwart farmer of Ur, who abandons \n                not Eridu, the suitable lord of Erech, I, who is fit for the heart \n                of Inanna . . . &#x93;<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote7anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/torahlaw.htm#sdendnote7sym\"><sup>7</sup></a></sup></p>\n              <p>Though Hammurabi and Lipit-Ishtar were not claiming to be deities, \n                they were claiming some authorship to the laws. They were not \n                claiming to be just mediators of deity-initiated laws and therefore \n                some comparison with Yahweh is warranted. </p>\n              <p><b></b>When God introduces Himself in the preamble, He only lists \n                one historical accomplishment. &#x94;I am the Lord who brought \n                you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery (Ex. 20:1)&#x94;. \n                Absent in this preamble is a long inventory of why God is worthy \n                of giving laws; absent is who sanctioned Him to give laws, or \n                which gods are pleased with Him. God doesn&#x92;t need to convince \n                the people of His authority to initiate laws, or His ability to \n                carry out the laws. He reminds them of the miracles they&#x92;ve \n                witnessed in the recent days and months in Egypt and in their \n                release from Egypt. They also witness His presence shrouded on \n                Mt. Sinai in Exodus 19. In Deuteronomy, the covenant renewal document, \n                Yahweh does review the last 40 years with His audience to remind \n                them of specific acts of power and mercy they have seen, but these \n                examples are to remind them that there is no other god who has \n                performed such tangible, miraculous events (Deut 5:32-38). I do \n                not get a sense of arrogance from Yahweh when He lists these miracles \n                as I did when I read the ANE prologues. While the mortal kings \n                needed to validate their positions of authority, God assumes His \n                with complete confidence. Yahweh appeals to no higher authority \n                because He alone is the highest authority. At Sinai where Moses \n                was given the law, God claims exclusive ownership of the entire \n                world, and from that position chooses Israel to be His covenant \n                nation (Ex. 19:5). God is the Great King. The moral man involved \n                in God&#x92;s law codes, Moses, is only a mediator of the covenant \n                and has not claims to authorship of the codes. He is only a transmitter \n                of the information as God tells him to write, while the two kings \n                above claim to have some level of authorship of their empires&#x92; \n                laws. </p>\n              <p><a name=\"MotivationforObedience\"><b>Motivation&#xA0; for&#xA0; \n                Obedience</b></a></p>\n              <p>Another difference between the civil laws given by Yahweh to \n                Israel and the ANE law codes is the foundational reasons for citizens \n                to uphold and obey the laws. George Mendenhall theorizes that \n                religious obligations tended to become legal obligations in the \n                Ancient Near Eastern law codes.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote8anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/torahlaw.htm#sdendnote8sym\"><sup>8</sup></a></sup> \n                In other words, the kings created laws which were sanctioned by \n                the deities; therefore, a violation of a law was an act contrary \n                to the will of the deity and consequently, would be punished directly \n                by the deity. For example, if the Babylonians, under Hammurabi, \n                didn&#x92;t follow the laws that Hammurabi had written and which \n                were sanctioned by the deities, the community would experience \n                punitive acts of the gods. For example, Enlil, the storm-god, \n                would withhold rain from the whole land and all of the people. \n                Other natural catastrophes, such as plagues and famines would \n                also be possible penalizing measures. Therefore, the community \n                would feel compelled to punish its perpetrators in order to protect \n                itself from the divine wrath which does not single out the culprit \n                alone for punishment. The laws were to be fearfully obeyed with \n                one eye on the deity. Centuries later, as the legal systems became \n                more authoritative, the link between religious obligations and \n                legal obligations weakened in Mesopotamia, but at the time of \n                the Old Testament law, other cultures functioned in this superstitious \n                relationship with their gods.</p>\n              <p>But the underlying reasons for obeying God&#x92;s civil laws \n                were deeper than just fear against punitive acts by God, and punishing \n                the guilty was for more than fearing the retribution of God. It \n                is true that God promises military defeat, famines, plagues and \n                droughts (Deut. 28) if His people, who covenanted themselves with \n                Him as His vassal, disregarded His laws. In fact, God is even \n                more specific, more definite in His consequences to Israel&#x92;s \n                future disobedience than the curses given in Hittite suzerain-vassal \n                treaties, as shown in these ANE treaty examples:</p>\n              <p>&#x93;If you, Kurtiwaza, \n                the prince, and [you] the sons of the Hurri country do not fulfill \n                the words of this treaty, may the gods, the lords of the oath, \n                blot you out&#x85;May they draw you like malt from its hull.

Yahweh is \n                very clear that He will bring specific acts of calamity and even \n                sends His prophets later to His people to warn them of these impending \n                judgments, why these judgment are coming coupled with a plea to \n                change their minds and return to Him. He warns them if they leave \n                Him and follow other gods in their detestable worship rituals, \n                He will send clear punishment their way. <sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote12anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/torahlaw.htm#sdendnote12sym\"><sup>12</sup></a></sup></p>\n              <b>\n              </b><p><a name=\"God'sCharacterReflectedintheLaw\">God's Character Reflected \n                in the Law</a></p>\n               \n              <p>God is equally unambiguous that He is setting up the nation&#x92;s \n                civil laws to accomplish more than just obedience for fear of \n                His retribution. God wanted His character to be visible to the \n                nations around the Israelites. He wanted to use their behavior \n                to show His character to the other nations; He wanted them to \n                be &#x93;holy&#x94; as He is &#x93;holy&#x94;. He wanted the Israelites \n                to experience &#x93;life&#x94; and not &#x93;death&#x94; (Deut.31:19,20). \n              </p>\n              <p>God had given the Israelites a specific mission. At Sinai, God \n                gave them their new identity: &#x93;You are to be a kingdom of \n                priests&#x94; (Ex. 19:6). As priests were to be mediators between \n                God and humanity, the Israelites were to be the representatives \n                of God to the nations. Not only was Israel going to be the nation \n                through which God&#x92;s rescue plan would be accomplished through \n                Jesus, but even during this nation&#x92;s infancy, it was to embody \n                who God is for the nations around them to see. The Jews were to \n                explain God&#x92;s character through their civil law system, which \n                will be discussed later in this paper. In connection with this \n                mission, the repetition of &#x93;you are to be holy, as I am holy&#x94; \n                throughout the Mosaic Law (Lev. 11:44, 45, 19:2, Deut. 7:6, 14:2) \n                is a foundational reason for why some of the laws created a distinctiveness \n                between the Israelites and the surrounding nations. They were \n                to be &#x93;set apart&#x94; from the other nations in how they \n                related to God, and how they related to each other. For instance, \n                when God gives the death penalty in certain cases, He explains \n                why the perpetrator of the crime must die: &#x93;You must purge \n                the evil from among you&#x94; (Deut. 13:5, 17:7, 17:12, 19:19, \n                21:21, 22:21, 24, 27). In these cases, God assigns a moral judgment \n                by calling the actions &#x93;evil&#x94;, which violates His character \n                and therefore must be punished. No reasons that I could find for \n                proscribed penalties are given in the ANE codes. In Deut. 6:20-25, \n                God tells the Jews to respond to their children&#x92;s questions \n                about the purpose of the laws by telling them that these laws \n                are &#x93;our righteousness&#x94;, or most likely, the way of \n                expressing a right connection to God by living a daily life aligned \n                with His character. This behavioral righteousness emerges from \n                a heart that is &#x93;right&#x94;, a heart that wants to obey \n                God. God did not want adherence to the civil laws externally, \n                He wanted them to obey as a logical response to the good He has \n                done and is doing for them. </p>\n              <p>Finally, God, though Moses, repeatedly states unambiguously that \n                obedience to these laws will &#x93;bring life and not death&#x94; \n                to the people (Deut. 30:19,20). The refrain &#x93;so that it may \n                go well with you&#x94; which Moses continuously reminds the people \n                in the covenant renewal was an invitation to peace, contentment, \n                and rest in God&#x92;s ways of interacting within families and \n                communities. In summary, the laws were to be obeyed not just to \n                punish themselves so the deity doesn&#x92;t punish the whole community, \n                the laws were to be obeyed to show the distinctiveness of God \n                to the world and to enjoy the fruits of &#x93;right living&#x94;. \n              </p>\n              <p><i>Justice, Generosity, and Truth</i></p>\n              <p>The laws given to the Israelites were an outflow of God&#x92;s \n                character. As one reads the laws, one gets a sense that the civil \n                laws stem from what matters to God, what God values. Sometimes \n                the value is stated, as in Exodus 23:26, 27, </p>\n              <p>&#x93;If you take your \n                neighbor&#x92;s cloak as a pledge, return it to him by sunset, \n                because his cloak is the only covering he has for his body. What \n                else will he sleep in? When he cries out to me, I will hear, <b>for</b> \n                <b>I am compassionate</b>&#x94;. </p>\n              <p>Justice, generosity and truth are three other \n                values that are reflected in the civil laws. All three are intertwined. \n                When you see God&#x92;s attitude toward justice, you also see \n                God&#x92;s attitude towards truth. Some civil laws reflect God&#x92;s \n                generosity in the midst of enacting justice. This final section \n                will explore how God expresses these three values in ways that \n                create differences from ANE texts, most notably, <i>the Code of \n                Hammurabi</i>. </p>\n              <p>In ancient Babylon, there were three distinct social classes: \n                the <i>amelu</i>, or patrician class, the <i>mushkinu</i>, or \n                the working class of commoners, and the slaves, who were little \n                more than chattel to their masters.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote13anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/torahlaw.htm#sdendnote13sym\"><sup>13</sup></a></sup> \n                Between these classes, the law made a very sharp distinction. \n                An offence committed against an <i>amelu</i>, was punished with \n                far more severity than if the sufferer had belonged to the second \n                order in the state, yet when an <i>amelu</i> was the aggressor \n                in violent affairs, he was punished more severely than his social \n                inferior.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote14anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/torahlaw.htm#sdendnote14sym\"><sup>14</sup></a></sup> \n                Note these examples:<sup> <a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote15anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/torahlaw.htm#sdendnote15sym\"><sup>15</sup></a></sup></p>\n              <p>&#x93;If a seignior accused \n                another seignior and brought a charge of murder against him, but \n                has not proved it, his accuser shall be put to death.&#x94; H.C. \n                #1</p>\n              <p>&#x93;If \n                a seignior has knocked out a tooth of a seignior of his own rank, \n                they shall knock out his tooth.&#x94; H.C. #200.

The use of bribes in Ex. 23:8 was \n                odious and reprehensible to God and society. Impartiality coupled \n                with kindness to enemies was obligatory in God&#x92;s nation (Ex. \n                23-4-5 with Deut. 22:1-3). God always attached His values to the \n                civil laws. &#x93;The moral aspect of the law is never far behind \n                the external demands in society, politics and ritual&#x94; <sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote17anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/torahlaw.htm#sdendnote17sym\"><sup>17</sup></a></sup></p>\n              <p>Along side of equality, God requires generosity in restitution \n                for the slaves who have been injured by a freeman. The following \n                law in Exodus is in direct contrast to the laws of injuring a \n                slave in <i>the Code of Hammurabi</i>:</p>\n              <p>&#x93;If a man hits a man \n                servant or maidservant in the eye and destroys it, he must let \n                the servant <b>go free </b>to compensate for the eye. And if he \n                knocks out the tooth of a manservant or maidservant, he must let \n                the servant<b> go free </b>to compensate for the tooth&#x94; (Ex. \n                21:26,27) </p>\n              <p>In fact, God commands the Israelites to be much more compassionate \n                towards slaves than the other ANE nations were. While other nations \n                treated their slaves like chattel, God commands the Israelites \n                to a principle of kindness and generosity. God gives poor Israelites \n                the option to redeem themselves with a fair price computed from \n                the number of years left to the Year of the Jubilee. God warns \n                the Israelites to &#x93;see to that that his [the slave] owner \n                does not rule over him ruthlessly&#x94; (Lev. 25:53). God commands \n                the Israelites to give generous gifts of food and livestock to \n                a Hebrew indentured servant, or slave, and his family in the seventh \n                year of service, the Sabbath year, when they are allowed to go \n                free (Deut. 15:12-18). In this section, as in others, God tells \n                his people why they are to be generous with slaves; they were \n                slaves once as well and God freed them. They can imitate God&#x92;s \n                generosity here as a statement of trust in God&#x92;s provisions \n                for them and as a statement of doing what is in the heart of God: \n                redemption. There are no interactions with deities like this in \n                the ANE codes that I read; there were no moral reasons attached \n                to laws. </p>\n              <p><i>Capital Punishment</i></p>\n              <p>While capital punishment does not seem to be an anomaly in Ancient \n                Near East societies, God reserves capital punishment for some \n                very different crimes than capital crimes found in other ANE law \n                codes. It is fascinating to catalog the amount of crimes against \n                property which carry the death penalty in <i>the Code of Hammurabi</i>, \n                and in <i>the Laws of Eshnunna</i>, and to catalog the numerous \n                crimes against a person that do not carry the death penalty. God \n                requires no capital punishment against crimes against property, \n                but has strict death sentences for crimes against people, even \n                when the crime committed was not the taking of a life. </p>\n              <p>&#x93;People, not property \n                were at the heart of Old Testament legislation. . . .Human life \n                is so sacred [to God] that whoever assails it is subject to forfeiting \n                his or her own life.&#x94;<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote18anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/torahlaw.htm#sdendnote18sym\"><sup>18</sup></a></sup> \n                </p>\n              <p>Violations involving another person&#x92;s life that require \n                a sentence of death for the guilty are deliberate murder, striking \n                a mother or father, kidnapping, and dishonoring one&#x92;s mother \n                and father (Ex. 21: 12-17). An owner of a bull that habitually \n                gores people to death and refuses to take precautions is allowed \n                to be put to death, though there is a provision for the owner \n                to redeem his life is he pays the demanded price (Ex. 21:28,29). \n                And because truth and life are so important to God, more than \n                one witness must be produced to proceed with capital punishment \n                (Num. 35:30, Deut. 17:6, 19:15). </p>\n              <p>The death penalty was required only if one&#x92;s young son had \n                been kidnapped in <i>the Code of Hammurabi</i><sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote19anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/torahlaw.htm#sdendnote19sym\"><sup>19</sup></a></sup>, \n                but God values both men and women, boys and girls and does not \n                specify the victim&#x92;s gender in a kidnapping (Ex. 21:16). \n                There is not a death penalty for murder in <i>the Hittite Codes</i>, \n                Tablet 1, #1-6; there is only a required monetary payment for \n                killing free men and women, male and female slaves.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote20anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/torahlaw.htm#sdendnote20sym\"><sup>20</sup></a></sup> \n                In the case of adultery, both the man and the woman caught in \n                the act are killed in the Bible (Lev. 20:10), showing equal justice \n                for both consenting adults, while only the adulteress is killed \n                in Law #28 in <i>the Laws of Eshnunna</i><sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote21anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/torahlaw.htm#sdendnote21sym\"><sup>21</sup></a></sup> \n                and <i>the Laws of Ur-Nammu</i>.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote22anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/torahlaw.htm#sdendnote22sym\"><sup>22</sup></a></sup></p>\n              <p>Stealing is condemned in both the Law of Moses and ANE codes, \n                but the penalty for stealing property is much harsher, even up \n                to death, in ANE codes.

No crimes against \n                property carry a death sentence. A thief who was caught in Israel \n                and could not make restitution, which was a more reasonable <b>four-fold \n                or five-fold</b>, was not killed, but only sold into slavery to \n                pay for his theft (Ex 22:3). In Israel, a property owner who in \n                broad daylight kills a thief is guilty of bloodshed because it \n                is not considered self-defense (Ex. 22:2). It is clear that God \n                values people more than property because even a thief who is killed \n                needlessly is valuable to God.</p>\n              <p><a name=\"Conclusion\"><b>Conclusion</b></a></p>\n              <p>One can not write about all of the differences between the Mosaic \n                Law code and the codes of the contemporary Ancient Near Eastern \n                law codes. A working society with order was a goal for the ANE \n                kings. Hammurabi set out to &#x93;seek out peaceful regions for \n                [his people], to overcome grievous difficulties . . . to promote \n                the welfare of the land . . . to give justice to the oppressed.&#x94;<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote26anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/torahlaw.htm#sdendnote26sym\"><sup>26</sup></a></sup> \n                King Lipit-Ishtar also codified laws to &#x93;establish justice \n                in the land, to turn back enmity . . . to being well-being to \n                the Sumerians and Akkadians . . . &#x93;<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote27anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue4/torahlaw.htm#sdendnote27sym\"><sup>27</sup></a></sup> \n                In the same way, God&#x92;s goals were to have justice and well-being \n                for His nation as well, yet His goals for civil laws ran deeper. \n                His goals were to show the nations, through the Israelite community, \n                who He was and to proclaim His sovereignty, His life-giving ways \n                and His concern for people above all the created world. These \n                laws were a part of a covenant between The Great King and His \n                cherished vassal, Israel. </p>\n              \n              <p>I am personally moved by God&#x92;s \n                desire to have a deeply generous, equitable, protective, truthful \n                society. He wanted the Israelites to experience all of His goodness \n                in the civil laws. In the broken world that we created through \n                our rebellion, God reached down through this nation to give humanity \n                a glimpse of what society could be like through a dependent, trusting, \n                obedient relationship with Him, and this same kind of out-flowing \n                behavior to each other. The civil laws were founded on God&#x92;s \n                view of justice, not on a flawed, selfish human king&#x92;s view, \n                which is tainted with his corrupt culture&#x92;s values and false \n                deities&#x92; capricious demands. I am very grateful that God \n                has placed the highest value on humanity because I know that He \n                values me that much, and His work for me to reach those who do \n                not yet know Him is so significant. As I continuously read Exodus, \n                Leviticus and Deuteronomy, I more deeply trustful of Yahweh. I \n                know He has my best interest at heart because He had the Israelites&#x92; \n                best interest at heart when He gave them His civil laws.

As French must be learned to communicate \n                verbally with Parisians, so one must become sensitized to another \n                culture's values and their corresponding representations if one \n                wishes to comprehend with some degree of accuracy the non&#xA0;verbal \n                signals of another culture. One must adjust to the frequency of \n                the sender if one wishes to receive intelligibly. Symbols constantly \n                acquire new significance through usage, and one unfamiliar with \n                the custom remains an outsider. The problem in understanding or \n                even being aware of such symbols (the domain of semiotics) increases \n                with an individual's conceptual or temporal distance from the \n                sending culture.</p>\n              <p>For \n                the reader of the Old Testament, the problem is particularly acute. \n                Even though one may through translations surmount the language \n                problem of a text originally penned in a non&#xA0;Indo&#xA0;European \n                language, there still remains the formidable obstacles associated \n                with a culture thousands of years old, no longer in existence, \n                whose sole literary<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote3anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote3sym\"><sup>3</sup></a></sup> \n                remains are the biblical text with no human interpreter from that \n                culture to guide our reading.</p>\n              <p>The \n                following discussion is designed to uncover one such symbol of \n                substantial significance in the Old Testament: clothing. By examining \n                reflexes of the relatively stable cultural values expressed by \n                clothes within the Old Testament (with reference as well to the \n                New Testament and traditions elsewhere in the ancient Near East), \n                we hope to make the reading of the biblical text more intelligible \n                to the twentieth century reader for whom clothes and fashion are \n                as changeable as the weather.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote4anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote4sym\"><sup>4</sup></a></sup></p>\n              <p>One \n                may succinctly describe clothing as an extension of the life, \n                personality and vigor of the wearer. Apart from explicit exceptions \n                to be noted below, there is a strict correlation between the condition \n                of one's life and the clothes that are worn.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote5anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote5sym\"><sup>5</sup></a></sup> \n                Clothing often appears as a metaphor for human life in general \n                and an image of a specific individual's life in particular.</p>\n              <p>The \n                frequency with which mourners are bedecked with sackcloth is a \n                ready illustration to introduce this perspective.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote6anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote6sym\"><sup>6</sup></a></sup> \n                Extreme tragedy provoked a change in garments. Normal clothes \n                worn in daily life were inappropriate when normalcy was broken \n                in one's life. The rough, abrasive, uncomfortable and unattractive \n                sackcloth communicated eloquently an inner change in one's psyche. \n                It is obvious that one who wore sackcloth had encountered a crisis \n                for which the sackcloth was the concrete manifestation. But the \n                significance of garments goes far beyond this isolated phenomenon \n                with which most are familiar.</p>\n              <p>Sackcloth \n                apparel was not the only visage of mourning imaged by garments; \n                the destruction of one's own proper garment was an even more intense \n                drama portraying an invisible reality. One might describe the \n                deliberate tearing of one's garment as a formal enactment of the \n                rending of oneself. The sorrow that precipitated such a violent \n                display was often of sufficient intensity to mark the end of one's \n                former life and its continuation (if at all) only in a modified \n                fashion. When an individual becomes hopelessly aware of his or \n                her own imminent death, the tearing of one's clothes is an eloquent \n                metaphor of one's own demise.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote7anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote7sym\"><sup>7</sup></a></sup> \n                The loss or even anticipated loss, of a relative or loved one \n                finds the bereaved rending their garments.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote8anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote8sym\"><sup>8</sup></a></sup> \n                Life had been diminished even for those who continued to live: \n                the rape of Tamar forever changed her life, a boundary by which \n                she marked by the tearing of her garment (2 Sam. 13:19). The leper \n                who is cut off from the community, forced to live apart from society, \n                is to have his clothes torn &#xA0;&#xA0; his life is terminated \n                while he lives (Lev. 13:45).<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote9anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote9sym\"><sup>9</sup></a></sup></p>\n              <p>The \n                point to be emphasized is that not all bad news elicits such extreme \n                responses as the tearing of clothes.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote10anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote10sym\"><sup>10</sup></a></sup> \n                Instead, it is the liminal events and significant boundaries where \n                one's life is dramatically changed.

The wholeness which is \n                required by one who serves in the presence of God must not be \n                diminished, in the same way that those who are mutilated may not \n                serve as priests (Lev. 21:17&#xA0;23). The apparent callousness \n                of this stipulation is explicable from the perspective that the \n                rending of the garments (along with other mourning rites) genuinely \n                represents a deterioration of the life of the officiant.</p>\n              <p>In \n                fact, the position of the priest is made explicit in this regard, \n                for he must wear special clothes if he wishes to enter the temple \n                area.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote16anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote16sym\"><sup>16</sup></a></sup> \n                The elaborate directions for the manufacture and use of the priestly \n                garments in Exodus and Leviticus are another manifestation of \n                the central import of clothes in ritua1.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote17anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote17sym\"><sup>17</sup></a></sup> \n                The dress of the priest is not an optional feature but fraught \n                with considerable significance: in both the Tabernacle legislation \n                and the future Temple service envisaged by Ezekiel, the priests \n                put on special garments when they enter the arena of the holy \n                and they remove these garments when they leave.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote18anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote18sym\"><sup>18</sup></a></sup></p>\n              <p>The \n                garment is thus an objective element by which an individual's \n                vitality and personality is displayed. The destruction or marring \n                of one's garment is consequently a foreboding event which moves \n                in the realm of death. When Jacob sees his son's Joseph's coat \n                covered with blood, he exclaims: \"It is my son's robe; a \n                wild beast has devoured him; Joseph is certainly torn to pieces\" \n                (Gen. 37:33). This is a reasonably logical conclusion on the basis \n                of the evidence, but in a larger framework it is essential that \n                it be precisely Joseph's bloodied garment which is used to represent \n                the misfortune of its former owner.</p>\n              <p>In \n                the same fashion that the destruction of one's clothing marked \n                the end of one's former life, so the renewal of garments identified \n                the wearer as entering into a new .life. When Jacob makes the \n                decisive move to transfer completely his allegiance from traditional \n                gods to Yahweh alone, he orders his extended family to purify \n                themselves and change their clothes (Gen. 35:2). Clothing stands \n                as an extension of one's personality: renewed clothing marks a \n                renewed orientation in life. Perhaps the donning of special clothes \n                to enter the sacred Temple area represents one facet of such a \n                renewal or vivification.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote19anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote19sym\"><sup>19</sup></a></sup></p>\n              <p>Similarly, \n                clothing which does not wear out is a sign of continued vigor \n                under the special protection of providence. The wilderness experience \n                of the Israelites was a forty&#xA0;year miracle of clothes which \n                neither deteriorated nor required replacement, from the clothes \n                on their backs to the shoes on </p>\n              <p>their \n                feet (Deut. 8:4; 29:5; Neh. 9:21). This miracle was another manifestation \n                of the charmed existence of the Israelites in the wilderness, \n                eating manna from heaven and receiving water from the rock.</p>\n              <p>In \n                like manner, the three Jewish men thrown into Nebuchadnezzar's \n                furnace survived the ordeal with no real threat to their lives. \n                The text describes their clothing in detail as they were thrown \n                to their (apparent) doom: \"Then these men were bound in their \n                mantles, their tunics, their hats, and their other garments, and \n                they were cast into the burning fiery furnace\" (Dan 3:21). \n                The interest in detail is curious but significant as the narrator \n                later resumes at the climax: \"The fire had not had any power \n                over the bodies of those men; the hair of their heads was not \n                singed, their mantles were not harmed\" (Dan.3:27).</p>\n              <p>The \n                cultural value which perceives a vigorous life as reflected in \n                continued maintenance of one's clothing became canonized as a \n                legal reality. Exodus 21:10 requires a husband to continue providing \n                the basic necessities to a wife whom he by&#xA0;passes in favor \n                of marrying another. Clothing is one of&#xA0; these three commodities \n                stereotypic throughout the ancient Near East<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote20anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote20sym\"><sup>20</sup></a></sup> \n                which guarantees her continued livelihood.</p>\n              <p>We \n                have seen so far that the mundane banality of clothes may be inadequate \n                to account for their crucial importance at significant junctures \n                in life. This becomes more apparent at the transfer of clothes \n                from one party to another, for it was an act weighted with solemnity \n                of life and death proportions. To give clothes as a gift was one \n                of the most common benefactions of royalty.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote21anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote21sym\"><sup>21</sup></a></sup> \n                But on the non&#xA0;royal plane, it is of central import that \n                Joseph provides his brothers with new garments after he reveals \n                who he is (45:22). Not only is there an irony present, reversing \n                the jealousy once stimulated by the \"coat of many colors;\" \n                but the gift is a sign of new life for the brothers&#xA0;a new \n                life which Joseph wishes to sponsor as a sign of full forgiveness.</p>\n              <p>However, \n                of deeper significance was the transfer to another of clothes \n                which were actually worn by the giver. For example, the influential \n                royal officer Shebna, \"the palace administrator\" <i>('aser \n                'al habbayit Is. </i>22:15), is excoriated by the prophet Isaiah \n                for abuse of his official power. Shebna's doom is eloquently foretold \n                by the prophet, a doom which includes his demise and death in \n                a foreign land. But more precisely for our purposes, his removal \n                from office is described as a divestiture in favor of another \n                person&#x92;s investiture with the same garments (Is. 22:19&#xA0;21):</p>\n              <p>I will thrust you from \n                your office, And you will be cast down from your station. In that \n                day I will call my servant Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, And I \n                will clothe him with your robe, And will bind your girdle on him, \n                And will commit your authority to his hand.</p>\n              <p>It \n                is not accidental that such activity marked the death of the one \n                deprived of clothes, or at least pointed to his demise or termination \n                of his effectiveness. When the story of Aaron's death is told, \n                we find Moses following God's directive (Num. 20:25&#xA0;28):</p>\n              <p>Take \n                Aaron and his son Eleazar, and bring them up to Mount Hor; and \n                strip Aaron of his garments and put them on his son Eleazar. So \n                Aaron will be gathered to his people and will die there . . . \n                And after Moses had stripped Aaron of his garments and put them \n                on his son Eleazar, Aaron died there on the mountain top.</p>\n              <p>The \n                transfer of the clothes immediately prior to death is not coincidental, \n                for the text wishes to underscore the real connection in an unbroken \n                sequence of the spiritual unity between the first priest and his \n                successor. The bond is achieved through the transfer of the former \n                person&#x92;s clothes.</p>\n              <p>This \n                deliberate orientation reappears at the death of the great prophet \n                Elijah. His successor Elisha's initial response is to tear his \n                own clothes when Elijah is taken away forever (2 Kgs. 2:12). But \n                the torn clothes do not mark the final statement of Elisha's condition, \n                for he next picks up his former master's mantle by which he is \n                invigorated to accomplish precisely the same miracles which his \n                master had performed before his death. As Elijah had split the \n                Jordan (2 Kgs. 2:8), so the new bearer of the mantle can do precisely \n                the same (v.14). The continuity between the deceased and his successor \n                is marked by the transfer of the former person&#x92;s garment.</p>\n              <p>In \n                addition to the transfer of authority just noted in the prophetic \n                and priestly offices, even the kingship privilege was marked by \n                the transfer of the royal garments. King Saul had already clothed \n                David in his own garments and armor at a time when Saul was ineffective \n                in leading the people (1 Sam. 18:38). Although David declines \n                the offer as inadequate, this unwitting transfer of the royal \n                wardrobe to the future king is affirmed as more than fortuitous \n                when Saul's own heir, the crown&#xA0;prince Jonathan, also gives \n                his own clothes to David (1 Sam 18:4). These actions adumbrate \n                the eventual death of Saul and Jonathan, in whose place David \n                assumes the kingship.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote22anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote22sym\"><sup>22</sup></a></sup></p>\n              <p>It \n                was also possible to share one's garment with another while still \n                wearing it or at least maintaining possession. The inertia of \n                the concept above would imply that a shared garment signifies \n                the assimilation of the newly clothed party into the life of the \n                one who shares the garment. Thus, in some betrothal contexts, \n                the man is described as spreading his garment over his future \n                wife. Ruth asks Boaz to do this to her (Ruth 3:9), and God describes \n                himself as spreading his garment over Israel when she became his \n                bride (Ezk. 16:8). It is not simply that \"covering a woman \n                with one's mantle signified the intention of acting as her protector,\"<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote23anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote23sym\"><sup>23</sup></a></sup> \n                but on a more fundamental level the life of the woman is now becoming \n                joined to the life of the man, or in the words of Genesis 2:24, \n                they become \"one flesh:\"</p>\n              <p>Since \n                the garment was clearly an extension of one's life and personality, \n                certain symbolic gestures gain clarity when seen from this vantage \n                point. The acknowledgment of a new Israelite king was partially \n                achieved, on at least one occasion, by individuals removing their \n                garments and placing them at the king's feet. Clearly a symbol \n                of submission, the garments in this context are a part which represents \n                the whole of the person whose garment lies beneath the king. The \n                repetition of this action in the case of Christ's entry into Jerusalem \n                is no doubt embroidered with royal connotations (Mk. 11:8; Lk. \n                19:36), but the royal ritual must be seen as a part of a much \n                larger dimension in which a garment is perceived as an extension \n                of the wearer's life.</p>\n              <p>Another \n                symbolic gesture appears in relation to the tearing of garments \n                discussed earlier. Saul attempts to humbly petition an angry Samuel \n                by grasping the hem of Samuel's garment.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote24anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote24sym\"><sup>24</sup></a></sup> \n                But when the cloth accidentally tears in Saul's hands, Samuel \n                sees the action as pointing to a violent rending in the perpetrator's \n                (Saul's) own life: the kingdom will be torn out of his hand and \n                given to another (1 Sam. 15:27-28). The tearing of a garment with \n                this same significance reappears later when Solomon's kingdom \n                is fractured (1 Kgs. 11:29-31).</p>\n              <p>The \n                potency of the garment as a legitimate extension of the wearer \n                is the driving element in the minds of many of those who seek \n                to be healed by Jesus and his disciples. The woman who had been \n                sick for twelve years articulates the dynamic precisely: \"If \n                I can just touch his clothes, I shall be saved\" (Mk. 5:28). \n                This narrative is crucial, for not only is she immediately cured, \n                but the event elicits a response from Jesus. As Mark observes \n                (5:30):<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote25anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote25sym\"><sup>25</sup></a></sup></p>\n              <p>And at once aware of \n                the power that had gone out from him, Jesus turned around in the \n                crowd and said, 'Who touched my clothes?'</p>\n              <p>The \n                identity between clothes and wearer can be no more intimately \n                presented, for the cloth is a vehicle and channel for expressing \n                the vitality and life of the person. This woman's wish is not \n                unique, for wherever Jesus went, \"they laid down the sick \n                in the open spaces, begging him to lei them touch even the fringe \n                of his cloak\" (Mk.6:56). It is consequently not surprising \n                to find that those who follow it Jesus' footsteps are able to \n                heal individuals by simply touching garments which are then taken \n                to the ill as an extension of the personal power of the apostle \n                (Acts 19:12).</p>\n              <p>On \n                another level, garments were a reflection of a person's position \n                or status in the community.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote26anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote26sym\"><sup>26</sup></a></sup> \n                Among the more obvious examples are the luxuriously splendid clothes \n                of those either of royal status or specially privileged by royalty. \n                Mordechai left the presence of the king bedecked in \"royal \n                robes of blue and white with a large crown of gold and a garment \n                of fine linen and purple\" (Est. 9:15). Daniel is elevated \n                to position as third ruler in Babylon, clothed with purple and \n                a necklace of gold (Dan. 5:26). When Joseph is elevated over all \n                Egypt, Pharaoh bestows upon him garments of fine linen with a \n                gold necklace (Gen. 41:42). The assumption in these stories is \n                that clothing is a reliable indicator of status.</p>\n              <p>But \n                it is not just the upper class who can be identified by their \n                clothes. We are specifically told of a special garment worn by \n                virgins in Israel (2 Sam. 13:18). Widows wore a distinctive garb \n                according to Genesis 38:14, 19, and a harlot could be identified \n                by what she wore (Pr. 7:10). Jesus related a parable whose climax \n                depended upon distinctive garments which one should wear to a \n                wedding (Mt. 22:11&#xA0;12). The special garment which Jacob gave \n                to Joseph alone among all his brothers certainly communicated \n                a message that this son was uniquely special to his father, for \n                it showed to them that \"their father loved him more than \n                all his brothers\" (Gen. 37:4). The attire of a prophet was \n                apparently distinctive with its hairy exterior and leather belt \n                (Zech. 13:4; 2 Kgs. 1:8; Mt. 3:4; Mk. 1:6), a type of clothing \n                which Jesus underscored as certainly not characteristic of a refined \n                life&#xA0;style: \"A man wearing fine clothes? Look, those \n                who wear fine clothes are to be found in palaces\" (Mt. 11:8&#xA0;9). \n                Clothes, therefore, could be unambiguous symbols of identification \n                of status, social position, and relationship.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote27anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote27sym\"><sup>27</sup></a></sup></p>\n              <p>It \n                is appropriate that clothing should reflect the life of its wearer, \n                for biblical texts repeatedly employ imagery which stresses the \n                \"mortality\" of garments. In fact, the mortality of mankind \n                is compared to the parallel shortcoming in garments: \"Man \n                crumbles away like rotten wood, or like a moth&#xA0;eaten garment\" \n                (Job 13:28). Garments are characteristically short-lived so that \n                even the inevitable dissolution of the cosmos itself is honed \n                to a comprehensible, narrow focus where it is compared to clothing \n                which grows old or is vulnerable to voracious moths (Ps. 102:26; \n                Is. 50:9; 51:6, 8).</p>\n              <p>It \n                is easy to overstate the correlation between the clothes on the \n                exterior and the real person whom they represent. Biblical imagery \n                is equally emphatic that a second trajectory is also present which \n                depicts the garment as a deceptive facade which misleads the onlooker. \n                Examples already cited above align themselves in this direction, \n                such as Joseph's blood&#xA0;stained coat presented to Jacob. Joseph \n                is not really dead, and although the coat presented to Jacob is \n                an accurate symbol of what amounts to Joseph's living death as \n                a slave in a foreign land, his father is deceived as to Joseph's \n                true condition. The deception is not inappropriate in this case \n                and is a fitting act of poetic justice, for Jacob had earlier \n                deceived his father by donning his brother's clothes and pretending \n                to be Esau (Gen. 27:1&#xA0;45). In like manner, Judah, who had \n                assisted in passing off the bloodied cloak, was deceived by Tamar's \n                deliberate disguise as a cultic prostitute (Gen. 38:1&#xA0;26).</p>\n              <p>Therefore, \n                Christ's dictum that false prophets are wolves in the guise of \n                sheep (Mt. 7:15) is not without precedent, Joshua was fooled by \n                the crafty Gibeonites who displayed their tattered clothes as \n                \"proof\" of the great distance which they had traveled \n                (Jos. 9:5,13). King Ahab was tricked by a prophet who disguised \n                himself (1 Kgs. 20:37&#xA0;42). And the early church succumbed \n                to the easy but false intuition that there is a true correlation \n                between one's clothes and one's spiritual status (James 2:2&#xA0;4).</p>\n              <p>Now \n                suppose a man comes into your assembly, well&#xA0;dressed and \n                with a gold ring on and at the same time a poor man comes in, \n                in shabby clothes, and you take notice of the well&#xA0;dressed \n                man, and say, \"Come this way to the best seats\"; then \n                you tell the poor man, \"Stand over there\" or \"You \n                can sit on the floor by my footrest\" In making this distinction \n                among yourselves have you not used a corrupt standard?</p>\n              <p>It \n                is not true that there is always a necessary correlation between \n                the outer garment and the inner personality. When Joel cries out, \n                \"Rend your heart and not your garments\" (2:13), he is \n                already affirming a universal human condition, as common as the \n                lying tongue.</p>\n              <p>In \n                fact, one could argue that there is sufficient semantic overlap \n                between the notion of \"covering\" oneself with a garment \n                and \"covering up\" something which one wishes to hide, \n                an overlap which may account for the very vocabulary of clothing \n                itself:</p>\n              <p>The connection between \n                the ideas \"cover, clothe, besmear, cover with paint or other \n                material\" on the one hand, and \"deceive, mislead\", \n                etc. on the other hand is very frequent.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote28anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote28sym\"><sup>28</sup></a></sup></p>\n              <p>What \n                is it that clothes are designed to cover up? The testimony of \n                the Bible is unanimous that man's natural condition of nakedness \n                is a legitimate cause for shame. God certainly does not wish to \n                see men's nakedness when they serve in the sacrificial ritual \n                (Ex. 28:42&#xA0;43), and precautions are taken to insure that \n                no accidental exposure occurs: steps are not allowed at God's \n                altar lest the raising of the leg accidentally lift one's garment \n                (Ex. 20:26).</p>\n              <p>There \n                is an awareness that this shame results from a former breach between \n                God and man, for there once was a time when man walked naked in \n                God's presence with no opprobrium, indeed, no self&#xA0;consciousness \n                that he was naked (Gen. 2:25; 3:8&#xA0;11). Not only does God \n                provide cultic measures to minimize exposure of nakedness in the \n                sacrificial service as noted above, but God himself affirmed that \n                covering one's nakedness with clothes was a legitimate means of \n                solving the immediate problem of shame. Although Adam and Eve \n                initially sewed fig leaves together (Gen. 3:7), it was God who \n                designed the first substantial garments for humankind out of animal \n                skins (Gen. 3:21). Clothing thus is a bivalent symbol in this \n                regard, affirming simultaneously both the tragedy of man as an \n                incongruous rebel in creation and also his nobility as one whose \n                shame is found worthy of resolution by the very hand of God himself. \n                Indeed, God's gift of clothes to man and woman is an affirmation \n                of hope that God can yet bring life where death holds sway.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote29anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote29sym\"><sup>29</sup></a></sup></p>\n              <p>The \n                identification of nakedness with shame is integrated with notions \n                of death, reinforcing our observations that clothing represents \n                an extension of the life of the wearer. It is precisely the naked \n                who are on the verge of death if not already dead. Most obviously, \n                one often finds that those without clothes are also lacking in \n                nourishment (e.g. James 2:15). But in addition, before execution \n                one is stripped naked (Hos. 2:5; Ezk. 16:39&#xA0;40; cf.; Ezk. \n                23:26; Is. 47:2&#xA0;3; Nah. 3:5&#xA0;7). When Job's calamities \n                burst over his head, he first tears his robe and then the words \n                which leave his mouth provide the classic commentary: \"Naked \n                I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return\" (Job. \n                1:20&#xA0;21).<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote30anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote30sym\"><sup>30</sup></a></sup></p>\n              <p>The \n                one who is naked is the one who is aware of his imminent mortality. \n                It is the one without clothes who is vulnerable and in danger \n                of perishing (Job 24:7, 10; 31:19). It is later fitting that the \n                insane man dwells among the tombs without clothing (Lk. 8:27), \n                but when healed by Jesus, he is found in his right mind and clothed, \n                sitting at the feet of Jesus (Lk. 8:35).<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote31anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote31sym\"><sup>31</sup></a></sup> \n                It is also appropriate that man's mortality in the Garden of Eden \n                is signaled by a dawning awareness of his nakedness.</p>\n              <p>Therefore, \n                the laws in the Pentateuch which limit certain exchanges of clothing \n                should not be perceived as an isolated phenomenon. One is not \n                allowed to take a widow's garment as a pledge for payment of a \n                debt according to Deuteronomy 24:17, while Exodus 22:20&#xA0;26 \n                requires that any garments taken as pledges from the poor must \n                be returned before sunset. That the issue is of life and death \n                proportions is evident from the fact that abusing this stipulation \n                moves God to personally deal with the offender (v. 27):</p>\n              <p>It is all the covering \n                he has; it is the cloak he wraps his body in; what else will he \n                sleep in?

It is a world where spirits were \n                birds descending from heaven, where the voice of God was heard \n                in the thunder, where the winds were God's servants and his angels \n                stars. It is part of this intimate integration of the physical \n                and the spiritual realm, the abstract and the concrete, that common \n                clothing was not so common after all. A man's garment was his \n                life or at least an extension of it - representing his status, \n                condition, position, personality, vulnerability. From sackcloth \n                to splendid purple, from a widow's garb to the royal cloth, from \n                a prophet's hairy attire to the sacred priestly clothes, from \n                the torn garment to the gift of new clothes &#xA0; the diversity \n                of representations allowed for the fruitful development of the \n                bond between a person and the clothes which he or she wore.

Advice to others who descend to the underworld \n                  includes not putting on clean clothes nor wearing sandals lest \n                  the underworld inhabitants easily identify the intruder as an \n                  alien (Gilgamesh XII. 14&#xA0;15, 22, 33&#xA0;34, 40 originally \n                  a Sumerian tradition see A.

According to passages such as Deut. 10:18 \n                  (and even Gen. 3:21 as described above), one is simply following \n                  the divine example; note the parallelism in the late Assyrian \n                  hymn: \"Who covers shame with clothes, who gives life to \n                  god and man\" (E. Ebeling, \"Ein Loblied auf Gula&#xA0;Baba \n                  aus neuassyrischer Zeit;\" <i>Or </i>23 [1954] 346, 348 \n                  1.13). The case of Dorcas in the New Testament is particularly \n                  instructive, for though she died, it is the clothes which she \n                  made for others which is the single concrete feature of significance \n                  which precedes her being raised from he dead (Acts 9:39-40).</p>\n              </div>\n              <div id=\"sdendnote33\">\n                <p class=\"sdendnote\"><a class=\"sdendnotesym\" name=\"sdendnote33sym\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm#sdendnote33anc\">33</a> \n                  One finds that the description of the garment as seamless is \n                  often interpreted as a reflection of the high priest's garment \n                  made in similar fashion (e.g. New Jerusalem Bible p. 1787 n.i. \n                  ). But this does not explain why John insists that it was not \n                  torn.</p>\n              </div>\n              \n            </td>\n          </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Let Your Garments Always Be White - by Sam Meier","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/garments.htm"}

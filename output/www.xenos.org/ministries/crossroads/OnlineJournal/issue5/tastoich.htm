In each of these non&#xA0;Pauline examples, \n                s<i>toicheion is </i>used in one of its classical meanings. In \n                2 Pet. 3, it clearly refers to the physical elements of the universe \n                that will be destroyed by the Lord at the end of the age.

(Gal. 3:3,9,10)<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote7anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/tastoich.htm#sdendnote7sym\"><sup>7</sup></a></sup></p>\n              <p>Paul \n                uses the phrase \"of the world\" (tou kosmou) to describe \n                \"the elementary principles\" in three of his four uses \n                of <i>ta stoicheia</i>. It is obvious that Paul is using the phrase \n                \"of the world\" in a negative sense. In the remaining \n                usage of \"the elementary principles\" (Gal. 4:9), Paul \n                clearly intends the same negative meaning as the other three because \n                he describes them with the phrase \"weak and worthless.\"</p>\n              <p>In \n                both letters, Paul is refuting false teachings that have infiltrated \n                the churches. It seems evident that the Colossian heresy was some \n                sort of Greek-Jewish synthesis, perhaps a form of proto-gnosticism. \n                The Galatian heresy appears to be a form of traditional Palestinian \n                Judaism which insists that the Galatian Christians also take on \n                the Old Testament law as a requisite for salvation. It is the \n                view of this author that its advocates were the \"Judaizer\" \n                party of the Jerusalem church which was later denounced by the \n                Jerusalem Council recorded in Acts 15.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote8anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/tastoich.htm#sdendnote8sym\"><sup>8</sup></a></sup> \n                In both cases, Old Testament practices are being prescribed in \n                a way which undercuts the full sufficiency of Jesus' work on the \n                cross, thus calling forth some of Paul's clearest written teaching \n                on the subject of the finished work of Christ (Col.2:10-15; Gal.2:16-21).</p>\n              <p><a name=\"TheThreeClassicalInterpretations\"><b>The \n                Three Classical Interpretations</b></a></p>\n              <p>Three \n                classical interpretations of \"the elementary principles of \n                the world\" have been formulated, though each interpretation \n                has a number of variations. The following is a summary of those \n                interpretations, their leading advocates, and the main support \n                and problems for each view.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote9anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/tastoich.htm#sdendnote9sym\"><sup>9</sup></a></sup></p>\n              <p><a name=\"TheLawofIsrael\"><i>The \n                Law of Israel</i></a></p>\n              <p>The \n                first view holds that Paul is referring to the Law of Israel. \n                This view, which is advocated by Lightfoot, Stott and Tenney among \n                others, stresses the way in which Paul connects being \"under \n                the Law\" in Gal. 3:23, 4:5 with being \"under the elementary \n                principles of the world\" in Gal. 4:3. It also cites the fact \n                that in each case, the heretics are prescribing Old Testament \n                laws (see Col. 2:16,21; Gal. 4:10). </p>\n              <p>Certainly \n                there is a connection between these two concepts, but it is overstating \n                the case to call them synonymous for at least two reasons. First, \n                it seems unlikely for Paul to call \"the world\" the origin \n                of the Law of Israel. In Gal.3:19&#xA0;23, Paul teaches that God \n                gave the Law to keep Israel under custody until the coming of \n                the Messiah. Whatever this may mean, it certainly affirms the \n                divine origin of the Law and its essential righteousness.</p>\n              <p>The \n                biggest problem with this interpretation is that it does not account \n                for the fact that in both passages, Paul also uses this phrase \n                to refer to Gentile and/or heretical teachings. In Col. 2:8, Paul \n                refers to \"philosophy and empty deception, according to the \n                tradition of men, according to `the elementary principles of the \n                world,' rather than according to Christ.\" This passage makes \n                it clear that the phrase refers to something originating from \n                the sphere of man rather than from Christ. In Gal. 4:9, Paul says \n                that the Galatians are in danger of returning <i>again</i> to \n                the stoi<i>cheia, </i>when their <i>first</i> involvement with \n                them was pagan idolatry (vs. 8). Therefore, this interpretation \n                is inadequate as a full explanation of the phrase.</p>\n              <p><a name=\"TheDemonicSpirits\"><i>The \n                Demonic Spirits</i></a></p>\n              <p>Most \n                scholars argue that Paul is referring to the satanic demons that \n                have originated the false teachings that Paul is refuting. Paul \n                calls them \"the elementary principles of the world\" \n                because the heretics were referring to them as the spirit&#xA0;beings \n                that rule over the heavens. Far from being a superior revelation \n                from God that will bring them spiritual liberation, Paul ironically \n                implies that this teaching originates from demons and will therefore \n                only bring them into bondage. Among the scholars who hold this \n                view are Boice,<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote10anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/tastoich.htm#sdendnote10sym\"><sup>10</sup></a></sup> \n                F. F. Bruce, Vaughn, Guthrie and Carson.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote11anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/tastoich.htm#sdendnote11sym\"><sup>11</sup></a></sup></p>\n              <p>Support \n                for this interpretation is found from a number of sources. The \n                fact most cited by the above authors is that \"the elementary \n                principles\" is used in extra&#xA0;biblical literature to \n                refer to the stellar spirits that were identified with the heavenly \n                bodies.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote12anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/tastoich.htm#sdendnote12sym\"><sup>12</sup></a></sup> \n                Both passages also make reference to angels in some relationship \n                to the phrase. In Gal. 3:19, Paul refers to angels as the mediators \n                through which God gave the Law. In Gal. 4:8, he speaks of \"those \n                which are by nature no gods\" which the Galatians formerly \n                worshiped, and then seemingly applies \"the elementary principles\" \n                to them in vs. 9. In Col. 2:18, Paul speaks of \"the worship \n                of angels\" as part of the heresy associated with the \"the \n                elementary principles.\"</p>\n              <p>There \n                are, however, several problems with this view. The most formidable \n                problem is that Paul's usage of \"the elementary principles\" \n                definitely includes the Law of Israel (see above). It is very \n                difficult to see how the worship of stellar spirits could be construed \n                by Paul to be a part of Old Testament Law when it specifically \n                prohibits such worship (see Ex. 20:3&#xA0;5). The references to \n                dietary laws (Col. 2:16) and calendar observances (Gal. 4:10) \n                are obviously Old Testament, but many of those who hold this view \n                try unsuccessfully to prove that they are actually Greek practices.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote13anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/tastoich.htm#sdendnote13sym\"><sup>13</sup></a></sup> \n                This is a serious weakness of the view, especially for the Galatians \n                passage, because it is impossible that the Judaizers were prescribing \n                astrological observances.</p>\n              <p>Delling \n                deals what seems to be a lethal blow to this view. He claims that \n                <i>stoicheion </i>was not used to refer to spiritual beings prior \n                to the fourth century A.D.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote14anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/tastoich.htm#sdendnote14sym\"><sup>14</sup></a></sup> \n                Ladd states that the word was not applied to the astral deities \n                until the third century A.D.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote15anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/tastoich.htm#sdendnote15sym\"><sup>15</sup></a></sup> \n                If this is the case, this interpretation must be seriously questioned \n                because it depends upon a meaning for \"the elementary principles\" \n                which did not come into use until much later.</p>\n              <p><a name=\"ReligiousPrinciples\"><i>Religious \n                Principles</i></a></p>\n              <p>Ridderbos, \n                Ladd, Brown, Longenecker, Rendall and Delling<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote16anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/tastoich.htm#sdendnote16sym\"><sup>16</sup></a></sup> \n                interpret \"the elementary principles of the world\" to \n                refer to religion before and apart from Christ. Understanding \n                \"the elementary principles\" in the sense of \"rudimentary \n                principles;' it sees Paul contrasting all religions in a negative \n                light compared to the way to God opened by Jesus Christ. Christ \n                has now replaced even Old Testament Judaism, which once had a \n                limited validity. To return to it is to return to a state of inferior \n                spiritual status similar in some way to that of pagan idolatry.</p>\n              <p>This \n                interpretation has the advantage of being able to apply to both \n                Old Testament Judaism and the Gentile religions and philosophies, \n                a major problem with the two previous interpretations. It also \n                explains why even the Law is cast in a negative light. Apart from \n                the work of Christ which it foreshadowed, it too can lead only \n                to slavery (see Gal. 3:22,23). Now that Christ has come, it is \n                only a \"weak and worthless\" system (Gal. 4:9), a mere \n                shadow (Col. 2:17) that should be discarded.</p>\n              <p>This \n                view, however, is not without problems. The biggest problem is \n                that it makes Paul designate even the Old Testament Law as \"of \n                the world\" (Gal. 4:3). He likewise seems to say in Col. 2:8 \n                that the \"the elementary principles of the world\" are \n                synonymous with \"the traditions of men:\" This runs counter \n                to the divine origin of the Law. There are two different ways \n                in which scholars deal with this problem.</p>\n              <p><a name=\"ThePerversionoftheLaw\"><i>The \n                Perversion </i>of <i>the Law</i></a></p>\n              <p>Ridderbos \n                and Ladd contend that Paul is speaking of the <i>perverse on </i>of \n                the Old Testament Law into a legalistic, humanistic system of \n                justification and sanctification. These scholars point out that \n                both the Colossian heresy and the Judaizers in Galatia were in \n                fact perverting the Law into such a system. This would account \n                for Paul's designation of it as \"according to the traditions \n                of men\" and \"of the world.\" Though God originated \n                the Law, its misuse originates from the world of fallen man. This \n                view would also make sense of Paul's description of all these \n                systems as \"weak and worthless\" (Gal. 4:9).</p>\n              <p>The \n                major problem with this view is that it does not deal adequately \n                with the language and context of Gal. 4:3&#xA0;5. Here Paul teaches \n                that he, other Jews and Jesus Himself were all \"under the \n                Law\" and \"under the elementary principles of the world\" \n                (he uses the terms interchangeably). While it may be argued that \n                Paul and other Jews were under a legalistic perversion of the \n                Law, the same <i>cannot</i> be claimed for Jesus. He definitely \n                rejected the Rabbinic interpretation of the Law as a means of \n                righteousness and refused to live under it in that way. Furthermore, \n                the context of Gal.3:19&#xA0;23 uses the phrase \"under the \n                Law\" in the sense that it was accomplishing God's intended \n                purpose in shutting up all men under sin and thus preparing them \n                for their Savior&#xA0;Messiah Jesus. In this author's opinion, \n                these two problems render this view improbable.</p>\n              <p><a name=\"TheOutdatedLaw\"><i>The \n                Outdated Law</i></a></p>\n              <p>Brown, \n                Delling, Longenecker and Rendall insist that in addition to human \n                philosophies and religions, Paul is referring to the Old Testament \n                Law in its proper sense. The Law was valid because it foreshadowed \n                the work of Christ and made people aware of their need for forgiveness, \n                but it is now no longer valid because the New Covenant for which \n                it made preparation has now come.</p>\n              <p>This \n                view has several advantages. It clearly allows for the Jewish \n                meaning of the prescriptions of Col. 2:16,21 and Gal. 4:10. It \n                allows for the obvious sense of the phrase \"under the Law\" \n                in Gal. 3:19&#xA0;4:5. It explains why Paul can refer even to \n                the Law as \"weak and worthless\" because, as Heb.7:18,19 \n                says, \" . . . there is the setting aside of the former commandment \n                because of its weakness and uselessness (for the Law made nothing \n                perfect) . . . '</p>\n              <p>This \n                view also explains why Paul can link the Law with human religions. \n                What validity the Old Testament Law once had is now gone since \n                its fulfillment has come. To go back to a impersonal religious \n                system after a personal relationship with God is now possible \n                through the indwelling Holy Spirit is to go back to a state no \n                better (in that sense) than paganism (Gal. 4:6&#xA0;11). While \n                Paul stops short of calling the Law \"false\" in the same \n                sense as pagan religions, he insists that going under it as a \n                Christian is a reversion as serious as relapse into idolatry (Gal. \n                4:8&#xA0;10).</p>\n              <p>The \n                major problem with this view is the origin that Paul ascribes \n                to these \"elementary principles:\" In Col. 2:8, he appears \n                to use the phrase \"the traditions of men\" synonymously \n                with \"the elementary principles of the world.\" The same \n                problem exists with the phrase \"of the world.\" While \n                a fitting description for pagan religions, both phrases imply \n                a human origin for the Law, even though Paul says elsewhere that \n                it originates from God.</p>\n              <p>However, \n                these problems can be resolved if one realizes that in both passages, \n                Paul has especially the ritual laws of Old Testament Judaism in \n                view. Since these laws do not relate directly to spiritual realities \n                and had only a temporary, foreshadowing function, they could be \n                called \"of the world\" in the sense they pertain only \n                to this world.<sup><a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" name=\"sdendnote17anc\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/tastoich.htm#sdendnote17sym\"><sup>17</sup></a></sup> \n                \"World\" is being used, as Ladd suggests, as \" . \n                . . the whole complex of human earthly relationships . . .

Paul completely denies the \n                legitimacy of such commands (Col. 2:16) and rejects the description \n                of it as \"spirituality\" because it has no power over \n                the flesh (Col. 2:23). This author is convinced that a proper \n                application of these passages would insist on an eradication of \n                such practices from the church.</p>\n              <p><a name=\"NewTestamentRitualism\"><i>New \n                Testament Ritualism</i></a></p>\n              <p>These \n                two passages also warn in principle against the danger of ritualism \n                even when the New Testament can justify the rituals involved. \n                \"Ritualism\" is being used here in the sense of making \n                ritual observance a primary focus of the Christian life and means \n                of its expression. Water baptism and communion are the two rituals \n                most often employed in such \"New Testament\" ritualism, \n                although footwashing and other practices are sometimes also included.</p>\n              <p>The \n                Galatian passage in particular, pits the religion of ritual observance \n                against the great privilege of personally relating to God through \n                the agency of the Holy Spirit. Ritualism was legitimate during \n                the Old Testament economy <i>because </i>this kind of personal \n                relationship with God was not possible. But <i>now</i> God has \n                made it possible to relate to Him <i>as Abba. </i>The work of \n                Christ and the gift of the Holy Spirit have made it possible for \n                us to be adopted into God's family. To go back to relating to \n                God primarily through ritual observance is to reject God's assessment \n                of this gift. This is spiritual regression that is reprehensible \n                enough to make Paul fear that he had labored in vain (vs. 11)!</p>\n              <p>While \n                the New Testament rituals remain a legitimate aspect of Christianity, \n                ritualism as the means of relating to God has been \"outgrown\" \n                and rejected. This is also the argument of the book of Hebrews \n                (especially chapters 7-10). No church that focuses on ritualism \n                can claim to be a valid representation of Pauline Christianity.</p>\n              <p>It \n                is important to note that Jesus prescribed very few rituals compared \n                to the number in the Old Testament economy. It is also noteworthy \n                that the way in which these rituals are to be observed is not \n                explained in detail, again a sharp contrast to the Old Testament \n                period. Since we live in the period of fulfillment of salvation \n                rather than in the period of promise, ritual takes on a lesser \n                role. This fact, together with Paul's warning in Ga1.4:1&#xA0;11, \n                should teach the believer that ritual plays a relatively minor \n                role in the Christian life compared to his/her personal relationship \n                with Christ.</p>\n              <p><a name=\"NOTES\"><strong>NOTES</strong></a></p>\n              <div id=\"sdendnote1\">\n                <p class=\"sdendnote\"><a class=\"sdendnotesym\" name=\"sdendnote1sym\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/tastoich.htm#sdendnote1anc\">1</a> \n                  Colin Brown, ed. <i>The New International Dictionary of New \n                  Testament Theology </i>(Grand Rapids: Zondervan Publishing House, \n                  1976), Vol. <i>2, p. 452.</i></p>\n              </div>\n              <div id=\"sdendnote2\">\n                <p class=\"sdendnote\"><a class=\"sdendnotesym\" name=\"sdendnote2sym\" href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue5/tastoich.htm#sdendnote2anc\">2</a> \n                  Acts <i>21:24 &#xA0; James </i>wants Paul to take a Nazarite \n                  vow, thus showing the Jews that he \"walks orderly <i>(stoicheis), \n                  </i>keeping the Law. . :\" Phil. 3:16 &#xA0; Paul urges \n                  the Philippian Christians to \"keep living to that standard \n                  <i>(stoicheion) </i>to which we have attained:\" Gal. 6:16 \n                  &#xA0; Referring to the new creation, Paul says, \"To those \n                  who walk by <i>(stoichesousin) </i>this rule, peace and mercy \n                  be upon them. . :' Gal. <i>5:25 &#xA0; \"If </i>we live \n                  by the Spirit, let us also walk by <i>(stoichomen) </i>the Spirit\" \n                  Rom. <i>4:12 &#xA0; Specifying </i>to whom the promise was given, \n                  Paul says, \". . . those who follow in the steps <i>(stoichousin) \n                  </i>of the faith of Abraham. . .\" Delling is careful to \n                  point out that <i>stoicheo is </i>not used synonymously with \n                  the other verbs meaning \"to walk;\" but rather retains \n                  the stricter meaning of \"to be closely regulated by.\" \n                  See Gerhard, Friedrich, ed. <i>Theological Dictionary of the \n                  New Testament.

Likewise, in view of \n                  the historical background of Galatians, the phrase \"days \n                  and months and seasons and years\" is an obvious reference \n                  to Old Testament ritual law.

Bible \n              names, however, have their background in the widespread tradition \n              that personal names give information, describing in some way who \n              people are.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref2\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue2/nmsofgod.htm#Note2\">[2]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n              To explain and give one's name was to reveal the central aspect \n              of one's personality and character. Consider the following examples: \n              </p>\n            <p>1. <b>1 Sam. 25:23-25</b>, the name \n              of Nabal is equated with his existence, character and reputation: \n              </p>\n            <blockquote> \n              <p>23 When Abigail saw David, she hurried \n                and dismounted from her donkey, and fell on her face before David \n                and bowed herself to the ground. 24 She fell at his feet and said, \n                \"On me alone, my lord, be the blame.

Names used for the devil are descriptive \n              of his character, personality and deeds. The personal name, <i>Satan</i>, \n              means <i>adversary, opposer</i>, and was consistently used by the \n              Hebrews to refer to the devil.<sup><a name=\"Ref3\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue2/nmsofgod.htm#Note3\">[3]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n              </p>\n            <p>4. Names like <i>Esau</i> (which means, \n              <i>red</i>), and <i>Laban</i> (which means, <i>blond</i>), were \n              descriptive of physical appearance. </p>\n            <p>5. Scripture reveals God as a God who \n              placed special significance on names. His vision for <i>Abraham</i> \n              is evident in renaming him from <i>Abram</i>, in <b>Genesis 17:4,5</b>: \n              </p>\n            <blockquote> \n              <p>4 \"As for Me, behold, My covenant \n                is with you, And you will be the father of a multitude of nations. \n                5 \"No longer shall your name be called Abram, But your name \n                shall be Abraham; For I will make you the father of a multitude \n                of nations. </p>\n            </blockquote>\n            <p><i>Abram</i> means, <i>exalted father</i>, \n              while <i>Abraham</i> means, <i>father of a multitude</i>. </p>\n            <p>6. Likewise, <i>Jacob</i>, is renamed, \n              <i>Israel,</i> in <b>Genesis 35:9,10</b>. </p>\n            <blockquote> \n              <p>9 Then God appeared to Jacob again \n                when he came from Paddan-aram, and He blessed him. 10God said \n                to him, \"Your name is Jacob; You shall no longer be called \n                Jacob, But Israel shall be your name.\" Thus He called him \n                Israel. 11God also said to him, \"I am God Almighty; Be fruitful \n                and multiply; A nation and a company of nations shall come from \n                you, And kings shall come forth from you. </p>\n            </blockquote>\n            <p>The name, <i>Jacob</i>, means <i>cheat, \n              supplanter</i>, while the name, <i>Israel</i>, means <i>prince with \n              God. </i></p>\n            <p>The names that we read in our English \n              Bibles, <i>God</i> and <i>Lord</i>, reveal little to us in terms \n              of God's character, nature and personality. Much of the understanding \n              is lost in the translation, and, if we are to understand their fullness, \n              we must understand them in their original language. There are many \n              names used for God in Scripture.<sup><a name=\"Ref4\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue2/nmsofgod.htm#Note4\">[4]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n              The great difficulty arises in the ability to describe an infinite \n              Being, in finite terms. Nathan Stone makes the point in his book, \n              <i>Names of God</i>, that one needs many words to describe the character \n              and personality of human beings like Moses and David, let alone \n              the Supreme God of the Universe! No <i>one</i> name, he suggests, \n              is sufficient to accomplish this purpose.<sup><a name=\"Ref5\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue2/nmsofgod.htm#Note5\">[5]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n              </p>\n            <p>We will look at the most prevalent \n              and some of the rarer names used by the biblical authors. One thing \n              we must keep in mind is that Scripture is the revelation of God \n              to man. As such, the ultimate authority and control of these names \n              as they are used, is God's. The individual authors may have had \n              a unique purpose and contribution, or preference, but that purpose \n              must ultimately be attributed to God (2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:20,21). \n              The biblical author viewed the events he recorded as unique, historical \n              events in which a speaking and acting God revealed His will to, \n              and through mankind. \"These events were the initial patterns \n              for all subsequent encounters of God with men. They were not simply \n              events, but they were unique events.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref6\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue2/nmsofgod.htm#Note6\">[6]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n              </p>\n            <p>Walter Kaiser, in his incisive work, \n              <i>Toward an Old Testament Theology</i>, has identified this unfolding \n              purpose in the Old Testament, as God's revelation of Himself as \n              the God of Promise. He argues inductively that, </p>\n            <blockquote> \n              <p>Such a category was sufficient to \n                encompass a great variety of biblical books, themes and concepts. \n                In spite of an almost universal chorus to the contrary, the mass \n                of data is neither intractable nor impossible. It does yield up \n                a single theology with a deliberate plan of God. Furthermore, \n                Scripture presents its own key of organization. The OT does possess \n                its own canonical inner unity which binds together the various \n                emphases and longitudinal themes. This is not a hidden inner unity. \n                It lies open and ready for all: The Promise of God.<sup><a name=\"Ref7\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue2/nmsofgod.htm#Note7\">[7]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n                </p>\n            </blockquote>\n            <p>Throughout the course of our study \n              we will seek to determine to what extent, if any, these names contribute \n              to understanding the immediate context and the broader unfolding \n              of God's purpose and plan of Promise. </p>\n            <p><b>Yahweh </b></p>\n            <p>The place to start in order to understand \n              the names for God is in the powerful way that God revealed Himself \n              to Moses. In the event where God speaks to Moses in the Burning \n              Bush (Exodus 3), He identifies Himself as the God of the patriarchal \n              covenant: </p>\n            <blockquote> \n              <p>5 Then He said, \"Do not come \n                near here; remove your sandals from your feet, for the place on \n                which you are standing is holy ground.\" 6 He said also, \"I \n                am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, \n                and the God of Jacob.\" Then Moses hid his face, for he was \n                afraid to look at God (vs. 5,6). </p>\n            </blockquote>\n            <p>This is no small claim. The covenant \n              with Abraham (Gen. 12:1-3; 15:1-21, 17:1-14), reaffirmed with Isaac \n              (Gen. 26:23-25), and to Jacob (Gen. 28:3-19; 35:9-14), included \n              the promise of : a great name, a great nation, a blessing to all \n              the nations, an everlasting kingdom, and a land to possess forever. \n              Abraham received this promise by faith (Gen. 15:6), at which point \n              God cut the covenant with Abraham by Himself (Gen. 15:9-19). In \n              doing this He demonstrated His everlasting commitment to upholding \n              His own promise! </p>\n            <p>As He appears in the Burning Bush, \n              God continues by expressing His concern for the nation of Israel \n              and tells Moses He has heard their \"cry\" (Ex. 3:9). Moses' \n              mission is to go and bring His people out of their oppression in \n              Egypt; this in keeping with the covenant that God has already made. \n              Moses responds: </p>\n            <blockquote> \n              <p>11 \"Who am I, that I should \n                go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the sons of Israel out \n                of Egypt?\" 12 And He said, \"Certainly I will be with \n                you, and this shall be the sign to you that it is I who have sent \n                you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall \n                worship God at this mountain.\" 13 Then Moses said to God, \n                \"Behold, I am going to the sons of Israel, and I will say \n                to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you.' Now they \n                may say to me, 'What is His name?' What shall I say to them?\" \n                14 God said to Moses, \"I AM WHO I AM\"; and He said, \n                \"Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'I AM has sent \n                me to you.'\" 15 God, furthermore, said to Moses, \"Thus \n                you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'The LORD (Yahweh), the God \n                of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the \n                God of Jacob, has sent me to you.' This is My name forever, and \n                this is My memorial-name to all generations. </p>\n            </blockquote>\n            <p>God is placing incomparable significance \n              on His own name. He identifies Himself as <i>Yhvh</i>, or <i>Yahweh \n              </i>which becomes the proper name of the God of Israel. It is used \n              6824 times in the Old Testament as God's name.<sup><a name=\"Ref8\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue2/nmsofgod.htm#Note8\">[8]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n              Little can be determined as to the meaning of this name from the \n              etymology, therefore we must look to God's character through word \n              and deed in order to understand it.<sup><a name=\"Ref9\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue2/nmsofgod.htm#Note9\">[9]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n              </p>\n            <blockquote> \n              <p>\"God's immediately preceeding \n                promise to Moses had been, \"Certainly I will be with you\" \n                (Ex. 3:12). So his assertion in verse 14 would seem to be saying, \n                \"I am present is what I am.\" Indeed the fundamental \n                promise of his testament is, \"I will be their God and they \n                will be My people\" (Ex. 6:7, etc.; contrast Hos. 1:9); thus \n                \"Yahweh,\" \"faithful presence,\" is God's testamentary \n                nature, or name (Ex. 6:2,4; Deut. 7:9; Isa. 26:4).\"<sup><a name=\"Ref10\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue2/nmsofgod.htm#Note10\">[10]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n                </p>\n            </blockquote>\n            <p>It is of no small significance that \n              God declares, \"This is My name forever, and this is My memorial-name \n              to all generations\" (vs. 15). Yahweh is instructing Moses that \n              He is to be known in the context of His everlasting covenant promise, \n              forever. A memorial-name (<i>zeker</i>) is a name which recalls \n              God's great deeds.<sup><a name=\"Ref11\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue2/nmsofgod.htm#Note11\">[11]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n              Several psalms use this word and demonstrate that the name, <i>Yahweh,</i> \n              had indeed become synonymous with His covenant actions toward Israel.<sup><a name=\"Ref12\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue2/nmsofgod.htm#Note12\">[12]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n              </p>\n            <blockquote> \n              <p><b>Ps. 145:7<br>\n                </b>7 They shall eagerly utter the <u>memory</u> (zeker) of Your \n                abundant goodness <br>\n                And will shout joyfully of Your righteousness. </p>\n            </blockquote>\n            <blockquote> \n              <p><b>Ps. 111:4 <br>\n                </b>4 He has made His wonders to be <u>remembered </u>(zeker); \n                The LORD is gracious and compassionate. </p>\n            </blockquote>\n            <p>The point of all this lies in the incomprehensible \n              fact that God has disclosed to Moses His very nature. His name proclaimed \n              Him as eternal, self-sustaining, self-determining, ever-faithful, \n              sovereign reality in an everlasting covenant relationship with Israel. \n              This was the starting point for Moses who was about to lead them \n              on a journey of faith and deliverance. We can be sure that Moses \n              understood Yahweh to mean more than an identifying label for God, \n              just as God disclosed it as more than a label. </p>\n            <p>Some have had problems with the use \n              of <i>Yahweh</i> as God's name occuring before the time of the exodus, \n              when, as we just discussed, God revealed Himself as Yahweh. Exodus \n              6:2 is an interesting verse in this regard. </p>\n            <blockquote> \n              <p>2 God spoke further to Moses and \n                said to him, \"I am the LORD (Yahweh); 3 and I appeared to \n                Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as God Almighty (El-Shaddai), but <i>by</i> \n                My name, LORD (Yahweh), I did not make Myself known to them. 4 \n                \"I also established My covenant with them, to give them the \n                land of Canaan, the land in which they sojourned. </p>\n            </blockquote>\n            <p>The patriarchs knew God as El-Shaddai \n              but now God was making known His name, Yahweh. This indicates that \n              God was at work <i>progressively revealing</i> His own character \n              through His name. He was unfolding His plan. </p>\n            <blockquote> \n              <p>God invited Moses to observe history \n                in the making as He disclosed His plans and actions. Moses not \n                only received the revelation from God but was prepared to recognize \n                God's power in events about to occur. God rehearsed with Moses \n                a history of His revelation to the forefathers, reminding Moses \n                that He was the same God whose plans had been developing for generations. \n                He was known historically by different names, but He remained \n                the same Divine Presence who gave purpose to earlier Israelite \n                leaders. . . . God's revelation builds off past revelations, prepares \n                His chosen leader to interpret present actions, and builds a path \n                to future revelations. God reveals Himself when His people need \n                Him. . . . Moses had a dimension of what he knew about God that \n                Abraham did not have. . . . That is not to say that earlier information \n                was wrong. It is only saying that earlier information was not \n                as complete as later information.<sup><a name=\"Ref13\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue2/nmsofgod.htm#Note13\">[13]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n                </p>\n            </blockquote>\n            <p>This idea of a progressive unfolding \n              of God's character through His name is overwhelmingly apparent in \n              Moses' writings. In addition to Ex. 6:2, He uses several combined \n              names for God in the context of specific events where a new aspect \n              of God's character is illustrated. </p>\n            <p>For example, in Genesis 22 when Abraham \n              is told to sacrifice Isaac, God reveals Himself as <i>Yahweh-raah</i> \n              (or Jehovah-jireh). In verse 8, Abraham said to Isaac, \"God \n              will provide for Himself the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.\" \n              When God did provide a ram for the burnt offering, \"Abraham \n              called the name of that place The LORD Will Provide (Yahweh-raah), \n              as it is said to this day, \"In the mount of the LORD it will \n              be provided\" (vs. 14). The <i>place</i> was called Yahweh-raah \n              but Yahweh revealed Himself as God who provides what he asks for \n              in return. </p>\n            <p>Likewise, in Exodus 17, Israel waged \n              war against the Amalekites. As long as Moses held up the staff of \n              God, Israel prevailed. When Moses' arms were lowered, the enemy \n              prevailed. Soon Aaron and Hur supported Moses' arms so that the \n              Amalekites were utterly defeated (see vs. 8-13). \"Then the \n              LORD said to Moses, \"Write this in a book as a memorial and \n              recite it to Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of \n              Amalek from under heaven.\" Moses built an altar and named it \n              The LORD is My Banner; and he said, \"The LORD has sworn; the \n              LORD will have war against Amalek from generation to generation\" \n              (vs. 14-16). The altar was named <i>Yahweh-nes</i> because God fought \n              the war for Israel and prevailed. </p>\n            <p>The Banner was Moses' rod and was a \n              symbol of Yahweh's faithful, powerful presence and working. It was \n              God's signal to rally to Him and among Jews it is also a word for \n              \"miracle.\" The lesson here is that Israel could not wage \n              warfare alone; Yahweh is My Banner!<sup><a name=\"Ref14\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue2/nmsofgod.htm#Note14\">[14]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n              </p>\n            <p>In another situation, God reveals a \n              broader moral aspect of <i>Yahweh</i>. When Moses is leading Israel \n              in the wilderness, his discouragement brings about a fascinating \n              discussion between he and Yahweh in Exodus 33 &amp; 34. Moses' real \n              need is for God to show him His glory. This will encourage him to \n              complete the mission that God has given him. </p>\n            <blockquote> \n              <p>17 The LORD said to Moses, \"I \n                will also do this thing of which you have spoken; for you have \n                found favor in My sight and I have known you by name.\" 18 \n                Then Moses said, \"I pray You, show me Your glory!\" 19 \n                And He said, <b>\"I Myself will make all My <u>goodness</u> \n                pass before you, and will proclaim the <u>name</u> of the LORD</b> \n                before you; and I will be <u><b>gracious </b></u>to whom I will \n                be gracious, and will show <u><b>compassion</b></u> on whom I \n                will show compassion.\" 20 But He said, \"You cannot see \n                My face, for no man can see Me and live!\" (boldface, underline, \n                mine) </p>\n            </blockquote>\n            <p>God reveals that His <i>goodness</i>, \n              <i>graciousness</i> and <i>compassion </i>are all wrapped up and \n              defined by His name, <i>Yahweh</i>. J.I. Packer asserts this as \n              the \"foundational announcement of his moral character\" \n              and something that is echoed later in Scripture (Ps. 86:15; Joel \n              2:13).<sup><a name=\"Ref15\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue2/nmsofgod.htm#Note15\">[15]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n              This is in answer to Moses' request of God to show His glory.

God's names progressively reveal His character. \n              Once understanding the full power of them, as Moses did in the incident \n              of the Burning Bush, it would be inconceivable to use them without \n              meaning. In addition, the name Yahweh is so intrinsically tied to \n              covenant promise that the theological meaning and practical significance \n              for Israel during the most desperate times of nationhood and in \n              the most fruitful times, is inescapable (compare Jeremiah's trust \n              in Yahweh, expressed during national exile, with David's overwhelmed \n              response to blessing in 2 Sam. 7)! </p>\n            <p><b>Elohim </b></p>\n            <p>In Genesis 1:1-2:4, Moses describes \n              the activity of the creation and uses the Hebrew name, <i>Elohim</i> \n              35 times in 35 verses as the agent of that creation. <i>Elohim</i> \n              is the plural form of <i>eloah</i>, and is translated as a name \n              for God 2570<sup><a name=\"Ref18\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue2/nmsofgod.htm#Note18\">[18]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n              times in the Old Testament.

This is further \n                born out by the fact that the form elohim occurs only in Hebrew \n                and in no other Semitic language, not even Biblical Aramaic.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref19\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue2/nmsofgod.htm#Note19\">[19]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n                </p>\n            </blockquote>\n            <p><i>Elohim</i> is a word that describes \n              the divine activity.

It is also \n              not surprising that the other instances of this name occur in the \n              context of the promise of progeny and the command to \"be fruitful \n              and multiply\" to Isaac and Jacob as well. Shaddai blesses, \n              nourishes and sustains the progeny of promise. </p>\n            <p>Walter Kaiser identifies the \"blessing\" \n              motif as the earliest expression of the promise.

In light of the probable early origins of Job \n              (quite possibly during the patriarchal period), and the fact that \n              the book is about the removal of blessing from Job in order to test \n              his faith, the choice of El-Shaddai as God's name seems most appropriate \n              if understood as the God of blessing, nourishment and sustenance! \n              </p>\n            <p>In support of this, there are other \n              passages in which El-Shaddai is used in connection with suffering. \n              Consider Naomi's words in 1:20, 21: \"She said to them, \"Do \n              not call me Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty (Shaddai) has \n              dealt very bitterly with me. 21\"I went out full, but the LORD \n              (Yahweh) has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since \n              the LORD (Yahweh) has witnessed against me and the Almighty (Shaddai) \n              has afflicted me?\" </p>\n            <p>Could it be true that El-Shaddai, the \n              God of blessing, is the same God who afflicts her? The lesson here \n              is the same as it was for Job and Abraham (in his inability to conceive \n              a child), that being that in order to experience God's sufficiency \n              and receive His blessing, we must understand our insufficiency. \n              Stone comments, \"The less empty of self we are, the less of \n              blessing God can pour into us; the more of pride and self-sufficiency, \n              the less fruit we can bear. Sometimes only chastening can make us \n              realize this.\" We have to understand that God's ultimate purpose \n              is that we know God and His great love for us.<sup><a name=\"Ref45\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue2/nmsofgod.htm#Note45\">[45]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n              </p>\n            <p><b>Conclusions </b></p>\n            <p>Our original questions considered whether \n              or not the name/names used for God were intended to have a material \n              effect on the theological content of the scripture? Or, are they, \n              generally speaking, arbitrary, interchangeable, and a simple reflection \n              of author preference? </p>\n            <p>There is little doubt that God fully \n              intended His name/names to be full of meaning regarding His nature \n              and character. His character is incontravertably tied up in His \n              covenant with the nation of Israel and therefore, so is His name. \n              There is no way to divorce the name of the meaning it possesses. \n              We have seen examples from Moses writings, David's, other psalmists, \n              Jeremiah, Ruth, Isaiah, and Job. All of them seem to carry an awareness \n              of the meanings of names for God and use them appropriately. The \n              fact that often the names are used together gives the reader insight \n              into the frustration of the author to communicate the whole character \n              of Israel's God. The most important aspect of these names for God, \n              and the element that connects them to the unfolding of the Promise \n              plan, is the aspect of <i>covenant</i> which we find in varying \n              degrees and with varied richness in all of them. God wants Israel \n              to know and understand Him this way. He wants them to understand \n              His ever-faithful longsuffering, and their required response of \n              obedience and faith. </p>\n            <p>Our answer has to be yes. The names \n              for God do have a material effect on the theological content of \n              Scripture. Yahweh stands out as the name by which God reveals His \n              own nature, but the others aid in filling the vaccuum of our finite \n              minds. There are, no doubt, places where the names used are due \n              to author preference, but even there, we will not find an inappropriate \n              name used. God is in control. </p>\n            <p>The most significant lesson learned \n              from this is how much God wants us to know Him. He was continually \n              at work expanding and revealing Israel's knowledge of Him through \n              the circumstances in their lives. He is at work expanding and revealing \n              Himself to us as well . God will show <i>us</i> His glory as He \n              did for Moses, because His covenant with us is part of who He is; \n              His commitment is everlasting. </p>\n            <p><strong><sup>NOTES</sup></strong></p>\n            <p><a name=\"Note1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n              No certain etymology has been established for this word.

The plural ending is usually descried as one of majesty \n              and not intended as true plural when used of God. The noun, elohim, \n              is consistently used with singular verb forms, adjectives and pronouns. \n              This objection to the Trinity in the name Elohim is rejected by \n              conservative scholars like Nathan Stone who also cites John Calvin. \n              They argue that the majestic plural (ie: that used of kings) was \n              not known then. The plural form with the singular pronoun, etc. \n              is fully consistent with the doctrine of the Trinity.

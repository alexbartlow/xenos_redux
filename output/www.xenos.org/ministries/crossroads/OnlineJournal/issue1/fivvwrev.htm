Dieter, Anthony A. Hoekema, \n              Stanley M. Horton, J. Robertson McQuilkin, and John F. Walvoord. \n              Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan Publishing House, 1987. 254 pp.<br>\n              <b>Reviewed by Mike Sullivan \n              </b>\n              <p>Sanctification is the process of \n                becoming more like Christ in our conduct and character. But how \n                does it occur? What disciplines, habits, and ways of thinking \n                and living do Christians need to cultivate to become \"sanctified\"? \n                In <em>Five Views on Sanctification</em>, Protestant theologians \n                explore these questions and share their understanding of how sanctification \n                occurs. Melvin Dieter summarizes the Wesleyan View, the Reformed \n                view is presented by Anthony Hoekema, Stanley Horton presents \n                the Pentecostal view, J. Robertson McQuilkin reviews the Keswick \n                position, and John Walvoord reviews the Augustinian-Dispensational \n                view. </p>\n              <p>A good systematic theologian exposes \n                readers to the opinions of a number of scholars on any important \n                issue. <em>Five Views on Sanctification</em> goes one step further \n                and allows the reader to listen in as theologians debate their \n                views on the role of the law, the ministry of the Holy Spirit, \n                the importance of spiritual experience, and other matters related \n                to Christian growth. Contributors begin each chapter by summarizing \n                and defending their understanding of sanctification. The other \n                authors are then given a chance to respond. The give-and-take \n                between each contributor allows the reader to hear the debate \n                from the proponents themselves. </p>\n              <p>It is difficult for one writer to \n                speak for an entire theological tradition. Opinions are not uniform \n                among those who call themselves Pentecostal, Wesleyan, Reformed, \n                etc.. As a result, the summaries provided in this book do not \n                always describe the perspective of individuals within a given \n                tradition. Hoekema, for example, parts from traditional reformed \n                theology in his interpretation of Rom. 7:13-25. Most reformed \n                theologians say the passage is about Paul's life as a Christian. \n                Hoekema says it describes Paul's life prior to conversion. Horton \n                does a better job introducing the reader to the differing views \n                held by Pentecostals. He carefully explains the different ways \n                holiness Pentecostals and members of the Assemblies of God pursue \n                Christian maturity. Then he admits his own preference for the \n                Assemblies of God approach and spends the rest of his essay explaining \n                the view of sanctification taught in their churches.</p>\n              <p>The contributors, with the exception \n                of Hoekema, are careful to place their theological perspective \n                in its historical context. Horton's account of the beginnings \n                of the Pentecostal movement in the U.S. is especially helpful \n                in this regard. His own grandparents became part of the Pentecostal \n                renewal in Los Angeles in 1906. From them he learned the specific \n                events and conversations that caused the Pentecostal movement \n                to later divide over the nature of sanctification. Dieter also \n                does a fine job of presenting the history of Wesleyanism. His \n                fellow contributor, J. Robinson McQuilkin praises his work by \n                saying, \"Christians of all persuasions can be grateful to \n                Melvin Dieter for summarizing (Wesley's) doctrine of sanctification, \n                giving us a biblical exposition of selected themes that are central \n                to that theology and tracing the development of holiness teaching...\" \n                <br>\n                (p. 53). </p>\n              <p>How will you benefit from reading \n                this book? It will help you understand the people and theological \n                currents that have shaped your current view of sanctification. \n                You will also learn the reasoning behind the practices and doctrinal \n                emphases visible in today's church. Best of all, as you listen \n                to the authors debate how to become more like Christ, you will \n                be challenged to think more deeply about how to live your life \n                in a way that is pleasing to Him.\n            </p></td>\n            <td width=\"10\" valign=\"top\"></td>\n            </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Book Review: Five Views of Sanctification","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/fivvwrev.htm"}

He does not say, \"And to seeds,\" \n          as <i>referring </i>to many, but <i>rather </i>to one, \"And to \n          your seed,\" that is, Christ.<i> 17 </i>What I am saying is this: \n          the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not invalidate \n          a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise.<i> \n          18 </i>For if the inheritance is based on law, it is no longer based \n          on a promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by means of a promise.<i> \n          19 </i>Why the Law then? It was added because of transgressions, having \n          been ordained through angels by the agency of a mediator, until the \n          seed should come to whom the promise had been made.</p>\n        <p>(<a name=\"Gal.%203:23-24\">Gal. 3:23-24</a>) \n          But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being \n          shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.<i> 24 </i>Therefore \n          the Law has become our tutor <i>to lead us </i>to Christ, that we may \n          be justified by faith.</p>\n        <p>(<a name=\"Gal.%203:28-29\">Gal. 3:28-29</a>) \n          There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, \n          there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.<i> \n          29 </i>And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's offspring, \n          heirs according to promise.</p>\n        <p>(<a name=\"Gal.%204:24\">Gal. 4:24</a>) This \n          is allegorically speaking: for these <i>women </i>are two covenants, \n          one <i>proceeding </i>from Mount Sinai bearing children who are to be \n          slaves; she is Hagar.</p>\n        <p>(<a name=\"Eph.%202:11-18\">Eph. 2:11-18</a>) \n          Therefore remember, that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who \n          are called \"Uncircumcision\" by the so-called \"Circumcision,\" \n          <i>which is </i>performed in the flesh by human hands--<i> 12 remember \n          </i>that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the \n          commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having \n          no hope and without God in the world.<i> 13 </i>But now in Christ Jesus \n          you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood of \n          Christ.<i> 14 </i>For He Himself is our peace, who made both <i>groups \n          into </i>one, and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall,<i> 15 \n          </i>by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, <i>which is </i>the Law of \n          commandments <i>contained </i>in ordinances, that in Himself He might \n          make the two into one new man, <i>thus </i>establishing peace,<i> 16 \n          </i>and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, \n          by it having put to death the enmity.<i> 17 </i>AND HE CAME AND PREACHED \n          PEACE TO YOU WHO WERE FAR AWAY, AND PEACE TO THOSE WHO WERE NEAR;<i> \n          18 </i>for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the \n          Father.</p>\n        <p>(<a name=\"Eph.%203:6-8\">Eph. 3:6-8</a>) <i>to \n          be specific, </i>that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members \n          of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through \n          the gospel,<i> 7 </i>of which I was made a minister, according to the \n          gift of God's grace which was given to me according to the working of \n          His power.<i> 8 </i>To me, the very least of all saints, this grace \n          was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ,</p>\n        <p>(<a name=\"Phil.%202:9-11\">Phil. 2:9-11</a>) \n          Therefore also God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name \n          which is above every name,<i> 10 </i>that at the name of Jesus EVERY \n          KNEE SHOULD BOW, of those who are in heaven, and on earth, and under \n          the earth,<i> 11 </i>and that every tongue should confess that Jesus \n          Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>\n        <p>(<a name=\"Col.%202:15\">Col. 2:15</a>) When \n          He had disarmed the rulers and authorities, He made a public display \n          of them, having triumphed over them through Him.</p>\n        <p>(<a name=\"Heb.%201:8-13\">Heb. 1:8-13</a>) \n          But of the Son <i>He says, </i>\"THY THRONE, O GOD, IS FOREVER AND \n          EVER, AND THE RIGHTEOUS SCEPTER IS THE SCEPTER OF HIS KINGDOM.<i> 9 \n          </i>\"THOU HAST LOVED RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HATED LAWLESSNESS; THEREFORE \n          GOD, THY GOD, HATH ANOINTED THEE WITH THE OIL OF GLADNESS ABOVE THY \n          COMPANIONS.\"<i> 10 </i>And, \"THOU, LORD, IN THE BEGINNING \n          DIDST LAY THE FOUNDATION OF THE EARTH, AND THE HEAVENS ARE THE WORKS \n          OF THY HANDS;<i> 11 </i>THEY WILL PERISH, BUT THOU REMAINEST; AND THEY \n          ALL WILL BECOME OLD AS A GARMENT,<i> 12 </i>AND AS A MANTLE THOU WILT \n          ROLL THEM UP; AS A GARMENT THEY WILL ALSO BE CHANGED.

while suffering, He \n          uttered no threats, but kept entrusting <i>Himself </i>to Him who judges \n          righteously;<i> 24 </i>and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the \n          cross, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His \n          wounds you were healed.<i> 25 </i>For you were continually straying \n          like sheep, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of \n          your souls.</p>\n        <p>(<a name=\"2%20Pet%20.3:10,%2013\">2 Pet .3:10, \n          13</a>) But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the \n          heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed \n          with intense heat, and the earth and its works will be burned up.&#xA0;

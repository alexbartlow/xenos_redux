The relationship \n                between these accounts has been, on the one hand, an assurance \n                to believers of the historical validity of the Gospels. On the \n                other hand, such comparisons have given rise to a multitude of \n                questions about which Gospel was written first, whether subsequent \n                authors borrowed from each other, and why there are differences \n                in wording, style and order as the authors report the same events. \n                All these issues form the Synoptic problem. </span></p>\n              <p><span>Taken \n                at face value, the Gospels seem to intend a sequential account \n                of Christ's life: they progress through his birth, baptism, temptation, \n                ministry, passion, death and then resurrection. A closer comparison \n                of the order of their accounts reveals several points at which \n                they differ over the sequence of events. Matthew places the healing \n                of the centurion's servant before the disciples' controversial \n                plucking of grain on the Sabbath and Jesus' healing of the man's \n                withered hand. Luke, however, places the healing of the centurion's \n                servant <i>after</i> these same events. Matthew places the clearing \n                of the temple immediately following the triumphal entry, before \n                the cursing of the fig tree. Mark places the clearing of the temple \n                on the day <i>after</i> the triumphal entry and <i>after</i> the \n                cursing of the fig tree. How are we to understand such apparent \n                chronological problems? </span></p>\n              <p><span>The \n                goal of this paper is certainly not to attempt some broad solution \n                to the synoptic problem. Rather, this paper will focus specifically \n                on the question of whether apparent chronological discrepancies \n                in the synoptic gospels threaten the doctrine of inerrancy. Can \n                solutions be offered to these discrepancies? How should the believer \n                in inerrancy harmonize these apparent sequential contradictions? \n                </span></p>\n              <p><span>...return \n                to <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#t\">top</a></span></p>\n              <p><a name=\"PART%20II:%20POSSIBLE%20APPROACHES\"><strong>PART \n                II: POSSIBLE APPROACHES</strong> </a></p>\n              <p><span><i>Rigid \n                Chronology<br>\n                </i>One approach Evangelical Christians have taken is to assume \n                that all of the pericopes contained in each of the Gospels were \n                arranged chronologically. It is clear that in the general outline \n                of the synoptics, all follow the same chronological pattern (see \n                <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#APPENDIX%20A:\">Appendix A</a>). For instance, no evangelist \n                places the temptation before Christ's baptism or in the middle \n                of his ministry.</span></p>\n              <p><span>But \n                some also feel that to be faithful to the doctrine of inerrancy, \n                every teaching and event recorded in the gospel accounts must \n                be chronologically ordered. Because of this, well-meaning Christians \n                posit absurd theories to explain gospel phenomena that conflict \n                with their view that the gospels are chronologically arranged. \n                As a result, Jesus is claimed to have raised Jairus' daughter \n                twice from the dead, was twice crowned with thorns, was denied \n                by Peter six or more times, and so on.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref1\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#Note1\">[1]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n                </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Topical \n                Arrangement<br>\n                </i>However, most Evangelical scholars have taken a different \n                approach. While they still believe the accounts to be historically \n                accurate and, in their general outline, chronologically accurate, \n                the events and teaching of Jesus' life are not necessarily arranged \n                chronologically but along topical or thematic lines. Today, this \n                has become the accepted definition of a Gospel - that it is more \n                than a sequential arrangement of data, more than a biography. \n                Consider the following statements from noted evangelicals such \n                as D.A. Carson, Craig Blomberg and Darrell Bock: </span></p>\n              <p><span>\"Though \n                these texts present a general outline to Jesus ministry, the choices \n                involving arrangement of material reveal how difficult it is in \n                some cases to determine an exact sequence. At some point, each \n                evangelist covered Jesus' teaching on a topical, not a chronological \n                basis.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref2\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#Note2\">[2]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n                </span></p>\n              <p><span>\"We \n                can avoid some of the difficulties created by the slightly differing \n                ordering of events from one gospel to another by recognizing that \n                chronology was not the only criterion for the arrangement of the \n                gospel materials.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref3\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#Note3\">[3]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n                </span></p>\n              <p><span>\"Some \n                of the material is organized along thematic lines, some according \n                to a loose chronology, still other pericopes are linked by some \n                combination of catchwords, themes, OT attestation, genre, and \n                logical coherence. The result is not exactly a history, biography, \n                theology, confession, catechism, tract, homage, or letter - though \n                it is in some respects all these. It is a 'Gospel,' a presentation \n                of the 'good news' of Jesus the Messiah.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref4\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#Note4\">[4]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n                </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Yet \n                the Topical Argument Doesn't Completely Solve the Problem...<br>\n                </i>To understand that thematic emphasis played a role in structuring \n                the Gospel accounts alleviates some of the historical or chronological \n                difficulties--but not all. There are passages that seem to make \n                chronological assertions that cannot be easily attributed to a \n                thematic approach. Evangelicals need to approach such passages \n                with more tools than just the broad appeal to topical rearrangement. \n                </span></p>\n              <p><span>Let's \n                examine one text that Bock offers as a case of topical arrangement. \n                Both Matthew and Luke record the raising of Jairus' daughter and \n                the woman with a hemorrhage, clearly a one-time event. Yet these \n                authors place it at different points in their gospel narratives: \n                Matthew places this story after Jesus' discussion with John's \n                disciples on fasting and Luke places it after the healing of the \n                Gadarene demoniac. For Bock and most other scholars, this is simply \n                a case in which one or both of the authors have placed this account \n                in their gospel not according to strict chronology, but may have \n                reordered to emphasize a certain point. If pressed, then, at least \n                one of the Evangelists would have to admit that the raising of \n                Jairus' daughter did not actually occur at the point they placed \n                it in their gospel. </span></p>\n              <p><span>Let's \n                look at these texts more closely. In Luke 8:40, Luke asserts that \n                it was while Jesus was returning from the other side of Galilee \n                (where he delivered the demoniac) that a crowd and Jairus approached \n                him. </span></p>\n              <p><span>Luke \n                8:40-41 \"<i>And <u>as Jesus returned</u>, the multitude welcomed \n                Him, for they had all been waiting for Him. And behold, there \n                came a man named Jairus, and he was an official of the synagogue; \n                and he fell at Jesus' feet, and began to entreat Him to come to \n                his house;\"</i> </span></p>\n              <p><span>According \n                to Luke, it was as the crowd was welcoming Jesus back from his \n                journey that Jairus approached him. Luke had already covered the \n                fasting discussion back in 5:33-39, well before Jesus' trip across \n                the lake. But notice the text from Matthew: just as Jesus finishes \n                his response to John's disciples concerning fasting, Matthew writes: \n                </span></p>\n              <p><span>Mat \n                9:18 \"<i><u>While He was saying these things to them</u>, \n                behold, there came a synagogue official, and bowed down before \n                Him, saying, \"My daughter has just died; but come and lay \n                Your hand on her, and she will live</i>.\" </span></p>\n              <p><span>Notice \n                that Matthew explicitly states that it was while Jesus was talking \n                with John's disciples that Jairus approached him. Can we say here \n                that Matthew is being strictly topical? Such a conclusion would \n                bring into question Matthew's explicit assertion of when this \n                event took place. The biblical text states here that it occurred \n                while Jesus was speaking to these people about fasting. </span></p>\n              <p><span>When \n                the text makes no statement about chronology or the ordering of \n                events, it seems reasonable to accept that there may be some reordering \n                of events for topical emphasis. If we accept that the Gospels \n                were written at least in part in order to teach and answer issues \n                of the early church, then it is no problem to the doctrine of \n                inerrancy that the authors would rearrange teachings, or even \n                events, for thematic emphasis. But in cases like the story of \n                Jairus, in which the text itself seems clearly to indicate a chronological \n                sequence, what are we to say? To assert that such cases are topical \n                seems to imply an amount of error or deceit on the part of the \n                Evangelists. As Linneman states, \"This pictures an autonomous \n                author who arbitrarily weaves material together that he sets before \n                his readers as a discourse from Jesus' lips. Would a disciple \n                of Jesus handle the words of his Lord and Master in this fashion?\"<sup><a name=\"Ref5\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#Note5\">[5]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n                A better, more complete answer is needed. </span></p>\n              <p><span>...return \n                to <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#t\">top</a></span></p>\n              <p><a name=\"PART%20III\"><strong>PART III: \n                DID THE AUTHORS INTEND A CHRONOLOGY?</strong> </a></p>\n              <p><span>To \n                what extent did each gospel author intend to record the events \n                of Christ's life in a chronological fashion? This is a key question \n                concerning the inerrancy of the synoptics. If we can determine \n                that the authors were deeply concerned with rigid chronological \n                accuracy, then the thematic argument may not be applicable. Or, \n                it is also possible that one author simply had more concern for \n                chronology in his account than the others and this may help us \n                resolve conflicting accounts. </span></p>\n              <p><a name=\"MATTHEW%20By%20Tom%20Dixon\"></a><strong>MATTHEW</strong> \n                <br>\n                <span>By Tom Dixon </span></p>\n              <p>Arguments FOR Chronological Emphasis \n                in Matthew: </p>\n              <p><span><i>Matthew \n                alone was an eyewitness to most of the events he records. <br>\n                </i>In constructing his Gospel, Luke relied entirely on other \n                written sources and the eyewitness testimony of certain individuals. \n                Mark may have known Jesus and may have followed him to a greater \n                or lesser extent than Luke, but his primary source for the writing \n                of his Gospel seems to have been Peter. Matthew, however, was \n                one of Jesus' twelve disciples who followed him and knew him closely \n                during his ministry. Goodspeed thus argues that Matthew would \n                have known better than Mark and Luke the sequence of events during \n                Christ's ministry, and he suggests that this concern for accurate \n                chronology was the reason for Matthew's apparent reworking of \n                Mark's material: </span></p>\n              <p><span>\"But \n                Matthew is in general not at all bound by Mark's order, from which \n                he departs freely. We remember that Peter had nothing to do with \n                that order; Mark had to develop it himself after Peter was gone, \n                so it is no wonder that Matthew found it unsatisfactory. Yet Matthew's \n                procedure is plainly that of a man who has definite information \n                about the order of events, such as Mark did not have... [Matthew] \n                evidently considered himself better informed as to the sequence \n                and order of the events of the Marcan narrative than Mark was...\"<sup><a name=\"Ref6\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#Note6\">[6]</a></sup> \n                &#xA0; </span></p>\n              <p><span>It \n                is true that because Matthew was an eyewitness, we can be assured \n                that the events and teachings he records are accurate and occurred \n                as he says they did. However, it does not necessarily follow that \n                because Matthew was an eyewitness he recorded the life of Christ \n                on a strictly chronological basis. He may very well have been \n                more concerned with accurately communicating principles or highlighting \n                certain themes of Christ's ministry. In addition, Mat 9:9 shows \n                he was not an eyewitness to the entire ministry - he was called \n                to discipleship in the middle of Jesus' ministry. Thus, his status \n                as an eyewitness indeed assures us of his accuracy, but not of \n                his motives for writing his gospel. </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Matthew's \n                duties as a government official had disciplined him in system \n                and accuracy. <br>\n                </i>Several scholars point out that Matthew, unlike other disciples, \n                was a trained employee of the government, and that he, therefore, \n                understood the value and practice of recording accurately. \"Whatever \n                his character, his duties as a government official had disciplined \n                him in system and accuracy and had developed a capacity for orderly \n                thought and methodical writing which fitted him for an immortal \n                task as a biographer of Jesus Christ.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref7\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#Note7\">[7]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n                Here again, these arguments secure Matthew's integrity and accuracy, \n                but do not necessarily prove that Matthew constructed a strictly \n                chronological account. </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Matthew \n                at several points makes definite sequential or chronological statements. \n                <br>\n                </i>Matthew sometimes makes definite statements about the sequential \n                flow of his narrative. For example, in Matt 9:18, Matthew states \n                that while Jesus was talking with the disciples of John about \n                fasting Jairus approached Jesus concerning his daughter. In Matthew \n                13, Matthew connects the flow of events by recording that Jesus \n                and his disciples went out of the house to teach the multitudes \n                (13:1) and then came back into the house to discuss what Jesus \n                had said (13:36). Although there are only a handful of these sequential \n                statements in the gospel, they exist. To deny that events actually \n                occurred as Matthew asserts they did would be to deny the doctrine \n                of inerrancy. </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Matthew \n                refers to time more often than Mark. <br>\n                </i>Kingsbury comments that \"Matthew often utilizes temporal \n                phrases simply to designate some point in time that otherwise \n                remains distinct...

It is not proven that Luke used Matthew's gospel \n                as a source for his own, nor even that Mark's gospel was written \n                first. But the evidence seems to indicate Luke did know both of \n                these works, that he sought to write a chronological history of \n                Jesus' life and the spread of the early church, and, in doing \n                so, he followed Mark's order rather than Matthew's.<i> </i></span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Matthew \n                emphasizes the teaching ministry of Jesus.<br>\n                </i>Matthew is highly didactic.

Within \n                his broad framework of Jesus' life, Mark uses many different phrases \n                that intimate successions of chronological events. For instance, \n                when it says in Mark 4:35 \"And on that day\", we understand \n                it was the same day that Christ gave out many parables.<sup><a name=\"Ref13\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#Note13\">[13]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n                Likewise, in Mark 1:12, Mark records that \"Immediately, the \n                Spirit impelled Him to go to wilderness.\" This teaches that \n                Jesus immediately withdrew to the wilderness after being baptized. \n                Words and phrases such as these often signify a sequential relationship \n                between events. At least 25 instances of these kinds of indications \n                of chronology exist in the book of Mark, not including the Passion \n                Week.<sup><a name=\"Ref14\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#Note14\">[14]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n                Mark must have intended to present the events of Jesus' life with \n                a significant amount of emphasis on chronology. </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Peter, \n                an eyewitness, was a source. <br>\n                </i>Tradition has it that Peter was Mark's source for his gospel. \n                Most evangelical scholars believe or assume this to be so.

Bock \n                insists that Luke uses the term to refer to his basic chronological \n                arrangement. However, Luke also orders the events of Jesus' life \n                according to the basic flow of salvation-history and the geographical \n                movement of Jesus' ministry.

For example, Luke often makes reference \n                to a piece of the preceding narrative that shows a sequence from \n                one to the next (e.g. \"Now while the people were in a state \n                of expectation...\" or \"And he arose, left the synagogue, \n                and entered Simon's house\"). </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Luke \n                rearranges primarily teaching material found in Matthew and Mark. \n                <br>\n                </i>The nature of teaching material is different than the nature \n                of historical events. It is much more reasonable to think that \n                Jesus might have said the exact same thing on more than one occasion \n                than that he would do the exact same thing twice. The largest \n                portions of Luke's narrative that are out of sequence with the \n                other synoptic gospels are teachings and sayings. Darrell Bock \n                says, </span></p>\n              <p><span>\"Problematic \n                texts [in examining Luke compared to Matthew] involve sayings \n                or parables where factors raise uncertainties about a direct connection. \n                Three types of situations raise uncertainty: (1) one gospel writer \n                may place in one location what the other gospel writer has in \n                a different place; (2) one writer may bring together material \n                that another writer has in separate locations; (3) the accounts \n                may be rendered in significantly different terms.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref20\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#Note20\">[20]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n                </span></p>\n              <p>Arguments AGAINST Chronological Emphasis \n                in Luke: </p>\n              <p><span><i>Luke \n                clearly organizes some events according to a common theme. <br>\n                </i>Though Luke primarily rearranges the teaching material found \n                in Matthew and Mark, he does occasionally reorder events. For \n                example, Luke includes the imprisonment of John the Baptist in \n                his introduction to the prophet's ministry (3:1-20), rather than \n                at the time when the event actually took place. Matthew and Mark \n                include this account chronologically much later than Luke. He \n                apparently chose to organize this particular event by its topic \n                rather than its sequential relationship to the other events in \n                the life of Christ. The same is true of Luke's description of \n                Jesus' rejection in Nazareth (4:16-30). Whereas Matthew and Mark \n                tell of this event in terms of its chronology, Luke uses it in \n                his introduction to Jesus' ministry in Galilee (4:14-15). These \n                two examples show that Luke does not always emphasize chronology \n                over other styles of organization. </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Luke \n                sometimes employs indefinite transitional words and phrases that \n                fail to indicate a definite chronology. <br>\n                </i>As stated above, Luke sometimes fails to indicate whether \n                one event in his narrative is sequentially related to the one \n                that comes before. The use of the terms and phrases \"And,\" \n                \"Now,\" \"And it came about\" do not tell the \n                reader anything about the order of events. When Luke uses the \n                transitional terms and fails to give any other indication of chronological \n                sequencing, then we cannot assume that he intends the events in \n                his account to be chronologically ordered. </span></p>\n              <p>Conclusions</p>\n              <p><span>The \n                following conclusions are warranted based upon the data presented \n                above. </span></p>\n              <p><span>1. \n                The Synoptic Gospels agree in their broad chronology of Jesus' \n                life. <br>\n                2.

     IV: PRINCIPLES OF HARMONIZATION </a></strong></p>\n              <p><span>When \n                the believer in inerrancy encounters an apparent chronological \n                contradiction between the synoptics, what should be done? The \n                following are questions to ask in order to methodically work towards \n                a solution. </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Can \n                it be confirmed that both passages are describing the same event? \n                <br>\n                </i>There are many cases in which the gospels seem to be relating \n                the same event, when in actuality they are not. Matthew, Mark \n                and Luke describe the anointing of Jesus by a woman while at the \n                home of Simon. Matthew and Mark place the event during Christ's \n                last week, whereas Luke places it early in his gospel, during \n                the Galilean ministry. The event seems basically the same in all \n                three gospels: Jesus at dinner at Simon's house, a woman enters \n                and pours perfume on Jesus. However, in Matthew and Mark, Jesus \n                is at Simon the Leper's house in Bethany, and the woman pours \n                perfume on his head. In Luke, Jesus is at Simon the Pharisee's \n                house in Galilee, and the woman pours perfume on his feet. A closer \n                comparison reveals that these are most likely two similar, but \n                different events. Over the course of his three-year ministry, \n                Jesus healed many lepers, cast out many demons, and had dinner \n                with many people. Is there enough detail given in both accounts \n                to verify that the two accounts are describing the same event? \n                </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Could \n                this have been a repeated teaching of Jesus? <br>\n                </i>If the passages in question involve a teaching of Jesus, it \n                is possible that Jesus taught the same thing on different occasions, \n                in different places. Thus it is difficult to prove any contradiction \n                in chronology. Parables are a good example of this - Jesus probably \n                did not just give them once, but used them over and over as teaching \n                tools. Mark says as much in 4:33-34: \"With many such parables \n                he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it; he did \n                not speak to them without a parable, but privately to his disciples \n                he explained everything.\" Thus, as Stein says, \"It is \n                clear that Mark sees the parables of 4:3-32 as a summary collection \n                and not a chronology of consecutive parables that Jesus taught \n                in a single day. Thus Matthew felt free to add to the collection, \n                and Luke could place the parables of the mustard seed and the \n                leaven in another location.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref21\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#Note21\">[21]</a></sup> \n                &#xA0; With nearly any discrepancy involving the placement or \n                timing of a teaching in the Gospels, the problem can be explained \n                by the fact that Christ was an itinerant teacher and gave the \n                same content on repeated occasions. </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Are \n                the authors explicitly indicating sequential connection to other \n                events? <br>\n                </i>As Augustine says in<i> Harmony of the Gospels, </i></span></p>\n              <p><span>\"When \n                the order of times is not apparent, we ought not to feel it a \n                matter of any consequence what order any of them may have adopted \n                in relating the events. But whenever the order is apparent, if \n                the evangelist then presents anything which seems to be inconsistent \n                with his own statements, or with those of another, we must certainly \n                take the passage into consideration, and endeavor to clear up \n                the difficulty.\" </span></p>\n              <p><span>When \n                one or both of the authors do not make specific statements about \n                chronology or sequence, then the possibility that the arrangement \n                is topical must be considered. The author has possibly rearranged \n                the pericope for didactic emphasis. For example, in Luke 6:1-5, \n                the author provides an account of a debate concerning the Sabbath \n                day. Immediately following, in Luke 6:6, the next pericope is \n                introduced by \"<i>and it came about on another Sabbath</i>.\" \n                Obviously this is not indicating a chronological, but a topical \n                connection. If he is not making an explicit claim to chronological \n                sequence, then there is not necessarily a contradiction. </span></p>\n              <p><span>Is \n                one author explicitly connecting the passage to a sequential narrative? \n                If so, then the other account should be analyzed to determine \n                whether or not it is possible (1) a topical rearrangement or (2) \n                an omission of intervening events has taken place. If both authors \n                seem to explicitly connect the passage to different preceding \n                events, then the apparent contradiction remains. </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Do \n                the authors provide details in the narrative that infer a sequence? \n                <br>\n                </i>Sometimes an author does not explicitly state the sequential \n                location of a passage, but the details implicit in the passage \n                seem to indicate a sequence. A comparison between the placement \n                of the calling of the disciples in Mark and Luke serves to illustrate \n                the importance of implicit details. Mark and Luke follow the same \n                general sequence at the beginning of Christ's ministry in Capernaum \n                with one exception. Mark places the calling of the disciples at \n                the beginning of these events, while Luke inserts them several \n                pericopes later. </span></p>\n              <p><span>The \n                textual clues slightly favor Luke as the chronologically accurate \n                account. Mark gives very little indication of sequence. He simply \n                states that the calling happened as Jesus was walking by the Sea \n                of Galilee. It is also significant that Mark includes this event \n                directly after a general description of Jesus ministry in Galilee. \n                Seemingly, Luke's textual clues are not a great deal more useful. \n                His description of the calling of the disciples follows the general \n                statement that \"<i>Jesus kept on preaching in the synagogues</i>.\" \n                However, the description in 5:1 that \"<i>the people were \n                crowding around him</i>\" seems to describe a circumstance \n                that is similar to the situation at the end of Luke 4, where Luke \n                says that \"<i>the people tried to keep him from leaving them</i>.\" \n                In this case, the textual clues infer that Luke is more sequential \n                and Mark is more topical. </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>What \n                purpose might the authors have for rearranging the event?

As students \n                of the Bible who hold to the inerrancy of scripture, how are we \n                to deal with these apparent chronological discrepancies? </span></p>\n              <p><span>Before \n                screening our passages through the Principles of Harmonization, \n                let's look at the following chart, which compares the passages \n                step by step, to help us determine whether or not the authors \n                use chronology. </span></p>\n              <div>\n                <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"400\">\n                  <tr> \n                    <td width=\"200\"><small>HEALING OF SERVANT</small></td>\n                    <td width=\"200\">&#xA0;</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr> \n                    <td width=\"200\"><small>Matthew 8:5</small><br>\n                      </td>\n                    <td width=\"200\"><small>Luke 7:1-10</small><br>\n                      </td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr> \n                    <td width=\"200\" valign=\"top\"><small><em>Before</em><br>\n                      Coming down from mountain - Sermon on Mount <br>\n                      &#xB7;

Not really. The authors are recording \n                the same event. We must look under principle 3 for our harmonization. \n                </span></p>\n              <p><span>However, \n                with the plucking of the grain and the withered hand synagogue \n                healing, we have a problem. Matthew apparently reports these events \n                as back to back incidents while Luke seems to be reporting them \n                as separate incidents. Matthew states, \"<i>And departing \n                from there, He went into their synagogue. And behold, there was \n                a man with a withered hand.</i>\" On the other hand, Luke's \n                transition phrase states, \"<i>And it came about <u>on another \n                Sabbath</u>, that He entered the synagogue... and there was a \n                man there whose right hand was withered</i>.\" One report \n                seems back to back, the other doesn't. Is it possible that we \n                have two separate events? Could there be two grain plucking rounds \n                with the Pharisees? It is certainly possible, but not definite. \n                Matthew's transition phrase states, \"<i>And departing from \n                there, he went into their synagogue</i>.\" After a closer \n                examination, Matthew doesn't <u>explicitly</u> state rigid back \n                to back chronology. Days, even weeks could have elapsed between \n                verse 8 and 9. It is very difficult to tell - the language is \n                not explicit. The only conclusion we can draw is this: if verses \n                8 and 9 are rigidly back to back, then we might have two separate \n                grain plucking incidents. If these verses are not rigidly back \n                to back, then the authors are relaying the same story, instead \n                of a repeated event. </span></p>\n              <p><span><em>Could \n                this have been a repeated teaching of Jesus? <br>\n                </em>This does not apply since these are events, not teachings \n                per se. </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Are \n                the authors explicitly indicating sequential connection to other \n                events? <br>\n                </i>Here a credible harmonization may be found. First, the initial \n                problem: Matthew includes the Grain Plucking and Withered Hand \n                healing several chapters after the Centurion Slave healing while \n                Luke places this event before the Centurion Slave healing. The \n                solution is that neither Matthew nor Luke indicate explicit chronology \n                between these two events. Note that Matthew records the healing \n                of Peter's mother-in-law immediately after the Centurion Slave \n                healing, yet the textual clues do not explicitly state this to \n                be a chronological transition. In fact, it seems that Matthew \n                focuses on thematic topics between our events in question (between \n                chapters 8 and 12). To be sure, his language does not explicitly \n                state chronology. In the same way, Luke does not express explicit \n                chronology between these two events either. As was pointed out \n                earlier, Luke could have easily rearranged the Grain Plucking/Withered \n                Hand healing with the Centurion's Servant healing. Therefore, \n                if either or both of the authors are not insisting on chronology \n                and the language seems to point towards a thematic approach, we \n                don't have an apparent chronological inconsistency between Matthew \n                and Luke. </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Do \n                the authors provide details in the narrative that infer a sequence? \n                <br>\n                </i>Both place the choosing of the 12 disciples near our passages \n                in question. Yet this doesn't really address our problem. </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>What \n                purpose might the authors have for rearranging the event? What \n                are the thematic or topical connections of the event to material \n                that comes before or after? <br>\n                </i>It seems Matthew was focusing on a healing theme in chapters \n                8-9, and on a Pharisaic opposition theme in chapter 12. Therefore, \n                it seems that Matthew could have rearranged his events to follow \n                these themes. Luke's Grain Plucking follows on the heels of the \n                Pharisaic opposition while the Centurion's Son healing is an introduction \n                into his healing theme of chapter 7. Therefore, Luke too could \n                have rearranged his events to follow these thematic lines. </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Resolution: \n                <br>\n                </i>It appears both Matthew and Luke reordered events based along \n                thematic lines and therefore, we have no chronological contradiction. \n                The language leaves room for that. Neither Matthew nor Luke indicate \n                explicit chronology between the two events in question. Although \n                the healing of the centurion's servant is not a repeated event, \n                there is a possibility of two different Grain Plucking events. \n                Again, no chronological discrepancies can be ascertained. </span></p>\n              <p>2.

Matthew, on the other hand, states that it was while John \n                the Baptist's disciples were talking with Jesus at Matthew's house \n                that Jairus approached him. Many Christians have wrestled with \n                this apparent contradiction, and some have even concluded that \n                the event must have happened twice - that Jairus daughter died \n                and was raised by Jesus on two different occasions!<sup><a name=\"Ref22\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#Note22\">[22]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n                </span></p>\n              <p><span>Liberal \n                scholars, of course, see evidence here of conflicting oral traditions: \n                \"This may be because Matthew is drawing upon an independent \n                tradition (e.g., the Galilean tradition, proposed by Lohmeyer), \n                or it may be an instance of Matthew's simplification of a story \n                in the interests of catechetical use.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref23\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#Note23\">[23]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n                Surprisingly, Evangelicals like Stein offer a similar solution: \n                \"We can probably explain this difference in order by assuming \n                that in the oral period the account of Jesus' raising of Jairus' \n                daughter circulated as an independent unit whose meaning was complete \n                in itself.\" Stein goes on to say that individual pericopes \n                like the healing of Jairus' daughter \"are often best interpreted \n                as self-contained units whose connection with the surrounding \n                materials should not be pressed.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref24\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#Note24\">[24]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n                </span></p>\n              <p><span>But \n                Matthew makes the explicit assertion that it is connected! In \n                Matthew's account, Jesus arrives in Capernaum, heals a paralytic, \n                calls Matthew and attends his party, then gets into a discussion \n                with John the Baptist's disciples at that party about fasting. \n                Matthew states that it was <i>while he was talking with John's \n                disciples that Jairus approached him</i>. Mark, however, writes \n                that it was when Jesus arrived in the boat that a great multitude \n                approached him - such a great multitude that Jesus was unable \n                to move away from the seashore. Then Jairus approached him. In \n                this case, merely saying that the order is not important, as Stein \n                does, hardly solves the problem. The text makes clear assertions \n                about order. </span></p>\n              <p><span>So \n                which is it? Did Jairus approach Jesus at the seashore or at Matthew's \n                party? Let's work methodically through the principles of harmonization. \n                </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Can \n                it be confirmed that both passages are describing the same event? \n                <br>\n                </i>Yes, the synoptics are all describing the same event. We are \n                given details such as Jairus' name, the age of his daughter, the \n                daughter's name, the cynical reaction of the mourners, and numerous \n                other significant details. Most importantly, all three synoptics \n                record the story of the healing of woman with the hemorrhage that \n                occurred on the way to Jairus' house. That all of these details \n                and events would happen twice is hard to believe. </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Could \n                this have been a repeated teaching of Jesus? <br>\n                </i>This question does not apply. In this situation we are dealing \n                with a specific event rather than a parable or teaching. </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Do \n                the authors provide details in the narrative that infer a sequence? \n                <br>\n                </i>Yes - Mark and Luke make mention of a huge crowd that greeted \n                Jesus at the seashore, and then they also mention that a crowd \n                followed Jesus on the way to Jairus' house. They seem to infer \n                that this was the same crowd, and thus that Jairus' approach to \n                Jesus occurred soon after he arrived in the boat and was met by \n                the crowd. </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Are \n                the authors explicitly indicating sequential connection to other \n                events? <br>\n                </i>Matthew definitely does. His states that \"while he was \n                saying these things to them, behold, there came a synagogue official, \n                and bowed down before him, saying, 'My daughter has just died...'\"(9:18). \n                To assert that Jairus approached Jesus at any other time would \n                raise questions about the inerrancy of Matthew 9:18, for he makes \n                an explicit assertion about the sequence of events. </span></p>\n              <p><span>Mark \n                does not make an explicit statement of sequence, but gives a strong \n                impression that it was while Jesus was gathering about Jesus at \n                the seashore: </span></p>\n              <p><span>\"<i>And \n                when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, \n                a great multitude gathered about Him; and He stayed by the seashore. \n                And one of the synagogue officials named Jairus came up, and upon \n                seeing Him, fell at His feet,</i>...\" (5:21) </span></p>\n              <p><span>Luke \n                is the least specific: </span></p>\n              <p><span>\"<i>And \n                as Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed Him, for they had all \n                been waiting for Him. And behold, there came a man named Jairus</i>,...\" \n                (8:40) </span></p>\n              <p><span>We \n                would have to answer then, that Matthew does make an explicit \n                sequential connection, whereas Mark and Luke do not. So in this \n                case, although Matthew is the least chronologically-concerned \n                of the three synoptics, we must first accept that in this case \n                Matthew's account is chronologically accurate. How then can we \n                explain the sequence that Mark and Luke infer? </span></p>\n              <p><span>Mark \n                seems to indicate strongly that Jesus was by the seashore when \n                Jairus approached him. Hendriksen says this is Mark's intent: \n                \"Jesus was again to be found 'beside the sea,' near Capernaum; \n                with a large crowd assembled about him, as usual. It was then \n                that Jairus fell prostrate at his feet.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref25\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#Note25\">[25]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n                In fact, as we open the various commentaries written on the Book \n                of Mark, one after the other, each commentary understands Mark \n                to portray Jesus by the lakeshore, surrounded by throngs, with \n                Jairus talking to him. Yet none of them address the problem this \n                creates when compared with Matthew's account.<sup><a name=\"Ref26\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#Note26\">[26]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n                </span></p>\n              <p><span>What \n                is important here is that neither Mark nor Luke make specific \n                statements about when Jairus approached Jesus. Both describe the \n                scene at Jesus' arrival, and then move on to the story of Jairus \n                without necessarily connecting the two scenes. As one scholar \n                says of Mark's account, \"Whether the incident of Jairus' \n                daughter takes place on the day of landing is not said; it is \n                represented as the next event of importance.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref27\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#Note27\">[27]</a></sup> \n                &#xA0; Luke is even more vague - he simply states that when Jesus \n                arrived, the multitudes welcomed him and had been waiting for \n                him. We can fairly conclude that Mark has omitted several events \n                that actually occurred between Mark 5:21 and 22, and that Luke \n                has followed Mark in this omission. Concerning the issue of the \n                crowds, there were always crowds that followed Jesus during this \n                period. Matthew's account of these events shows that the multitudes \n                were following Jesus each step of the way. So to argue that the \n                crowd that met Jesus at the seashore and the crowd that followed \n                him to Jairus' house are the same is unfounded textually. </span></p>\n              <p><span>Upon \n                Jesus' return from across the lake, the gospels reveal a general \n                sequence we can follow. </span></p>\n              <p><span>1. \n                Jesus was greeted/overwhelmed at the seashore by a crowd. <br>\n                2. Jesus healed a paralytic before a huge crowd. <br>\n                3. Jesus called Matthew and went to a party at his house. <br>\n                4. Jesus had a discussion with the Pharisees, and then the disciples \n                of John. <br>\n                5. Jairus approached Jesus about his dying daughter. <br>\n                6. Jesus healed the woman with the hemorrhage. <br>\n                7. Jesus raised Jairus' daughter. </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Resolution: \n                <br>\n                </i>Matthew records all these events in this sequence. Mark and \n                Luke record event #1, and then jump to #4. Mark and Luke have \n                placed events 2-4 at an earlier part of their gospels. In this \n                case, it is most likely that Mark and Luke have rearranged the \n                order for two reasons. One, Matthew makes more explicit statements \n                about the sequence of these events, whereas Mark and Luke are \n                more vague. Two, Matthew was an eyewitness to these events. These \n                events surrounded the calling of Matthew to discipleship and the \n                ensuing party he threw for Jesus at his house. He would have been \n                present when Jairus approached Jesus at his party. These were \n                undoubtedly events Matthew remembered well. </span></p>\n              <p><strong><b>3.

Not only is the order of events different in each author's \n                account, each writer seems also to indicate different days on \n                which the events took place. Mark clearly states that Jesus cleansed \n                the temple \"on the following day\" (11:12) after arriving \n                in Jerusalem, whereas Matthew seems to imply that Jesus cleansed \n                the temple the same day that he arrived in Jerusalem. </span></p>\n              <p><span>In \n                his commentary on Matthew, Eduard Schweizer writes concerning \n                this apparent discrepancy in chronology, \"<i>There is no \n                way to resolve the contradiction</i>.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref29\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#Note29\">[29]</a></sup> \n                &#xA0; Do the difficulties in this case undermine the authority \n                of the Gospels?

Several objections make this an untenable claim. \n                It would be very odd for Jesus to perform this intense display \n                of emotion on two consecutive days. The similarity in the descriptions \n                of the event in Mark and Matthew also make it unlikely that there \n                were two separate cleansings. Finally, when Mark describes Jesus' \n                arrival in Jerusalem, he says, \"<i>Jesus entered Jerusalem \n                and went to the temple. He look around at everything, but since \n                it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve</i>\" \n                (11:11). Here, Mark explicitly claims that Jesus did not engage \n                people at the temple, because it was late. </span></p>\n              <p><span>One \n                aspect of the narratives that probably is repeated is the stay \n                in Bethany. Matthew clearly states that, after the cleansing of \n                the temple, Jesus spent the night in Bethany: \"<i>Jesus left \n                them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night</i>\" \n                (21:17). Mark, on the other hand, says that Jesus spent the night \n                in Bethany before the cleansing of the temple. There is no need \n                to find a contradiction in the two accounts, since Jesus spent \n                a lot of time in Bethany during his final week. Spending the night \n                in a particular place is the kind of event that could easily be \n                repeated. </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Could \n                this have been a repeated teaching of Jesus? <br>\n                </i>The events are narrative not didactic, so this principle does \n                not apply in this case. </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Do \n                the authors provide details in the narrative that infer a sequence? \n                <br>\n                </i>We will answer these two questions simultaneously, first in \n                Matthew, then in Mark.

In light of this explicit sequential \n                statement, we must conclude that Matthew is not concerned with \n                the day on which each event took place. When he records that \"Jesus \n                entered the temple\" directly after the triumphal entry, Matthew \n                seems to imply that these events took place on the same day. Similarly, \n                when Matthew records that it was \"early in the morning\" \n                that Jesus cursed the fig tree, he seems to imply that it was \n                the morning of the day after he cleansed the temple. However, \n                neither of these statements makes an explicit claim to chronology. \n                For example, \"early in the morning\" does not specify \n                the morning of a certain day, only the time of day when the event \n                took place. Matthew could have been more definite by stating, \n                \"on the next morning.\" </span></p>\n              <p><span>Another \n                apparent discrepancy between Matthew and Mark concerns the discovery \n                of the withered fig tree. Matthew implies that it took place at \n                the same time that Jesus withered it. He says, \"Immediately \n                the tree withered. When the disciples saw this, they were amazed\" \n                (21:19b-20a). By describing the event in this way, the reader \n                assumes that the disciples discovered the withered tree at the \n                same moment that Jesus performed the miracle. However, Mark explicitly \n                states that the disciples' discovery of the withered fig tree \n                was the morning following the cleansing of the temple. Again, \n                Matthew is simply not concerned with the day on which these events \n                took place. A gap in time exists between Matthew 21:19 and 21:20. \n                That is, the fig tree withered immediately after Jesus cursed \n                it. The disciples, then, discovered it some time later, as Mark \n                records. </span></p>\n              <p><i><span>What \n                purpose might the authors have for rearranging the event?

Matthew has simply \n                put the two parts together in a typical topical arrangement.

While Matthew seems \n                to imply some chronology in his account, he is not definite. Mark, \n                on the other hand, makes explicit chronological claims that cannot \n                be dismissed. Given that Matthew may have re-worked Mark, it is \n                possible that Matthew simplified these events by arranging them \n                more topically, without concern for the day on which they took \n                place. </span></p>\n              <p><span>\"[Matthew] \n                is not so interested, as is Mark, in the actual day of the week \n                on which [the cleansing of the Temple] took place.

When this is done, \n                nearly every problematic passage can be explained, and possible \n                solutions can be offered for even the most difficult. </span></p>\n              \n              <p><strong><a name=\"APPENDIX%20A:\">APPENDIX \n                A:</a></strong> <br>\n                A Synoptic Comparison of the Major Periods of Christ's Life </p>\n              <div>\n                <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"399\">\n                  <tr> \n                    <td width=\"133\" valign=\"bottom\"><strong><small>Matthew</small></strong></td>\n                    <td width=\"133\" valign=\"bottom\"><strong><small>Mark</small></strong></td>\n                    <td width=\"133\" valign=\"bottom\"><strong><small>Luke</small></strong></td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr> \n                    <td width=\"133\" valign=\"middle\"><small>I.Beginnings \n                      (1:1-4:11) 12%</small></td>\n                    <td width=\"133\" valign=\"middle\"><small>I. \n                      Beginnings (1:1-13) 3% </small></td>\n                    <td width=\"133\" valign=\"middle\"><small>I. \n                      Beginnings (1:1-4:13) 15%</small></td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr> \n                    <td width=\"133\" valign=\"middle\"><small>II. \n                      Galilee (4:12-14:12) 39%</small></td>\n                    <td width=\"133\" valign=\"middle\"><small>II. \n                      Galilee (1:14-6:29) 31%</small></td>\n                    <td width=\"133\" valign=\"middle\"><small>II. \n                      Galilee (4:14-9:9) 20%</small></td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr> \n                    <td width=\"133\" valign=\"middle\"><small>III. \n                      Withdrawal from Galilee (14:13-17:21) 14% </small></td>\n                    <td width=\"133\" valign=\"middle\"><small>III. \n                      Withdrawal from Galilee (6:30-9:32) 19%</small></td>\n                    <td width=\"133\" valign=\"middle\"><small>III. \n                      Withdrawal from Galilee (9:10-50) 4%</small></td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr> \n                    <td width=\"133\" valign=\"middle\"><small>IV. \n                      Back to Galilee (17:22-18:35) 3%</small></td>\n                    <td width=\"133\" valign=\"middle\"><small>IV. \n                      Back to Galilee (9:33-50) 3%</small></td>\n                    <td width=\"133\" valign=\"middle\"><small>0% \n                      </small></td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr> \n                    <td width=\"133\" valign=\"middle\"><small>V. \n                      Judea &amp; Perea (19:1-20:34) 7%</small></td>\n                    <td width=\"133\" valign=\"middle\"><small>V. \n                      Judea &amp; Perea (10:1-52) 6%</small></td>\n                    <td width=\"133\" valign=\"middle\"><small>IV. \n                      Judea &amp; Perea (9:51-19:27) 40% </small></td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr> \n                    <td width=\"133\" valign=\"middle\"><small>VI. \n                      Passion &amp; Resurrection (21:1-28:20) 25%</small></td>\n                    <td width=\"133\" valign=\"middle\"><small>VI. \n                      Passion &amp; Resurrection (11:1-16:8) 38%</small></td>\n                    <td width=\"133\" valign=\"middle\"><small>V. \n                      Passion &amp; Resurrection (19:28-24:53) 21%</small></td>\n                  </tr>\n                </table>\n              </div>\n              <p><span>NOTE: \n                The percentages indicate what percentage of a particular Gospel \n                is covered in each major period.</span></p>\n              <p>....return to <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#PART%20II:%20POSSIBLE%20APPROACHES\">Part \n                II: Possible Approaches</a><br>\n                ...return to <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#t\">top</a></p>\n              \n              <p><a name=\"APPENDIX%20B:\"><strong>APPENDIX \n                B</strong>:</a><br>\n                Chronological Flow Of Mark </p>\n              <p><strong>I.

Mark gives very little indication of sequence. He simply \n                states that the calling happened as Jesus was walking by the Sea \n                of Galilee. In fact, Mark includes this event directly after a \n                general description of Jesus' ministry in Galilee. Luke's textual \n                clues are not a great deal more useful. His description of the \n                calling of the disciples follows the general statement that \"Jesus \n                kept on preaching in the synagogues.\" However, the description \n                in 5:1 that \"the people were crowding around him\" seems \n                to describe a circumstance that is similar to the situation at \n                the end of Luke 4, where Luke says that \"the people tried \n                to keep him from leaving them.\" </span></p>\n              <p><span>The \n                grouping of the calling of the disciples with material that precedes \n                it in Mark 1:14-15 indicates that Mark probably rearranged this \n                event in order to introduce Jesus' ministry in Galilee. Mark seems \n                to be introducing the main characters in the narrative to come, \n                so he inserts this important encounter between Jesus and a few \n                of his disciples. </span></p>\n              <p><span>Another \n                line of evidence for the chronology in Luke is to consider the \n                implications of each narrative if we regard it as chronological. \n                Mark's narrative states that the same disciples that Jesus called \n                in 1:16-20 were present with him in 1:29-31 at the healing of \n                Simon's mother-in-law. If it is taken as a chronological order \n                of events, Mark's account says that Jesus met the disciples, called \n                them and went with Simon to heal his mother-in-law. On the other \n                hand, if Luke's account is taken as chronologically accurate, \n                he says that Simon, at least, knew Jesus before Jesus called him \n                to follow him. This seems more likely. </span></p>\n              <p><span>Although \n                we cannot be decisive, Luke seems to be more sequential and Mark \n                more topical in this case. </span></p>\n              <p><span><i>Luke's \n                Rearrangement of the Rejection in Nazareth <br>\n                </i>There is enough common material between the account in Mark \n                and in Luke to think that these are parallel passages, describing \n                the same event. Mark places the event much later in Jesus' ministry \n                in Galilee than Luke does. In fact, Luke places the event at the \n                immediate beginning of his account of Jesus' ministry in Galilee. \n                Luke doesn't give any strong indication of sequence in his text. \n                Mark, on the other hand, introduces the rejection in Nazareth \n                by making a direct sequential connection with the previous event \n                (Jairus). In addition, Luke records the event directly following \n                a brief pericope that introduces the Galilean ministry, whereas \n                Mark's account of the rejection is centered between two events. \n                </span></p>\n              <p><span>In \n                this case, it seems likely that Mark has ordered this event in \n                its chronological sequence, whereas Luke has rearranged the event \n                to indicate the flavor of Jesus' ministry in Galilee. </span></p>\n              <p><span>...return \n                to <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#Luke%20agrees%20with%20Mark's%20chronology\">Luke \n                agrees with Mark's chronology</a><br>\n                ...return to <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#t\">top</a></span></p>\n              <p><strong><a name=\"BIBLIOGRAPHY\">BIBLIOGRAPHY \n                </a></strong></p>\n              <p><span>Darrell \n                Bock, \"The Words of Jesus in the Gospels: Live, Jive, or \n                Memorex\", in <i>Jesus Under Fire</i>, (Zondervan), 1995. \n                </span></p>\n              <p><span>D.A.Carson, \n                \"Intro to Matthew\", <i>Expositors Commentary</i>. </span></p>\n              <p><span>Jack \n                Dean Kingsbury, <i>Matthew: Structure, Christology, Kingdom</i>, \n                (Fortress Press, Philadelphia), 1975. </span></p>\n              <p><span>Eduard \n                Schweizer, <i>The Good News According to Matthew</i>, (John Knox \n                Press, Atlanta), </span></p>\n              <p><span>Charles \n                Erdman, <i>The Gospel of Matthew</i> </span></p>\n              <p><span>Craig \n                Blomberg, <i>The Historical Reliability of the Gospels</i>, (IVP), \n                1987. </span></p>\n              <p><span>Robert \n                H.

Mark uses the phrase \"It came about\" \n                to introduce the event that follows. In 2:14, Mark discusses the \n                calling of Levi (Matthew). He then reports in 2:15, \"And \n                it came about that He was reclining at the table in his house, \n                and many tax-gatherers and sinners were dining with Jesus.\" \n                There are at least two reasons to believe that Mark is arranging \n                these two events thematically rather than chronologically. First, \n                the phrase, \"And it came about\" does not indicate rigid \n                chronology. Second, Mark immediately proceeds with four other \n                instances of Pharisaic opposition. Therefore, it seems that Mark \n                links the calling of Levi with a description of the parties Jesus \n                used to have with the tax-gatherers and sinners. He probably uses \n                the calling of Levi as a springboard to discuss Pharisaic opposition. \n                We could imagine Mark thinking, \"While we're on the topic \n                of Matthew's calling--who is a tax-gatherer and sinner---we might \n                as well talk about the Pharisees and the problems they had with \n                the dinner parties Jesus had with the tax collectors and sinners.\" \n                <i>Return to <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/synoprob.htm#Ref17\">Text</a></i></span></p>\n              <p><span><a name=\"Note18\"><sup>[18]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n                <i>The Expositor's Bible Commentary</i>, Frank E.

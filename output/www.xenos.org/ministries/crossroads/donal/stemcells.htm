O'Math&#xFA;na</a></p>\n      <p>{Printed in <i>The Columbus Dispatch</i> on July 31, 1999, p. 10A}</p>\n      <p>A recent White House press release declared that the potential medical \n        benefits of stem cell research override others' ethical concerns. President \n        Clinton's National Bioethics Advisory Commission announced it is almost \n        ready to endorse this research. The Clinton Administration wants this \n        research federally funded, promising to obtain the cells \"in an ethically \n        sound manner.\" <br>\n      </p>\n      <p>Killing human embryos is the method proposed.<br>\n      </p>\n      <p>This research is morally wrong. Federally funding it may also be illegal. \n        In 1996 Congress banned using federal funds for research destroying human \n        embryos. Those regulations will be sidestepped by funding only research \n        done after the stem cells have been obtained. Private funds will be used \n        to kill the embryos. The ethic seems to be that it's okay to reap the \n        benefits of others' questionable deeds once we don't directly pay for \n        them.<br>\n      </p>\n      <p>This controversy began last year when researchers isolated stem cells \n        from human embryos. Stem cells have huge medical potential because they \n        can develop into almost any of the 210 different types of human cells. \n        Researchers hope to coax stem cells into becoming brain cells to treat \n        Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease. Other stem cells could be nudged into \n        becoming healthy pancreatic tissue to replace that of diabetic patients. \n        In theory, any tissue type could be grown to replace diseased or missing \n        tissues.<br>\n      </p>\n      <p>Stem cells hold great potential, but their supply is limited. However, \n        embryos (the term for fertilized eggs which have started dividing) contain \n        largely stem cells. Removing them, though, kills the embryo. The central \n        ethical question is whether the potential benefits of this research outweigh \n        the harm of destroying human embryos. <br>\n      </p>\n      <p>Thousands of human embryos are sitting frozen in infertility clinics \n        around the nation. After their brothers or sisters are born, their parents \n        often leave them frozen, unsure what to do with them. Wouldn't it be better \n        to use them for some good rather than letting them go to waste? A group \n        of thirty-three Nobel Prize winners told President Clinton there was a \n        \"moral imperative\" to pursue this research. One patient advocacy \n        group stated \"stem cell research is too promising to impede, slow, \n        or stop.\"<br>\n      </p>\n      <p>However, medical research must be guided by more than pragmatic, cost-benefit \n        evaluations. Human embryos are living human beings in their earliest stage \n        of development. They don't have to be viewed as human persons to realize \n        they are more than just biological specimens. A 1994 National Institutes \n        of Health panel concluded they ought to be treated with \"profound \n        respect.\" Yet the panel also approved of their destruction during \n        research. Noted bioethicist, Daniel Callahan, commented: \"I have \n        always felt a nagging uneasiness at trying to rationalize killing something \n        for which I claim to have profound respect.\"<br>\n      </p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.stemcellresearch.org\">Other researchers, physicians, \n        nurses, ethicists, and theologians oppose stem cell research using embryos.</a> \n        Medical research should always respect its subjects. Research involving \n        children and others who cannot give consent is internationally restricted \n        to ensure the subjects benefit personally and are not placed at significant \n        risk of harm. Destroying human embryos harms them because it has the same \n        consequences as killing other humans. We are all disturbed by premature \n        death because of the loss of potential. Who might she have become? What \n        might he have done? We are outraged when that death is unnecessarily caused \n        by others. Yet precisely the same potential is lost when embryos are destroyed \n        in research. Who would these embryos have become, if only they had been \n        protected? What if you or I were chosen as stem cells sources when we \n        were embryos?<br>\n      </p>\n      <p>Premature death also occurs from illnesses which stem cells might cure. \n        Research on treating these diseases should be promoted. But such laudable \n        goals and intentions do not justify killing other humans, even the smallest \n        human embryos. Their vulnerability cries out for their protection. Human \n        embryos are too small to see with the naked eye, too underdeveloped to \n        defend themselves, and apparently too inconsequential to warrant protection. \n        Yet the same could be said, and has been said (often in the name of greater \n        public goods), of other members of our species.<br>\n      </p>\n      <p>Thankfully, stem cell research can proceed without killing embryos. According \n        to an April 4th <i>Wall Street Journal</i> article, researchers have made \n        fat, bone, and cartilage cells from stem cells found in adult bone marrow. \n        Others developed various blood cells from stem cells in adult blood. Elsewhere, \n        drugs are being developed to activate natural stem cells within people's \n        tissues. Many of the treatments everyone wants could be developed without \n        killing human embryos. <br>\n      </p>\n      <p>Research which abuses its subjects is always morally tainted and casts \n        a shadow over the medical research enterprise. To fund stem cell research \n        while turning a blind eye to the killing of embryos is inexcusable. If \n        destroying them is morally unproblematic, why not fund that also? The \n        inconsistency raises red flags; so does claiming to profoundly respect \n        embryos while killing them. <br>\n      </p>\n      <p>Research should protect, not destroy, even the smallest and most vulnerable \n        stage of human life. To claim otherwise is to hold that some humans can \n        be used as means to the ends of others. History teaches that this belief \n        leads only to injustice and violence.</p>\n      <p>See also <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/stemcells_bush.htm\">Stem Cell Research: Bush's Policy</a></p>\n      \n    </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Ethical Issues in Stem Cell Research","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/stemcells.htm"}

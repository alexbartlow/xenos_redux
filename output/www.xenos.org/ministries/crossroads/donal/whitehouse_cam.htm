CAM courses in medical schools often promote CAM \n        rather than critically evaluate it. Unfortunately, the Report itself frequently \n        violates the very evidence-based principles it endorses. Several specific \n        examples will be given. The lack of diversity in the Commission&#x92;s \n        composition is most clearly reflected here. The sweeping recommendations \n        of the Report thus fail to prioritize where resources should be directed \n        and how those priorities should be determined.</p>\n      <p>Problems with the Report&#x92;s broad recommendations are most apparent \n        with spirituality. The Report treats spirituality like another therapy, \n        failing to recognize its deeply personal and sensitive nature. Neither \n        does the Report address the difficulties of addressing spiritual concerns \n        within healthcare. Spirituality should not be treated as a generic therapy. \n        The Report does not address the training of healthcare professionals to \n        appropriately and ethically address spirituality, nor does it tackle the \n        way some CAM therapies disguise their religious roots. In neglecting these \n        issues, the Report contributes to such covert promotion of religious practices. \n        The Report similarly fails to address the use of federal funds in promoting \n        spiritual practices or specific religions. This paper will propose ways \n        to address spiritual issues ethically within healthcare. </p>\n      <p>In summary, the Report&#x92;s all-encompassing recommendations are too \n        broad and impractical. The Report recognized how evidence-based principles \n        can recognize and promote the best within CAM, but then failed to adhere \n        to this approach itself. The Report missed an important opportunity to \n        promote dialogue on difficult but important issues surrounding CAM by \n        taking an advocacy position. A more nuanced approach was needed, in which \n        different criteria are used to evaluate different forms of CAM therapies. \n        Without this, the public will continue to be exposed to unproven, unsafe \n        CAM therapies, and public funds will be used in inappropriate and unjust \n        ways.</p>\n      <h2><a name=\"Introduction\"></a>Introduction</h2>\n      <p>In March 2000, President Bill Clinton established the White House Commission \n        on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy (WHCCAMP). The Commission&#x92;s \n        mission was to provide recommendations that would ensure that public policy \n        maximizes the potential benefits of complementary and alternative medicine \n        (CAM). Specifically, the mission was to address:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li> \n          <p>education and training of health care practitioners in CAM,</p>\n        </li><li> \n          <p>coordination of research to increase knowledge about CAM products,</p>\n        </li><li> \n          <p>provision of reliable and useful information on CAM to healthcare \n            professions, and</p>\n        </li><li> \n          <p>provision of guidance on the appropriate access to and delivery of \n            CAM.<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#3\">3</a></sup></p>\n      </li></ul>\n      <p>The twenty-member Commission held ten meetings and solicited input from \n        various healthcare professions and the public. Its Final Report was released \n        in March 2002 and will be referred to hereafter as the Report. </p>\n      <p>Included within the Report was a letter to the Secretary of the Department \n        of Health and Human Services from two of the Commissioners, Tieraona Low \n        Dog, M.D. and Joseph J. Fins, M.D. These Commissioners expressed important \n        concerns about the Report. In particular, they claimed that the Report \n        did not adequately appreciate the limitations of unproven and unvalidated \n        CAM interventions, and did not pay enough attention to the importance \n        of minimizing CAM risks. This letter adds important qualifying remarks \n        to the Report and will be referred to in this paper as the dissenting \n        letter.</p>\n      <h2><a name=\"CAMDefinition\"></a>CAM Definition</h2>\n      <p>The definition of CAM adopted by the Report is the following: &#x93;Complementary \n        and alternative medicine, or CAM, can be defined as a group of medical, \n        health care, and healing systems other than those included in mainstream \n        health care in the United States. CAM includes the worldviews, theories, \n        modalities, products, and practices associated with these systems and \n        their use to treat illness and promote health and well-being.&#x94; </p>\n      <p>This is a representative definition of CAM, but as such adopts problems \n        inherent with such far-reaching and all-encompassing definitions. CAM, \n        then, as used in the Report, stands for everything from the religious-philosophical \n        system of traditional Chinese medicine to individual herbal remedies. \n        While this accurately represents what is viewed as CAM, it leads to serious \n        problems when public policy is based on such a broad definition. </p>\n      <p>For example, public policy regarding the production and distribution \n        of herbal remedies should look very different to that regarding people&#x92;s \n        philosophical or religious beliefs and practices. Public policy must approach \n        health-related practices that invoke spiritual beings (like prayer, shamanism, \n        or Reiki) differently than it does acupuncture and nutrition. The importance \n        of these distinctions was not appreciated or addressed in the Report. \n        As two of the Commissioners stated in their dissenting letter, &#x93;In \n        sum, generic pronouncements about &#x91;CAM&#x92; neither serve the public \n        interest nor protect the public health.&#x94; A recommendation that CAM \n        be researched or covered by insurance or taught in medical school provides \n        little or no practical guidance for those who have to decide which forms \n        of CAM are deserving of such policies.</p>\n      <p>The other definitional approach taken in the Report was to describe the \n        general characteristics of CAM. Four characteristics were suggested: </p>\n      <ol>\n        <li> \n          <p>CAM commonly approaches patients in ways that include &#x93;a focus \n            on individualized treatments, treating the whole person, promoting \n            self-care and self-healing, and recognizing the spiritual nature of \n            each individual.&#x94;</p>\n        </li><li> \n          <p>CAM frequently has much in common with aspects of conventional medicine, \n            such as nutrition and preventive healthcare. </p>\n        </li><li> \n          <p>CAM therapies usually have little support from scientific study and \n            clinical research.</p>\n        </li><li> \n          <p>CAM therapies often focus on &#x93;the prevention of illness by enhancing \n            the vital energy, or subtle forces, in the body.&#x94; </p>\n      </li></ol>\n      <p>Again, these characteristics are so unspecific that they provide little \n        guidance in distinguishing CAM from conventional medicine. These same \n        characteristics have been reported before by the author of this paper, \n        while acknowledging their practical limitations for evaluating CAM.<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#4\">4</a></sup></p>\n      <p>Another problem with the Report&#x92;s approach arises because of the \n        significant overlap between conventional medicine and CAM as defined in \n        the Report. The only examples of CAM therapies that the Report specifies \n        as being proven safe and effective are exercise, nutrition, and stress \n        management. But these interventions have been evaluated and affirmed within \n        conventional medicine. Why then should they be used as support for the \n        benefits of CAM? Many of the characteristics of CAM listed in the Report \n        are completely compatible with conventional medicine. In fact, the medical \n        ethics literature contains many calls for an emphasis on many of these \n        approaches as part of the art of medicine and the importance of bedside \n        manner. If these practices should characterize all forms of medicine, \n        their ascription to CAM does nothing to help clarify what is meant by \n        CAM.</p>\n      <p>To give practical guidance and direction, broad definitions and lists \n        of characteristics are severely limited. For this reason, CAM must be \n        subdivided to assist further discussions. One such scheme has been offered \n        by this author, dividing CAM into five categories:<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#4\">4</a></sup></p>\n      <ol>\n        <li> \n          <p>Complementary therapies</p>\n        </li><li> \n          <p>Scientifically unproven therapies</p>\n        </li><li> \n          <p>Scientifically questionable therapies</p>\n        </li><li> \n          <p>Energy medicine</p>\n        </li><li> \n          <p>Quackery or fraud</p>\n      </li></ol>\n      <p>Therapies within each category raise different questions and issues. \n        Rather than making sweeping recommendations for all CAM, public policy \n        recommendations should vary from one category to another. For example, \n        research funding may be recommended for a promising herbal remedy, but \n        a different recommendation should be offered regarding prayer and health. \n        Medical schools may want to add information about scientifically unproven \n        remedies (like many herbal remedies) but not about life energy medicine \n        (with little evidence base, and having more in common with religious practices). \n        Some such categorization, with selective recommendations, would have made \n        the Report vastly more useful than it is with its broad definition and \n        all-encompassing recommendations.</p>\n      <h2><a name=\"BasisforEvaluatingCAM\"></a>Basis for Evaluating CAM</h2>\n      <p>One of the strengths of the Report is its very clear articulation of \n        the importance of evidence-based medicine. For example, the Report states: \n        &#x93;The Commission&#x92;s position is that the same high standards of \n        quality, rigor, and ethics must be met in both CAM and conventional medical \n        research, research training, publication of research results in scientific \n        and medical journals, presentations at research conferences, and review \n        of products and devices.&#x94; </p>\n      <p>Human health and illness are complicated phenomena. When people try a \n        therapy, improvements may be due to the therapy, to some other factor \n        in their lives, to the natural course of the illness, or to the placebo \n        effect.<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#4\">4</a></sup> The latter is a complicated set of factors that includes \n        the interaction between the healthcare professional and the patient, the \n        patient&#x92;s confidence and expectations, and the power of suggestion. \n        Just because someone feels better after using a therapy or remedy does \n        not mean the intervention caused those changes.</p>\n      <p>Because of these complexities, evidence-based medicine is an approach \n        to medical decision-making that relies on the highest quality objective \n        research available. Medical research studies are designed in several different \n        ways, leading to evidence of differing quality. In keeping with evidence-based \n        medicine, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine \n        (NCCAM) prioritizes the types of studies in the following order:<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#5\">5</a></sup></p>\n      <ol type=\"i\">\n        <li> \n          <p>Large randomized clinical trials</p>\n        </li><li> \n          <p>Small randomized clinical trials</p>\n        </li><li> \n          <p>Uncontrolled trials</p>\n        </li><li> \n          <p>Observational studies</p>\n        </li><li> \n          <p>Case studies</p>\n        </li><li> \n          <p>Anecdotes</p>\n      </li></ol>\n      <p>Randomized controlled trials (RCT) offer the best form of evidence for \n        determining whether or not an intervention actually caused the observed \n        changes. Subjects are randomly divided into at least two groups. One group \n        receives the therapy and the other receives a placebo. The subjects in \n        both groups should not know which intervention they are receiving, and \n        neither should the researchers who are interacting with the subjects (called \n        a double-blind study). The results should be analyzed statistically to \n        ensure that the two groups were similar, that enough people were enrolled \n        in the study, and that the differences observed are significant (not just \n        due to random variation). If all these criteria are met, the differences \n        will be reported as &#x91;statistically significant.&#x92;</p>\n      <p>Anecdotes or testimonials are the least useful reports in helping to \n        understand the cause of any changes. These are the stories and reports \n        we all hear of where someone tried a remedy and felt much better afterwards. \n        These reports have a role to play in medicine, but they do not demonstrate \n        what caused any reported improvements. Their major limitation is that \n        they do not control for the many changes that could have occurred in someone&#x92;s \n        life. </p>\n      <p>For example, if we feel we are getting a cold, we may cut back on activities, \n        try to get some extra sleep, and take some over-the-counter cold medications. \n        Someone may tell us they always take high doses of vitamin C when they \n        get a cold, and we decide to give it a try. If we start to feel better \n        shortly after taking the vitamin C, we as humans seem to have a psychological \n        predisposition to associate our most recent change with the improvements \n        we experience. We may then believe that vitamin C cured our cold. In reality, \n        however, we made a number of changes, any and all of which could have \n        contributed to our improvement. In addition, colds are going to go away \n        after a few days no matter what we do. Testimonials are not reliable. \n        In addition, with this example, several large RCTs have found that vitamin \n        C may improve cold symptoms by about ten percent, but it doesn&#x92;t \n        cure or prevent the common cold.<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#6\">6</a></sup></p>\n      <p>The WHCCAMP Report accepts this order of priority in weighing the evidence \n        for and against a remedy or therapy. &#x93;Decisions on regulating the \n        use of and reimbursement for CAM therapies should be based on published \n        evidence of safety (including toxicity, side effects, and adverse interactions), \n        clinical efficacy, general effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit \n        analyses rather than on traditional use, anecdotal reports, consumer interest, \n        and market demand.&#x94; The Report makes it clear that &#x93;use and \n        interest in CAM is not an indication that these practices are effective.&#x94;</p>\n      <p>There is not a conventional way to evaluate medicines and an alternative \n        way to evaluate medicines. In fact, many of the central features of modern \n        medical research were developed while studying what would today be viewed \n        as CAM therapies.<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#4\">4</a></sup> The Report is to be commended for insisting \n        on the highest quality evidence for CAM therapies. If such evidence exists \n        to support the use of a therapy, it should persuade those who may initially \n        be more skeptical of that therapy&#x92;s value. If those sorts of studies \n        do not exist for a therapy for which much anecdotal evidence of effectiveness \n        exists, the first priority would be to develop high-quality evidence.</p>\n      <h2><a name=\"ProvisionofInformation\"></a>Provision of Information</h2>\n      <p>Given the importance that the Report places on evidence-based medicine, \n        it then calls for the use of this approach in the provision of CAM information \n        to the public. The Report states that CAM must be shown to be safe and \n        effective before being promoted, provided, or paid for. However, too often \n        this does not happen.</p>\n      <p>The Report states: &#x93;To ensure public safety in the continually evolving \n        area of CAM, accurate information must be available so that people can \n        make informed choices. This includes choosing the most appropriate type \n        of practitioner, deciding what type of approach can benefit certain conditions, \n        ascertaining the ingredients in a product (such as a dietary supplement), \n        and determining whether ingredients are safe and can assist in maintaining \n        health. Yet far too often information to help make these choices is nonexistent, \n        inaccurate, or difficult to find.&#x94; </p>\n      <p>The Internet is increasingly being used by the public as an educational \n        tool on healthcare matters. Yet the quality and accuracy of the Internet \n        information on CAM is highly questionable. &#x93;People may be making \n        life-and-death decisions based on information from the Internet that may \n        be misleading, incomplete, or inaccurate. This is particularly true in \n        the case of CAM, for which a significant amount of evidence-based material \n        is not yet available.&#x94; </p>\n      <p>The Commissioners state that &#x93;most CAM modalities have not yet been \n        proven to be safe and effective&#x94; and therefore they &#x93;believe \n        that it is premature to advocate the wide implementation and reimbursement \n        of CAM modalities that are yet unproven.&#x94; At this point, the Report \n        is in agreement with those who advocate an evidence-based approach to \n        CAM.</p>\n      <p>However, the Report also reveals a high level of confidence that much \n        within CAM will prove to be safe and effective. &#x93;Although most CAM \n        modalities have not yet been proven to be safe and effective, it is likely \n        that some of them eventually will be proven to be safe and effective, \n        whereas others will not.&#x94; Having made this prediction in the Introduction, \n        and affirmed the general lack of high-quality evidence for CAM throughout \n        the Report, Chapter 7 is contradictory: &#x93;A growing body of evidence \n        shows that many CAM interventions are effective in treating or helping \n        to treat a range of health conditions.&#x94; </p>\n      <p>These contradictory statements are the clearest examples of a level of \n        internal inconsistency regarding evidence-based medicine found throughout \n        the Report. On the one hand, the Report calls for adherence to the principles \n        on evidence-based medicine and acknowledges that much of CAM does not \n        have this level of support. On the other hand, the Report frequently speaks \n        of CAM as if it had evidence-based support and makes recommendations assuming \n        CAM does or soon will have this sort of support. The Commissioners who \n        wrote the dissenting letter point out that the Commission&#x92;s recommendations \n        &#x93;do not appropriately acknowledge the limitations of unproven and \n        unvalidated &#x91;CAM&#x92; interventions or adequately address the minimization \n        of risk.&#x94; They elaborate that, &#x93;While the Report acknowledges \n        that much of what is considered &#x91;CAM&#x92; has not been shown to \n        be safe and effective, a presumption exists that complementary and alternative \n        medicine will be found to be beneficial.&#x94;</p>\n      <p>The Report does claim that, &#x93;Adequate evidence as to safety and \n        efficacy already exist for considering coverage of some CAM interventions.&#x94; \n        But they do not elaborate on which interventions they include here, or \n        for which indications. The specific interventions they cite as having \n        been demonstrated to be safe and effective are exercise, nutrition, and \n        stress management. Yet the effectiveness of these interventions has been \n        established within conventional medicine with its on-going emphasis on \n        evidence-based research to support practices. In fact, some of the CAM \n        recommendations made within these areas (such as diets for curing cancer \n        and some fad diets) contradict the recommendations of evidence-based approaches \n        to these same interventions. This raises once again the Report&#x92;s \n        overriding problem in lacking definitional clarity as to what precisely \n        constitutes CAM.</p>\n      <p>Not only is there a contradictory emphasis within the Report, but the \n        principles of evidence-based medicine endorsed by the Report are not used \n        when it makes recommendations about particular CAM therapies. The Report \n        includes a chapter on wellness and health promotion. This section is plagued \n        by a lack of clarity, including the statement, &#x93;Helping people achieve \n        a healthy, meaningful, and long life is the fundamental purpose of all \n        health care systems.&#x94; Such broad goals for any healthcare system \n        would generate huge problems. How is the healthcare system supposed to \n        help people achieve a meaningful life? Who will define what makes life \n        meaningful? This brings healthcare into the realm of promoting philosophical \n        or religious teachings that encourage a person to find meaning in life. \n        This aspect of the Report will be further explored later in the section \n        on spirituality.</p>\n      <p>Returning to issues related to the use of evidence, the Report states \n        that, &#x93;CAM practices such as acupuncture, biofeedback, yoga, massage, \n        and tai chi, as well as certain nutritional and stress reduction practices, \n        may be useful in contributing to the achievement of the nation&#x92;s \n        health goals and objectives.&#x94; </p>\n      <p>The Report then recommends that various programs be piloted to examine \n        the benefits of CAM in schools, workplaces, and federal programs. The \n        Report proclaims with great confidence, &#x93;CAM principles and practices \n        may be useful not only in preventing some of these diseases and conditions, \n        but also in enhancing recovery and preventing further illness.&#x94; But \n        how the Report supports these claims does not follow the evidence-based \n        principles the Report itself endorses.</p>\n      <p>For example, the Report simply states that, &#x93;A significant portion \n        of the adult population takes supplements and herbs to maintain health.&#x94; \n        This claim was not balanced against the Report&#x92;s earlier statement \n        that popular use does not support effectiveness or safety. </p>\n      <p>The Report then selected one or two studies with positive results for \n        the use of a particular CAM intervention. Listing one positive study after \n        another (for different interventions) gives the impression of a significant \n        body of evidence supporting CAM. However, selectively picking and listing \n        positive studies is not in keeping with evidence-based medicine. One or \n        two positive studies can be found for almost any intervention. What is \n        needed is a systematic review of the literature to get an objective overview \n        of the research findings. For example, yoga was mentioned as an intervention \n        that might contribute to people&#x92;s health through reducing stress \n        levels. The Report stated, &#x93;Studies have shown that stress reduction \n        techniques such as yoga and meditation are beneficial.&#x94; While that \n        may be true, other studies do not support this conclusion. A controlled \n        study found that yoga was no more effective in reducing stress than sitting \n        and relaxing as measured by blood pressure levels.<sup>7</sup> Such selective \n        use of the literature is inappropriate, although a common problem in reviews \n        of CAM interventions.<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#8\">8</a></sup> </p>\n      <p>The Report also bolstered the appearance of evidence in support of CAM \n        by citing studies of questionable relevance. For example, a study on the \n        benefits of wearing seat belts was mentioned. In another place the Report \n        cited a workplace study that found reduced incidences of illness in employees \n        after the introduction of lifestyle wellness programs. The Report did \n        not describe the programs, which focused on interventions like safety \n        classes, training of supervisors, and the evaluation of smoking policies \n        and the food available in cafeterias.<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#9\">9</a></sup> It is difficult to see \n        how any study of these sorts of interventions provides support for CAM. \n        This is a practical demonstration of the types of problems that arise \n        when a clear and concise definition of CAM is not used.</p>\n      <p>Another example of how the Report did not abide by evidence-based principles \n        is provided by its approach to homeopathy. Although never examined in \n        any detail in the Report, numerous references were made to homeopathy \n        as a popular example of CAM. The Report mentions that homeopathy was listed \n        among the five CAM therapies most commonly believed by conventional physicians \n        to be effective. </p>\n      <p>Yet no mention was made of the fact that systematic reviews consistently \n        find that evidence for the effectiveness of homeopathy is, at best, very \n        weak. The most recent review was carried out by the British National Health \n        Service (NHS) Centre for Reviews and Dissemination.<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#10\">10</a></sup> Homeopathy \n        remains very popular in Britain, in part because of its use by the Royal \n        Family, and can be paid for by the NHS. The NHS review noted than many \n        of the 200-plus studies of homeopathy, and some earlier systematic reviews, \n        were very poorly designed and carried out. The review concluded that there \n        is insufficient evidence to recommend homeopathy as a treatment for any \n        specific condition.</p>\n      <p>No indication of this situation is given in the WHCCAMP Report when it \n        includes homeopathy along with all other CAM modalities. Some sort of \n        differentiation of specific CAM therapies would have been expected in \n        the Report, such as the categorization system suggested earlier.<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#4\">4</a></sup> \n        Without this, the Report&#x92;s many calls for further funding and research \n        of CAM would be assumed to include examination of homeopathy. Yet here \n        is one CAM intervention that has been repeatedly studied and a consensus \n        within evidence-based medicine holds that homeopathy fails the established \n        criteria by which a therapy is viewed as an effective intervention. </p>\n      <p>That being the case, homeopathy should be placed very low on the priority \n        list of interventions to be promoted or funded. One of the principles \n        of evidence-based medicine is that when a therapy is demonstrated to be \n        ineffective or unsafe, practitioners will adjust their practice in accordance \n        with that evidence. This example raises serious questions about how willing \n        proponents would be to implement the findings of evidence-based medicine \n        when it doesn&#x92;t support a therapy&#x92;s effectiveness or safety. \n      </p>\n      <h2><a name=\"ResearchPriorities\"></a>Research Priorities</h2>\n      <p>The problem with lack of definitional clarity in the Report has been \n        mentioned several times. A place where this limitation becomes glaringly \n        obvious is regarding the priorities that must be set by public policy \n        in addressing CAM. In spite of admitting that much within CAM is unproven, \n        either in effectiveness or safety, the Report calls for significant investments \n        in CAM research. </p>\n      <p>However, research funds are limited. When agencies make decisions about \n        which proposals to fund, they need to abide by fair guidelines. Proposals \n        for CAM therapies must be evaluated against all other proposals and funding \n        distributed on merit, not ideology. As the two Commissioners wrote in \n        the dissenting letter, &#x93;Asking for more research money to investigate \n        an approach, practice or product simply because it is &#x91;CAM&#x92; \n        is an ideological, not evidence-based approach to science.&#x94; Once \n        again, the Report fails to uphold the very principles it calls on others \n        to implement regarding CAM.</p>\n      <p>Funding agencies need guidelines by which they can decide which proposals \n        to fund, and this Report provided no help in developing these guidelines. \n        The Report made recommendations for a huge amount of research, but they \n        neither explained why CAM therapies should be pursued in preference to \n        conventional therapies, nor which CAM therapies should be prioritized \n        for research.</p>\n      <p>One such guideline would be to begin with a thorough review of previously \n        conducted research. An example of the importance of this was already given \n        with homeopathy. The fact that so much evidence exists that homeopathy \n        is no more effective than placebo must be used to give homeopathy a lower \n        research priority than some other therapy with promising preliminary research \n        results.</p>\n      <p>A second criterion by which research priorities could be set is by evaluating \n        the plausibility of the therapy against well-known scientific observations. \n        For example, the NHS homeopathy review points out that &#x93;given the \n        absence of a plausible mechanism of action, it has been argued that the \n        existing evidence base represents little more than a series of placebo \n        versus placebo trials.&#x94;<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#10\">10</a></sup> </p>\n      <p>In the categorization scheme suggested earlier, the scientifically implausible \n        basis for homeopathy would move it into the scientifically questionable \n        category, not the unproven one. If a CAM therapy has little evidence of \n        effectiveness, and is based on scientifically questionable principles \n        that contradict well-established scientific principles, that proposal \n        should receive a low priority.</p>\n      <p>In spite of a central aspect of the Commission&#x92;s mission being to \n        lead coordination of CAM research, the Report provided no guidance here, \n        other than a general call to fund CAM. </p>\n      <h2><a name=\"EducationalPriorities\"></a>Educational Priorities</h2>\n      <p>The Report&#x92;s recommendations on CAM education are similarly given \n        without guidelines for selection. No priorities are established for choosing \n        the CAM therapies to be taught in conventional medical schools, included \n        in medical conferences or written about in journals. The medical school \n        curriculum is already over-flowing. Physicians have so much to learn, \n        priorities must be established that facilitate selection of curricular \n        material. </p>\n      <p>The Report calls for the inclusion of CAM practitioners on medical faculties \n        and in medical conferences, journals, and review boards. However, this \n        should only happen after the CAM practices and practitioners have shown \n        themselves to be qualified by evidence-based guidelines. The Report gives \n        little guidance on how CAM practitioners should be chosen and validated. \n        As with research and the therapies themselves, there is an assumption \n        that CAM practitioners should be included within conventional medical \n        schools without assistance in determining whom to include.</p>\n      <p>The Report does address an existing problem in the teaching of CAM in \n        conventional medicine. Referring to CAM courses in conventional medical \n        schools, it notes that, &#x93;While many CAM courses are taught from either \n        an advocacy or neutral view, all CAM courses should be taught critically.&#x94; \n        This tendency is apparent throughout CAM, and is even evident in the Report \n        itself. This is one reason why the Commission itself should have been \n        composed of a broad spectrum of medical practitioners, not just those \n        who were primarily proponents of CAM. </p>\n      <p>The Report sets out excellent general criteria by which CAM should be \n        taught: &#x93;CAM taught in the context of conventional medical education \n        should be evidence-based.&#x94; Given the Report&#x92;s own admission \n        that very little in CAM rises to this standard, medical schools would \n        seem justified in not spending large amounts of time or resources on CAM. \n        Yet the Report calls for significant investment in the teaching of CAM \n        in conventional medical schools and to physicians in continuing education. \n      </p>\n      <p>At the same time, the Report calls for the inclusion of conventional \n        medical training within the training programs of CAM practitioners. The \n        Report&#x92;s hope seems to be that CAM practitioners will become primary \n        care providers in a future healthcare system. However, given the completely \n        different nature of the training of physicians and even other conventional \n        healthcare professionals, it seems irresponsible to add some coursework \n        to a CAM practitioner&#x92;s training and hope to turn out adequately \n        trained primary care providers. As the dissenting letter from two of the \n        Commissioners states, &#x93;Efforts to equate their [CAM practitioners] \n        degree of training, or the scientific basis of their practice, with that \n        of the designated primary care specialties puts the public at risk of \n        receiving unvalidated and non-evidence based primary care.&#x94;</p>\n      <h2><a name=\"InclusionofSpiritualitywithinCAM\"></a>Inclusion of Spirituality \n        within CAM</h2>\n      <p>One of the distinctive characteristics of CAM that the Report identifies \n        is concern for spirituality. The inclusion of one&#x92;s worldview as \n        a form of CAM represents a significant broadening of the scope of medicine. \n        This aspect of the Report is of great concern to an organization like \n        the Christian Medical Association. Many people have entered the healthcare \n        profession because of religious and spiritual beliefs about the importance \n        of helping other people. Religion and spirituality strongly influence \n        a person&#x92;s worldview and lifestyle. Decisions based on religious \n        and spiritual beliefs therefore influence a person&#x92;s health. </p>\n      <p>Acknowledging the importance of religion and spirituality for health \n        and healing is one thing. Viewing spirituality as part of CAM is something \n        else. The dissenting letter from two of the Commissioners disagrees with \n        the designation of spirituality as CAM. &#x93;When spirituality is so \n        designated, &#x91;CAM&#x92; prevalence grows dramatically. The truth is \n        that spirituality transcends any arbitrary designation of conventional \n        and non-conventional medicine and cannot be claimed by any particular \n        group.&#x94; </p>\n      <p>Medicine and religion have been intertwined throughout history. Modern \n        medicine is unique in being a secular enterprise. It has sometimes made \n        itself excessively &#x91;secular&#x92; by refusing to even acknowledge \n        spirituality. But the existence of hospital chaplains is one reminder \n        that conventional medicine does see a place for spirituality. Conventional \n        medicine has not usually provided spiritual care. Physicians and caregivers \n        should see the importance of recognizing patients&#x92; spiritual needs \n        and ensure that, if they are not trained or experienced in providing spiritual \n        care, these needs are addressed by someone qualified to do so.</p>\n      <p>Many within CAM seek to reintroduce spirituality into modern healthcare. \n        The inclusion of spiritual teaching along with CAM therapies is commonly \n        viewed as important to address a person&#x92;s holistic needs. However, \n        this raises a number of ethical problems that are rarely addressed by \n        CAM practitioners, and are not discussed in the WHCCAMP Report.</p>\n      <p>The Report describes spirituality relatively infrequently, and primarily \n        raises it in the chapter on wellness. However, as with other crucial aspects \n        of the Report, the term is not defined. This would have been especially \n        important given the deeply personal nature of a person&#x92;s spirituality \n        and how it frequently borders on one&#x92;s religious beliefs.</p>\n      <p>An example of how this is relevant is with the concerns that some raise \n        about whether certain CAM therapies are of potentially harmful spiritual \n        origins or are covertly religious. If so, they raise serious concerns \n        about how they ought to be offered to patients, and whether or not federal \n        funding of some of these practices might interfere with the principles \n        of separation of church and state.</p>\n      <p>The Report gives examples of several CAM wellness programs that it would \n        welcome seeing in hospitals, community centers, public schools, and workplaces. \n        The Report selects positive studies of several stress-reducing therapies \n        and wellness promoting therapies such as yoga, tai chi, and meditation. \n        Yet the Report makes no mention of the spiritual conflicts that some people \n        have with these therapies. </p>\n      <p>For example, yoga is described as being able to contribute to the general \n        health of the nation, and children using yoga are said to have increased \n        concentration, reduced impulsive behavior, and increased self-esteem.<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#11\">11</a></sup> \n        Yet no mention is made of the controversy surrounding the spiritual roots \n        of yoga, a term that literally means &#x93;union.&#x94;<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#4\">4</a></sup> &#x93;Yoga \n        practices yoke&#x97;or unite&#x97;the self to God. . . Yoga is a means \n        towards realizing God, a spiritual, mystical path toward higher consciousness.&#x94;<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#12\">12</a></sup> \n        Although the spiritual roots of yoga are often ignored in America, Hindu \n        practitioners claim this strips yoga of its true value. <i>Yoga Journal</i>, \n        a popular publication for yoga enthusiasts, recently devoted its cover \n        story to the question of whether or not yoga is religious.<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#13\">13</a></sup> \n        The journal acknowledged that in the eyes of many devout Christians, Jews, \n        and Muslims, yoga would be offensive and incompatible with their religious \n        beliefs. </p>\n      <p>Whatever one&#x92;s perspective on this issue, this sort of controversy \n        should be acknowledged and discussed in a public policy document such \n        as the WHCCAMP Report. The Report&#x92;s endorsement of these types of \n        therapies carries with it an obligation to consider the potential conflicts \n        that these therapies generate. </p>\n      <p>The Report similarly suggested that meditation should be considered a \n        legitimate option within CAM. Yet the Report does not define what it means \n        by meditation, which can be anything from resting one&#x92;s eyes to transporting \n        oneself into a spiritual plane to contact spiritual beings.<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#4\">4</a></sup> \n        A Federal Court ruling on Transcendental Meditation is directly applicable \n        here, and has been used to establish that an employer cannot require employees \n        to practice or attend programs they deem religious in nature. The practices \n        listed include meditation, yoga, guided visualization, self-hypnosis, \n        therapeutic touch, biofeedback, walking on fire, and inducing altered \n        states of consciousness.<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#14\">14</a></sup> Many of these are now viewed as \n        forms of CAM. Although proponents of these CAM therapies may claim they \n        are not religious, the Federal Court decision on Transcendental Meditation \n        ruled that, &#x93;the subjective characterizations by individuals of teachings \n        as religious or not religious in their systems of categorization cannot \n        be determinative of whether or not the teachings are religious within \n        the meaning of the first amendment.&#x94;<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#15\">15</a></sup> For these reasons, \n        careful deliberation is needed on the ethics and legality of introducing \n        religious or spiritually-based CAM into schools, places of employment, \n        and public health facilities. The Report did not acknowledge the need \n        for such deliberations, which were mentioned in the two Commissioners&#x92; \n        dissenting letter.</p>\n      <p>More generally, the view that spirituality is a therapy of any sort is \n        offensive to some people. It promotes a view of spirituality as a means \n        towards an end, usually good health or a longer life. However, many spiritual \n        and religious traditions view spirituality as an important end in itself. \n        For them, inclusion of spirituality as a CAM therapy distorts the very \n        essence of what spirituality or religion is all about.</p>\n      <p>Concerns have also been raised about whether it is appropriate for medicine \n        to include the provision of spiritual care.<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#16\">16</a></sup> Claims are made \n        that healthcare professionals do not have the training in spiritual care. \n        Some claim spirituality should be viewed like a person&#x92;s marital \n        or financial status: these have health implications, but should not be \n        regarded as within the proper domain of medicine. </p>\n      <p>The relationship between physician and patient is not one in which both \n        are on equal footing. The patient is often weak and vulnerable, and in \n        many ways wants to do what the physician desires. Religious and spiritual \n        topics must be raised with great care. Those in positions of power must \n        be concerned not to pressure those who are vulnerable into accepting their \n        beliefs and personal practices. On the other hand, these concerns should \n        not lead healthcare professionals to ignore or dismiss spiritual concerns.</p>\n      <p>Besides, there is significant evidence-based literature documenting the \n        health benefits of addressing spiritual issues.<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#17\">17</a></sup> Other studies \n        show that patients want their primary care physicians to discuss spiritual \n        issues with them. What is needed is adequate training so that spiritual \n        care can be given ethically and effectively.</p>\n      <p>Therefore, guidelines are needed to help healthcare professionals raise \n        and respond to spiritual issues in ethically appropriate and sensitive \n        ways. Informed consent is central to good medicine, and should apply here \n        too. Patients should be asked for their permission to address spiritual \n        issues. They should be told of the spiritual basis of any practices or \n        guidance being offered. Those offering spiritual practices, or suggesting \n        that certain spiritual beliefs are beneficial, should be knowledgeable \n        of the evidence supporting those claims. Further, careful dialogue is \n        needed on how spirituality can and should be incorporated into modern \n        healthcare.</p>\n      <p>A spiritual or religious practice should not be introduced to patients \n        as if it was just another therapy or remedy. People have reported finding \n        out about the spiritual roots of a CAM therapy long after it had been \n        provided. Such covert promotion of spirituality must be addressed. The \n        WHCCAMP Report missed an opportunity to encourage this discussion by simply \n        viewing spirituality as another CAM therapy.</p>\n      <h2><a name=\"IssuesofJustice\"></a>Issues of Justice</h2>\n      <p>The Report claims that CAM might effectively address inequities currently \n        within the US healthcare system. Some people do not have access to conventional \n        medicine, and some do not have access to CAM. The Report hopes that CAM: \n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li> \n          <p>may provide benefits to vulnerable populations who do not have adequate \n            access to conventional medicine,</p>\n        </li><li> \n          <p>may lower healthcare costs and thereby improve access to conventional \n            medicine, and</p>\n        </li><li> \n          <p>help solve problems of equity and quality.</p>\n      </li></ul>\n      <p>The Report gives little support for its optimism </p>\n      <p>in these areas. Given the complexity of the healthcare system, and the \n        reasons for its current inequalities, adding the provision of CAM would \n        seem to be an unlikely solution. Yet the Report states, &#x93;While it \n        is too early to judge the effectiveness of CAM in addressing their health \n        care needs, CAM nonetheless offers the possibility of a new paradigm of \n        integrated health care that could affect the affordability, accessibility, \n        and delivery of health care services for millions of Americans.&#x94;</p>\n      <p>Given the lack of information on CAM&#x92;s effectiveness and safety, \n        such sweeping optimism seems unwarranted. The first priority should be \n        to help poor and vulnerable populations gain access to what has already \n        been demonstrated to be safe and effective. The Report&#x92;s suggestion \n        that providing CAM first could alleviate some problems runs the risk of \n        supporting an unjust two-tier healthcare system. For those who can afford \n        effective healthcare, conventional medicine will be provided. For those \n        who are vulnerable and poor, unproven CAM will be provided. </p>\n      <p>The Report&#x92;s recommendations also assume that CAM will be more cost-effective \n        than conventional medicine. This has not been demonstrated, and there \n        is some evidence that CAM can be more expensive. For example, the costs \n        of caring for acute low back pain were compared between patients who saw \n        chiropractors, primary care physicians, and orthopedic surgeons.<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#18\">18</a></sup> \n        The time to recovery was essentially the same for all three forms of care. \n        The lowest mean cost per episode was provided by the primary care physicians. \n        The cost of care from chiropractors and orthopedic surgeons was about \n        the same, and much more than that from primary care providers. Clearly, \n        what is needed before any recommendations can be made about what should \n        or should not be promoted, and what might help the healthcare system, \n        is research on the effectiveness, safety, and costs of selected CAM therapies.</p>\n      <h2><a name=\"SafetyIssues\"></a>Safety Issues</h2>\n      <p>The lack of information on the safety, effectiveness, and costs of CAM \n        was acknowledged throughout the Report. Statements were frequently made \n        about the importance of evidence-based practice to determine whether or \n        not specific CAM therapies were safe. But at the same time, calls were \n        repeatedly made for increased funding of CAM research, increased coverage \n        of CAM by insurance, and increased use of CAM in wellness programs. The \n        enthusiasm with which these recommendations were made suggests that public \n        safety was not given the priority it deserves. Issues of safety must be \n        addressed before widespread implementation of CAM therapies. </p>\n      <p>Safety of dietary supplements was one area where the Report had several \n        helpful suggestions to improve the current situation. Given the poor quality \n        of many herbal products on the US market today, steps are urgently needed \n        in this area. However, safety must also be evaluated with all CAM therapies. \n        Meditation was mentioned as a form of therapy that might be beneficial. \n        No mention was made of the several published reports of adverse effects \n        from meditation.<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#19\">19</a>,<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#20\">20</a></sup> Among the spiritual therapies, practices \n        based on &#x91;life energy&#x92; or &#x91;qi&#x92; have been associated \n        with psychological problems.<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#21\">21</a></sup> If CAM is to promote the idea \n        of holistic health, then the possibility of &#x93;holistic harm&#x94; \n        must also be investigated.<sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/whitehouse_cam.htm#22\">22</a></sup> </p>\n      <h2><a name=\"Conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n      <p>The WHCCAMP Report strongly endorses the principles of evidence-based \n        medicine. It makes it clear that the way forward for CAM is to address \n        the important issues of effectiveness and safety. The most reliable way \n        to evaluate any therapy or remedy, whether conventional or alternative, \n        is through the research methods developed over the last century. These \n        sorts of studies allow the identification of therapies and remedies that \n        have the ability to promote human health and cure illness.</p>\n      <p>While the Report endorses evidence-based medicine, it shows significant \n        weaknesses in the Commission&#x92;s willingness to implement this approach. \n        Significant failings were pointed out here in the way the Report endorses \n        therapies, or at least suggests their strong likelihood for benefits. \n        Positive studies were selectively cited rather than using the results \n        of systematic reviews of the therapies. </p>\n      <p>These, and other factors, gave the Report a degree of optimism regarding \n        CAM that the evidence currently does not support. The Report itself states \n        that much of CAM does not have the studies to support its effectiveness \n        or safety. Therefore, the primary recommendations of the Report should \n        have been to call for the collecting or generating of the needed evidence, \n        and implementing evidence-based practice. </p>\n      <p>Given the vast array of therapies within CAM, and the limited funds available \n        for all healthcare research, the Report should have developed ways to \n        prioritize research funding. Calls for massive funding of CAM research \n        in general need to be limited and orderly. A prioritizing scheme would \n        have benefited those interested in funding the studies most likely to \n        produce patient benefit.</p>\n      <p>While establishing an excellent basis upon which CAM might move forward, \n        the Report leap-frogs beyond the obvious step of collecting evidence to \n        steps that belong much further down the road. The tone of the Report is \n        one in which sweeping changes are called for, everything from adding courses \n        in CAM to medical schools, provision of CAM within federal programs, and \n        coverage of CAM by insurance programs. Such recommendations are premature \n        until a sufficient foundation of evidence-based reviews becomes available \n        on what works, what is safe, and what is affordable.</p>\n      <p>The inclusion of spirituality within CAM is of particular concern. Spiritual \n        concerns are important to patients when they are ill. These questions \n        should be addressed by healthcare professionals. The forms of spirituality \n        frequently encountered within CAM are often those that claim to be non-religious. \n        This is a controversial claim to make and support. What should be acknowledged \n        is that spiritual practices have the potential to be offensive to some \n        patients, especially if they are not informed ahead of time of the spiritual \n        roots or religiousness of a practice. Therefore, patients should be told \n        clearly of the nature of any spiritual teachings that may underlie a CAM \n        therapy. The Report missed an important opportunity to address these issues \n        by failing to even acknowledge them. </p>\n      <p>The Report provides a welcome endorsement of the importance of evidence-based \n        medicine in evaluations of CAM. However, the Report arrived at many of \n        its other recommendations in ways that are not supported by evidence-based \n        medicine. The Report also failed to address some of the significant issues \n        that need to be addressed before CAM should be promoted within the US \n        healthcare system.</p>\n      <p>&#x97;<i><b>D&#xF3;nal P.

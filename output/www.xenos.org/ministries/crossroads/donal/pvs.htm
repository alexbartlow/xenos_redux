This journal is a publication of the<a href=\"http://www.epsociety.org/journal.htm\"> \n        Evangelical Philosophical Society</a>.} </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Modern medicine has provided \n        people with many great benefits, but it has also forced people to make \n        difficult ethical decisions. One of the hardest of these is to let a loved \n        one die when medical technology could keep him or her alive. People must \n        now decide if and when they would want certain treatments withheld or \n        withdrawn from themselves or others. The ethical issues involved raise \n        questions about autonomy, quality of life, appropriate use of resources, \n        the wishes of family members, professional responsibilities, and many \n        more. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The withdrawing of food \n        and fluids from patients in persistent vegetative state (PVS) is one of \n        these tragic situations. This term was first coined in 1972, and the condition \n        has since been the subject of much ethical and legal debate.<sup><a name=\"Ref1\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note1\">[1]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        The tragic cases of Karen Ann Quinlan and Nancy Cruzan brought this debate \n        into full public view.<sup><a name=\"Ref2\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note2\">[2]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        These patients do not seem to be conscious, nor capable of communication. \n        They seem to be unaware of both their environment and themselves. They \n        depend on others to provide for all their needs, which brings in financial \n        concerns. Some will live for years in this condition, provided they are \n        given adequate nutrition and hydration. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Many find it agonizing to \n        watch anyone, particularly a loved one, languish in this condition with \n        little hope for recovery. For this reason, allowing PVS patients to die \n        can seem very merciful. So, the ethical question arises: should we withdraw \n        artificially administered food and fluids from these patients and allow \n        them die? </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Many issues are raised by \n        this difficult question.<sup><a name=\"Ref3\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note3\">[3]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        For some, autonomy is the central issue. If we can show that this particular \n        patient would not want to live in such a condition, food and fluids should \n        be withdrawn and the patient allowed to die. For others, the issue is \n        whether artificially administered food and fluids should be considered \n        ordinary care or extraordinary care. Ordinary care is generally viewed \n        as obligatory. Some view food and fluids, even those artificially administered, \n        as ordinary because they are basic to survival, and symbolic of care and \n        comfort. Others view artificially administered food and fluids as extraordinary \n        because they are medical technologies and, in PVS, do not heal or lead \n        to improvement in the patient's status. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Others view these patients' \n        quality of life as so poor, they see no obligation to continue feeding \n        and hydration. Some view sustaining these patients lives as unethical \n        because of its expense. Still others center the debate on whether or not \n        PVS patients are persons. If not, they see no obligation to continue providing \n        food and fluids. Others propose resolving this dilemma by creating new \n        criteria for determining when death occurs.<sup><a name=\"Ref4\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note4\">[4]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        <i>If</i> PVS patients are actually dead, there should be little argument \n        over withholding or withdrawing their food and fluids. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Obviously, the variety of \n        issues and perspectives involved lead to different conclusions. Christian \n        authors have not given widespread attention to this issue. However, some \n        evangelical writers have supported one distinctively Christian position. \n        They claim that PVS patients no longer bear the image of God and therefore \n        need not be fed or hydrated.<sup><a name=\"Ref5\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note5\">[5]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        Our paper will examine and critique this argument that PVS patients are \n        \"theologically\" dead. In contrast, we will argue that the \"image \n        of God\" concept should lead us to continue providing PVS patients \n        with artificially administered food and fluids. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;This paper will address \n        only the withdrawal of food and fluids from PVS patients without other \n        complicating conditions. Patients in PVS are susceptible to other conditions \n        like pneumonia, heart failure, or cancer. Care-givers and family must \n        make tough decisions every time a medical intervention is considered. \n        Similar decisions must be made concerning the most appropriate medical \n        treatment for any profoundly ill patient. However, these complicating \n        conditions bring new factors into the discussion which we will not directly \n        consider here. However, our conclusions will have strong implications \n        for how we respond to these other situations. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The answer to this more \n        limited question has profound implications beyond PVS. The end stages \n        of diseases like Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's sometimes \n        leave patients in PVS. If we need not feed or hydrate them when they reach \n        that stage, will this influence how we care for them earlier? How will \n        people know when to start treating them as PVS patients? If we do not \n        feed or hydrate these patients, who would otherwise continue to live, \n        will this affect our attitudes toward other profoundly disabled persons? \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Another group of patients \n        in PVS are anencephalic newborns.<sup><a name=\"Ref6\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note6\">[6]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        In a recent reversal of its policy, the American Medical Association now \n        views as ethical the removal of organs from these newborns <i>before they \n        die</i>.<sup><a name=\"Ref7\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note7\">[7]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        If these living newborns are appropriate organ donors simply because they \n        are in (what are called \"permanent\") PVS, then some other living \n        humans in PVS are also appropriate organ donors simply because they too \n        are in (permanent) PVS. </p>\n      <p>Before examining the ethical issues, we must first look \n        at some of the relevant medical aspects of PVS. </p>\n      <p><b>Medical Issues </b></p>\n      <p><b>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</b>A \n        review of the medical information concerning PVS was published in 1994 \n        by the Multi-Society Task Force on PVS (MSTF).<sup><a name=\"Ref8\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note8\">[8]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        They estimated that 10,000 to 25,000 adults and 4,000 to 10,000 children \n        live in PVS in the United States.<sup><a name=\"Ref9\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note9\">[9]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        PVS can be caused by acute brain injury (e.g. car accidents or lack of \n        oxygen from a heart attack or near-drowning), chronic degenerative disease \n        (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease), or developmental malformations \n        (e.g. anencephaly).<sup><a name=\"Ref10\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note10\">[10]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        The injury or disease often results in profound damage to, if not complete \n        death of, the cerebral cortex--that region of the brain believed by many \n        to be responsible for all higher, cognitive functioning.<sup><a name=\"Ref11\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note11\">[11]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;According to the MSTF, patients \n        in PVS show no evidence of awareness or thinking, and do not communicate.<sup><a name=\"Ref12\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note12\">[12]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        None of their actions appear purposeful, learned or voluntary. However, \n        the brain stem often functions normally in PVS, allowing a much greater \n        range of activities than seen in related syndromes. Most patients in PVS \n        continue to breathe on their own, circulate blood normally, have periods \n        of waking and sleeping, may move their limbs, smile, shed tears and respond \n        to external stimuli. Some may grunt, groan or scream. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Most patients in PVS cannot \n        chew or swallow food, though some can.<sup><a name=\"Ref13\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note13\">[13]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        Thus arises the ethical dilemma. Some means of artificially administering \n        food and fluids is usually required. Most often a liquid diet is given \n        via a gastrostomy tube which is inserted directly into the stomach. Insertion \n        of this tube requires surgery, but is a relatively low-risk procedure \n        with almost guaranteed effectiveness. \"Indeed, feeding tubes may \n        be unique among all medical technologies in that they almost exceptionlessly \n        deliver on their claims.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref14\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note14\">[14]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;A patient's prognosis must \n        be considered when choosing medical therapies. According to the MSTF, \n        there is no effective treatment available to reverse PVS.<sup><a name=\"Ref15\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note15\">[15]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        The chances of spontaneous recovery depend on the cause of PVS and the \n        age of the patient.<sup><a name=\"Ref16\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note16\">[16]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        There is currently no hope for recovery from degenerative diseases (like \n        Alzeimher's) or developmental abnormalities (like anencephaly). However, \n        when PVS in adults was caused by a traumatic injury (e.g. traffic accident), \n        one year later, 33% had died, 15% remained in PVS and 52% recovered consciousness. \n        Of those who recovered consciousness, 54% had severe disability, 33% had \n        moderate disability and 13% had a good recovery.<sup><a name=\"Ref17\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note17\">[17]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        Among children in PVS dues to traumatic injuries, 62% recovered, 18% of \n        those with a good recovery. When PVS resulted from a nontraumatic injury \n        (e.g. cardiorespiratory arrest), only 15% of adults recovered consciousness, \n        with severe disability being more common. Recovery among children was \n        similar. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;These statistics show that \n        a significant number of people recover from PVS within a year after injury. \n        However, the chances of recovery are much lower after longer periods in \n        PVS. Therefore, the MSTF concluded that PVS should be considered permanent \n        12 months after a traumatic injury, or three months after a nontraumatic \n        injury. However, a few cases of dramatic recovery after extended periods \n        are well documented. One patient recovered after three years in PVS, to \n        the point of being alert and well-oriented.<sup><a name=\"Ref18\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note18\">[18]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;For those who remain in \n        PVS, the average life-expectancy is two to five years.<sup><a name=\"Ref19\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note19\">[19]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        It is unusual for someone to survive more than 10 years, although two \n        patients have survived for 37 and 41 years. However, the MSTF report did \n        not take into account how different types of care affected patients' survival. \n        In fact, there have been no formal studies on how the level of care impacts \n        PVS patients' life expectancy. More aggressive and more caring treatment \n        would probably lengthen survival times.<sup><a name=\"Ref20\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note20\">[20]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;There are some related conditions \n        which must, where possible, be clearly differentiated from PVS.<sup><a name=\"Ref21\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note21\">[21]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        In whole-brain death <i>all</i> brain function has ceased. There are no \n        sleep-wake cycles, and no spontaneous respiration. Today, brain death \n        is synonymous with death. Hence, statements like \"She is brain dead. \n        Why do they not let her die?\" are misleading and reflect a misunderstanding \n        of the terminology. In spite of efforts to change the definition of death, \n        currently someone in PVS is neither dead nor brain dead. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The locked-in syndrome has \n        some similarities to PVS since the person is almost completely paralyzed. \n        However, locked-in patients can often move their eyes purposefully, showing \n        they are conscious and aware of their environment. They can communicate \n        with those around them. Tragically, they are otherwise unable to move. \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The MSTF also distinguished \n        patients in coma from those in PVS. Within two to four weeks, a patient \n        in a coma usually either recovers consciousness, enters PVS, or dies. \n        PVS differs because a patient in a coma does not have sleep-wake cycles, \n        respiration is usually depressed and the duration of coma is much shorter. \n        However, others treat coma and PVS as examples of the same kind of clinical \n        entity because of their prominent similarities, namely apparent lack of \n        consciousness and unarousability by ordinary means.<sup><a name=\"Ref22\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note22\">[22]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        </p>\n      <p><b>Are PVS Patients Unconscious? </b></p>\n      <p><b>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</b>It \n        is commonly assumed that PVS patients are unconscious and therefore unaware \n        of themselves and/or their environments. This belief is central to many \n        arguments favoring withholding or withdrawing food and fluids from PVS \n        patients, including those by Christian authors. The MSTF reiterated this \n        position: \"Patients in a coma are unconscious because they lack both \n        wakefulness and awareness. Patients in a vegetative state are unconscious \n        because, although they are wakeful, they lack awareness.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref23\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note23\">[23]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;But how is this determined? \n        A central problem in the MSTF argument is that it equates the lack of \n        behavioral evidence for consciousness with the absence of consciousness. \n        But consciousness is completely compatible with a lack of evidence for \n        it. However, even when evidence would suggest consciousness, the MSTF \n        quickly disregarded it. There are strongly held beliefs underlying these \n        discussions and evaluations. Unfortunately, they are often not clearly \n        expressed. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;For example, after listing \n        the many functions performed by PVS patients, the MSTF concluded: \"These \n        motor activities may misleadingly suggest purposeful movements, yet these \n        responses have been observed in patients in whom careful study has disclosed \n        no evidence of psychological awareness or the capacity to engage in learned \n        behavior.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref24\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note24\">[24]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        For such a fundamentally important conclusion, it is curious that the \n        MSTF did not reference any of these studies. Regardless, their conclusion \n        actually begs the question. As A. A. Howsepian, MD notes in critically \n        reviewing the MSTF report: \"Of course, <i>if</i> these movements \n        <i>are</i> purposeful, then there <i>is</i> evidence of psychological \n        awareness in some of these patients.\" <sup><a name=\"Ref25\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note25\">[25]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        </p>\n      <p>A recent review of consciousness research presents a very \n        different picture of our current ability to determine the presence or \n        absence of consciousness in patients. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Even if it is <i>in principle</i> \n        possible to invent a 'consciousness monitor', a device that would 'detect' \n        the physical signs of the presence of consciousness in a patient, <i>no \n        such technology is anywhere in sight</i>, as it is not even known what \n        exactly is to be measured. The root of the problem lies deeper than the \n        inadequacy of the technology, or the lack of sufficient data, however. \n        What seems to be critically lacking is also a solid theoretical framework \n        to ground and facilitate the experimental research. For example, there \n        is really <i>no established consensus</i>, even in the medical field, \n        as to what should count as the criteria of consciousness, to demarcate \n        the domain of the conscious from that of the unconscious or the nonconscious<sup><a name=\"Ref26\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note26\">[26]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        (second and third emphases added). </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The MSTF moved well beyond \n        its stated goal of addressing only \"the medical facts\" about \n        PVS.<sup><a name=\"Ref27\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note27\">[27]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        As Howsepian states: \"One cannot help but be engaged in a philosophical \n        activity when dealing reflectively with such matters as consciousness, \n        evidence, purposiveness, awareness, irreversibility, and the self.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref28\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note28\">[28]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        Even Veatch, in promoting the view that PVS patients are dead, recognizes \n        that \"measuring irreversible loss of capacity for a brain function \n        such as consciousness involves fundamentally nonscientific value judgments.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref29\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note29\">[29]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Yet there is also medical \n        evidence to dispute the belief that PVS patients are unconscious. Many \n        studies show that patients in induced comas do retain some sort of consciousness.<sup><a name=\"Ref30\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note30\">[30]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        These studies </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;. . . provide us with a \n        broad range of empirical evidence which is robustly compatible with the \n        thesis that some comatose patients have a conscious mental life of some \n        sort--maybe even a mental life which is richer than that of some sleeping \n        persons; or maybe a mental life which has a quality unlike any with which \n        we are presently acquainted.<sup><a name=\"Ref31\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note31\">[31]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;This at least invalidates \n        the MSTF's claim that those under deep general anesthesia (i.e. induced \n        coma) are people \"whom <i>all</i> would agree are unaware and insensate\"<sup><a name=\"Ref32\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note32\">[32]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        (emphasis added). </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The extent of cerebral cortex \n        damage leads the MSTF to confidently assert that PVS patients are \"noncognitive, \n        nonsentient, and incapable of conscious experience.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref33\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note33\">[33]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        Yet the physical location of our 'seat of consciousness' \"remains \n        a hotly debated issue.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref34\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note34\">[34]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        There is mounting evidence that the cerebral cortex is not the only area \n        of the brain involved in cognition.

The MSTF argument also implies that brute \n        animals cannot experience pain since they are not self-conscious. Howsepian \n        finds this to be \"at best counterintuitive and at worst patently \n        false.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref47\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note47\">[47]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The confident assertion \n        that PVS patients cannot suffer or experience pain is premature. Replying \n        to a letter noting this, the MSTF admitted that \"a minority\" \n        of neurologists believe some PVS patients could be conscious, and \"an \n        even smaller minority\" maintain PVS patients experience pain and \n        suffering.<sup><a name=\"Ref48\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note48\">[48]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        Regardless of the size of this minority, medical opinion is divided, an \n        important fact the MSTF report failed to mention. If PVS patients do experience \n        pain, this is significant evidence against their being unconscious. We \n        should at least seriously consider the potential our responses have for \n        affecting their levels of pain and suffering of all types. </p>\n      <p><b>A Christian Argument for Withholding Food and Fluids \n        </b></p>\n      <p><b>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</b>Many medical organizations \n        support the removal of food and fluids from patients in PVS.<sup><a name=\"Ref49\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note49\">[49]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        This reflects society's opinion on this issue. In three separate surveys, \n        over 80% of the American public said they would want food and fluids removed \n        if they were in PVS.<sup><a name=\"Ref50\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note50\">[50]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        Numerous medical ethicists support this decision for a variety of reasons, \n        some of which were given at the beginning of this paper. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Should Christians lend their \n        support to this growing consensus in our society? Peter Emmett, a Christian \n        physician, comprehensively surveyed the arguments for and against withholding \n        or withdrawing food and fluids from PVS patients. He concluded that a \n        satisfactory answer would appear only if humans were seen as made in the \n        image of God.<sup><a name=\"Ref51\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note51\">[51]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        He stated that the image of God is present in all humans who have the \n        capacity to image God, seen as some level of relational and rational abilities. \n        In a subsequent article, he claimed that a patient in PVS \"is no \n        longer the image of God because physiological life, permanently devoid \n        of relationality and cognition, is not adequate to be <i>imago Dei</i>.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref52\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note52\">[52]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Robert V. Rakestraw developed \n        this argument further. For him, to be an image of God \"presupposes \n        some capacity, either actual or at least potential, for self-awareness \n        and self-direction, for relationships and for the exercise of authority \n        over creation.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref53\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note53\">[53]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        He concluded, \"A body without neocortical functioning cannot image \n        God . . . Neocortical destruction is both a necessary and sufficient condition \n        for declaring an individual dead theologically.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref54\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note54\">[54]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;John Jefferson Davis comes \n        to this same conclusion. He has claimed that a patient with no potential \n        for life, relationships or consciousness should be viewed as \"biblically \n        dead.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref55\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note55\">[55]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        He supported his view by noting that the soul can live without a physical \n        body in the Intermediate State (2 Cor 5:1-8). Based on this, he concluded \n        that in PVS it is plausible that the patient's body lives on without his \n        or her soul. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Evangelicals are not alone \n        in developing this type of theological argument. Schotsmans, a Roman Catholic \n        scholar, put it this way: \"The PVS patient has lost his personality, \n        become totally dependant, cannot organize his own life. He is no longer \n        a free human being. . . . He is socially dead . . .\"<sup><a name=\"Ref56\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note56\">[56]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        The Jesuit ethicist, Kevin Wildes, wrote that with the extent of brain \n        damage in PVS \". . . it seems impossible to argue that a substantial \n        union of body and soul remains or that an obligation to sustain life remains.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref57\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note57\">[57]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;All of these arguments are \n        based on the assumption that a patient in PVS is unconscious and has no \n        potential for cognition or awareness. However, we have shown how precarious \n        this assumption is. Even if a patient shows no evidence of consciousness, \n        there may still be some form of consciousness present. Even if the cerebral \n        cortex is destroyed, medical evidence shows that other areas of the brain \n        are involved in cognition and awareness. Even if there is no consciousness \n        present now, that does not imply there is no potential for consciousness. \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Under Rakestraw's own definition, \n        current medical knowledge suggests that he reaches the wrong conclusion. \n        PVS patients do remain images of God. He distinguishes PVS patients from \n        the severely handicapped because \"some capacity and potential--however \n        slight--for imaging God is present in these [latter] cases.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref58\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note58\">[58]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        For him, to be an image of God one only needs some <i>potential</i> for \n        these abilities, which some medical experts believe PVS patients have. \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The underlying problem is \n        with the attempt to categorize <i>all</i> PVS patients as <i>completely</i> \n        unconscious. In contrast, others propose that PVS include a continuum \n        of levels of consciousness.<sup><a name=\"Ref59\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note59\">[59]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        This more accurately reflects the clinical difficulty in diagnosing a \n        complete lack of consciousness. The awakening of Gary Dockery after 71/2 \n        years has dramatically revealed this difficulty. Various medical experts \n        involved with the case were reported as describing his condition as PVS, \n        locked in syndrome, or some coma-like state.<sup><a name=\"Ref60\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note60\">[60]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        Dockery's condition seems to have fluctuated along a continuum of consciousness, \n        and does not fit neatly into any one syndrome. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;This continuum was acknowledged \n        by the original describers of PVS, who then asserted \"it seems wise \n        to make an absolute distinction\" between those who show evidence \n        of consciousness and those who don't.<sup><a name=\"Ref61\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note61\">[61]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        Once this is done, people can view PVS patients as distinctly different \n        from other patients, which justifies treating them differently. First \n        classifying patients is assumed to clarify our moral obligations to them. \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The Christian authors similarly \n        categorize PVS patients, after first figuring out what it means to be \n        an image of God. Certain rational, spiritual, moral, or relational capacities \n        are proposed as integral to being an image of God. Any human who does \n        not have these capacities (or the potential to develop them) is not an \n        image of God. We no longer have any obligation to keep these humans alive, \n        while we do with humans who are images of God.<sup><a name=\"Ref62\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note62\">[62]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        Once again, the assumption is that if we first categorize patients as \n        images of God, or not, the right treatment will be apparent.<sup><a name=\"Ref63\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note63\">[63]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        </p>\n      <p><b>Determining Who Is A Person </b></p>\n      <p><b>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</b>The \n        argument over who is an image of God resembles the argument over who is \n        a person.

When asked \n        to identify ourselves, we do not first classify ourselves as persons and \n        proceed from there. Rather, we think of ourselves in terms of our relationships \n        with one another: I am a father, teacher, son, etc. When we think about \n        caring for the dying, we do not care for them because they are persons. \n        \"We care or do not care for them because they are Uncle Charlie, \n        or my father, or a good friend.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref68\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note68\">[68]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;So why do authors keep returning \n        to the question of personhood? Our society has no moral consensus on how \n        we ought to care for our dying parents or friends. But we still want guidelines \n        to help make decisions at these times. In a pluralistic society, abstract, \n        generic terms seem most appropriate in formulating these guidelines. We \n        also shift to discussing issues in terms of our rights. In medical ethics, \n        the dominant view of rights is that grounded in respect for persons. Hence, \n        we pursue some calculus to determine who is a person and who is not.<sup><a name=\"Ref69\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note69\">[69]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        Having figured this out, we assume it will be clear who should get which \n        treatment. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;But the controversy is not \n        so readily resolved. Current literature on PVS contains well-reasoned \n        arguments viewing PVS patients as persons, and others viewing them as \n        non-persons. Food and fluids can reasonably be defended as ordinary or \n        extraordinary. The hope that abstract philosophy would yield logical answers \n        that all reasonable people would accept, has never been realized. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Given this uncertainty, \n        it seems that any decision may be ethical. The focus then shifts to competency, \n        debating who has the right to make these decisions.<sup><a name=\"Ref70\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note70\">[70]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        Referring to decisions about PVS patients, one writer applauds this: \". \n        . . it is crucial, I believe, that we keep our focus clearly on the question \n        of <i>who</i> should have the right to make the decision, rather than \n        on the decision itself\"<sup><a name=\"Ref71\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note71\">[71]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        (emphasis original).

Eccl 11:5 states: \"Just as you do not know \n        how the spirit enters the bones in the womb of the pregnant woman, so \n        you do not know the activity of God who makes all things.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref74\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note74\">[74]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        We lack the knowledge to make confident assertions that some living humans \n        do not have the potential to be images of God or persons. Instead we should \n        accept that all living humans are images of God. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Using an analogy from agriculture, \n        this passage encourages us to continue scattering our seed even though \n        we can't know which will grow (Eccl 11:6). We must continue to act in \n        the face of uncertainty, basing our hope and security on God's grace.<sup><a name=\"Ref75\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note75\">[75]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        Similarly, we have no idea if feeding those in PVS will \"succeed.\" \n        Yet we must at least give the body the opportunity to show us the amazing \n        power of God. It is the very tenacity of the human body to go on living \n        which seems frustrating with PVS patients. But by refusing to feed them, \n        we are placing our hope in death, not in God's grace. As attractive and \n        merciful as death may seem, it remains our enemy (1 Cor 15:26). </p>\n      <p><b>Acting as Images of God </b></p>\n      <p><b>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</b>Being \n        an image of God is not just a title bestowed on humans. It brings with \n        it certain responsibilities. In the Ancient Near East the term \"image\" \n        was used to describe a statue left by a conquering king as a reminder \n        of his presence, even though he might be physically absent.<sup><a name=\"Ref76\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note76\">[76]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        Seeing the image, people were forced to remember whose land they occupied, \n        and act in an appropriate manner. Thus the image was seen as the representative \n        or ambassador of the ruler. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;This explains why such an \n        important phrase occurs so infrequently in the Bible. The focus is not \n        on <i>who</i> is an image of God, but on how we can live as <i>true</i> \n        images of God. Much of the Bible explains how we can be his faithful representatives. \n        God gave Adam and Eve dominion over the earth, but he also gave them directions \n        on how to be good stewards of the land (Gen 1:28-30). If they had properly \n        imaged God to the rest of creation, they would have maintained the harmony \n        and goodness in which it was created. This is part of the value and responsibility \n        of being an image of God. As the Jewish scholar Abraham Heschel commented, \n        \"No image of the Supreme may be fashioned, save one: our own life \n        as an image of His will. Man, formed in His likeness, was made to imitate \n        His ways of mercy. He has delegated to man the power to act in His stead. \n        We represent Him in relieving affliction, in granting joy. Striving for \n        integrity, helping our fellow men.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref77\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note77\">[77]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;As images of God we are \n        given the amazing capacity to form a personal relationship with the God \n        of the universe. But as a result of the Fall, we are no longer born into \n        this relationship (John 1:12-13; 3:5-7). Many people live their lives \n        alienated from God and thus cannot act as true images of God. As Carl \n        Henry put it, each person is now a \"shattered image.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref78\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note78\">[78]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Christ is the only true \n        image of God (2 Cor 4:4; Col 1:15). By establishing a relationship with \n        Christ we can begin to restore our shattered image (Rom 8:29). Christians \n        are called to actively participate in this process of sanctification (Col \n        3:10). As we seek to live our lives by the power of the Holy Spirit, according \n        to the example of Christ, we will have the character of God formed in \n        us and thus become truer images of God. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;While all of us fall short \n        of being true images of God (Rom 3:23), by the grace of God, we all remain \n        images of God (Gen 9:6; Jas 3:9). These two passages apply to all humans, \n        even those missing the most basic ingredient needed to act as a true image: \n        a relationship with God. These humans retain the privilege and value of \n        being an image of God, even though their capacity for moral and spiritual \n        vitality is severely compromised (John 15:4-5; Eph 2:1-5). We should be \n        very slow to think that some are no longer images of God because they \n        seem to have little capacity for rational or emotional vitality. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Scripture describes us as \n        images of God to encourage us to act as his true representatives. This \n        concept does give guidance in moral issues. However, in responding to \n        patients in PVS, we should not focus on determining which living humans \n        are images of God. Rather we should focus on how we as images of God should \n        act towards other living human beings, including those in PVS. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Jesus encountered a similar \n        issue when a lawyer asked him: \"Who is my neighbor?\" (Luke 10:29). \n        The lawyer believed that once he knew which people were his neighbors \n        he would treat them accordingly. He obviously thought that one type of \n        action was required towards neighbors, and something different towards \n        non-neighbors. He just needed some help figuring out which was which. \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Jesus' reply in the Parable \n        of the Good Samaritan rejects this whole question (Luke 10:30-37). This \n        story clearly shows that all humans should be treated as neighbors. We \n        should be concerned about acting as good neighbors, not trying to figure \n        out who is, or is not, my neighbor. Often we learn that someone is our \n        neighbor <i>after</i> an interaction in which he or she is treated <i>as</i> \n        a neighbor by being cared for, interacted with and protected.<sup><a name=\"Ref79\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note79\">[79]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        The status of \"neighbor\" is something we should acknowledge \n        in all strangers, not something we confer upon some after abstract speculation \n        (Deut 10:19). </p>\n      <p><b>Practical Problems with Abstract Concepts </b></p>\n      <p><b>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</b>The \n        attempt to determine how we ought to treat others by first classifying \n        them (as persons, images of God, or neighbors) is more compatible with \n        a rationalistic world view than a biblical one. Yet the very objectivity \n        this method seeks to provide becomes a fatal weakness when it distances \n        us from the people we are trying to help. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;We need to detach ourselves \n        to some extent from some situations to avoid purely emotional decisions \n        and to ensure sound principles are followed. However, abstract ideas sometimes \n        disengage us too much from uncomfortable situations. Classifying strangers \n        as non-neighbors is an easy way to rationalize not stepping out in faith \n        to meet their needs. The priest and the Levite did not view the injured \n        man as a neighbor, and left him dying on the road. Too much aloofness \n        can foster inhumane decisions. This aloofness can be fostered by the types \n        of questions asked in ethical dilemmas, as the following case study reveals.<sup><a name=\"Ref80\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note80\">[80]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Michael is a 21-year-old \n        resident at White Oaks, a long-term care facility. He has the physical \n        size of a 7-year-old and the mental age of a 2- to 21/2-year-old. He is \n        not in PVS, but his situation raises similar issues. When admitted to \n        a hospital for an appendectomy, some of the staff wondered about how aggressively \n        to treat him. The ethics consultant recalls what they were saying. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;There's so little there; \n        so little quality of life; so little human life. He is not ambulatory; \n        he doesn't have any intellectual life; he has no companionship and seems \n        incapable of it; his parents never visit him at White Oaks and they've \n        never visited him here. He's just one of our White Oaks patients, like \n        so many others, and each time we get him better, he just goes back to \n        White Oaks, and that's no life (p. 279-80). </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;They want the consultant \n        to determine what he thinks of \"his quality of life and our responsibilities\" \n        (p. 279). They want to classify Michael to somehow make future tough decisions \n        easier. However, the consultant turns the case along a different path \n        when he talks to Dr. McDonough, one of the residents. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;\"Dr. McDonough, what \n        was this patient like? How did he strike you? What did you think of him?\" \n        . . . He said, \"Michael is a very strange individual. He shows unusual \n        behavior. I'll never forget him--how he seems to be capable of just three \n        things. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;\"First, if you call \n        out his name very loudly he turns to you and bestows on you a wonderful \n        smile. It is the smile of a saint. I've never seen anything like it before--beautiful \n        but eery--and he keeps smiling at you for a while. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;\"Second, he has a toy \n        tractor in his bed. He holds it in front of his face and spins the two \n        back wheels for several hours at a time, but with a look of great concentration. \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;\"The third thing about \n        him I'll never forget: he does what I would call finger ballets. He touches \n        his fingers together, then closes his hands, opens them again as though \n        he were playing 'Here's the church and here's the steeple,' and then, \n        well, he does a kind of ballet with his fingers. Again, he has a look \n        of concentration on his face like Vladimir Horowitz performing on piano.\" \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;\"How do you feel about \n        him?\" I asked Dr. McDonough. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;\". . . I will confess \n        to feeling fear and a bit of fright when I'm in his presence. I haven't \n        had much experience at this.\" Then, under his breath, Dr. McDonough \n        added quietly, \"He's like an alien to me. I don't know his world\" \n        (p. 280). </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;There is naturally some \n        alienation between us and those in conditions we do not experience or \n        understand. This is very pronounced with those in PVS. But we can alienate \n        them even more when we classify them abstractly. Even the word \"vegetative\" \n        in PVS alienates them from us.<sup><a name=\"Ref81\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note81\">[81]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        God has reached across the alienation between us and him. We are similarly \n        called to reach out to the strangers of the world, even those around whom \n        we feel uncomfortable (2 Cor 5:16-21). As we attempt to image him truthfully, \n        we ought to reach across the barriers to those in PVS. Our concern should \n        be how we can act as neighbors towards these patients who are strangers \n        to us in profound ways.<sup><a name=\"Ref82\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note82\">[82]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        In doing so, we may be surprised that they respond more like an image \n        of God than our abstract speculation might predict. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;For example, when PVS patients \n        in one nursing home were treated more like persons, they responded accordingly. \n        Often the simplest things made the biggest differences. In most institutions \n        PVS patients continually lie in bed in the same room. As the director \n        of this home stated, \"We have found that adequate seating has improved \n        awareness and arousal. . . . Our first object is to get them sitting up. \n        It is amazing the response this produces. Body tone improves, head control \n        appears. They look around and may focus on objects or companions.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref83\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note83\">[83]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Another author claims that \n        the idea of these patients being \"dead\" or \"non-persons\" \n        is a prejudice.<sup><a name=\"Ref84\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note84\">[84]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        The problem is not that these patients are no longer persons, but that \n        we do not know how to communicate with them. His assumptions are that \n        if patients in comas are accepted as persons, if the sounds and movements \n        made by them are taken as attempts to communicate, not just meaningless \n        reflexes, and if time is spent replying to them in the language of their \n        signals, contact can be made with them. He reports establishing verbal \n        or non-verbal communication with many people in comas and PVS.<sup><a name=\"Ref85\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note85\">[85]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        While the New Age assumptions which underlie some of Mindell's views must \n        be examined carefully in light of a biblical world view, the evidence \n        recorded in his book is significant. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The observations of people \n        working with PVS patients suggest that the notion that they are no longer \n        persons or images of God is wrong. The fact that just one patient regained \n        consciousness after three years in PVS makes it clear that we ought not \n        argue that these people are no longer images of God. It is an arbitrary \n        classification based on a judgment that this form of life is not worth \n        living.<sup><a name=\"Ref86\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note86\">[86]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        Instead, we ought to treat them as images of God, which would minimally \n        involve physical, relational and spiritual sustenance. This means giving \n        them food and fluids, spending time with them, interacting with them, \n        and praying and reading Scripture with them. </p>\n      <p><b>The Importance of Protection </b></p>\n      <p><b>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</b>There \n        is another major problem with attempts to determine who is, and who is \n        not, an image of God. Hauerwas has noted that in medical ethics \"person\" \n        is usually a protective notion. However, in literature arguing that some \n        humans are not persons it is used primarily \"as a permissive notion \n        that takes the moral heat off certain quandaries raised by modern medicine.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref87\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note87\">[87]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        In removing this protective aspect, and viewing certain humans as non-persons, \n        or no longer images of God, we condone practices we would otherwise view \n        as wrong. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Human history is littered \n        with the tragedies of slavery, racism, sexism and Nazism. These witness \n        to what can happen when some people view others as less than fully persons, \n        or unworthy of life.<sup><a name=\"Ref88\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note88\">[88]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        Many accept abortion because they do not view the unborn as persons. By \n        the same classification, some no longer feel an obligation to feed and \n        hydrate patients who would otherwise remain alive. How broadly will this \n        classification extend? At the time of writing, the United States Supreme \n        Court was considering hearing a case involving the withdrawal of artificially \n        administered food and fluids from an incompetent, <i>but conscious</i> \n        patient.<sup><a name=\"Ref89\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note89\">[89]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        Some already argue that advanced Alzheimer's patients are former persons \n        and should be allowed to die.<sup><a name=\"Ref90\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note90\">[90]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        Infanticide is defended by others by claiming that young infants are non-persons.<sup><a name=\"Ref91\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note91\">[91]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The Bible uses the image \n        of God concept in the context of protection (Gen 5:1-2; 9:6; Jas 3:9). \n        Images of God should be protected. But protection of others should characterize \n        images of God as they strive to act as his faithful representatives. We \n        can mold our character to be more like his by protecting the vulnerable. \n        God declares that pleading the cause of the afflicted and the needy is \n        the essence of what it means to know him (Jer 22:16). Those who are gracious \n        to the needy honor God (Prov 14:31). </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The NT reveals a similar \n        picture of God's concern for the protection of the needy and the outcasts \n        of society. Matthew clearly points to how important this was to Jesus. \n        The first miracles of Jesus narrated in Matthew's gospel were healings \n        done for the outcasts of Jewish society: a leper, a Gentile, a servant \n        and a woman (Matt 8:1-17). Throughout his ministry Jesus went to those \n        seen as being of little benefit to society. This focus was maintained \n        in the NT church (Acts 4:34-35). Those who are images of God should give \n        to the needy as a way to glorify God, but also out of gratitude for how \n        much they have already received from him (2 Cor 9:13-15). </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;We are called to protect \n        more than just images of God. Dominion of the earth was not a license \n        to exploit and ruin, but was to lead us to protect creation and help it \n        flourish (Gen 2:15). Laws protected the land (Num 25:2-5) and animals \n        (Exod 23:5, 11-12; Deut 25:4) to ensure they were nourished and rested. \n        An attitude of protection should characterize images of God. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Those who will inherit the \n        kingdom of God are those who feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, \n        clothe the naked, and spend time with the sick and imprisoned (Matt 25:31-46). \n        God knows our most basic needs are for nourishment and protection, and \n        he promises to provide these (Matt 6:25-34). Faithful images of God should \n        promise nourishment and protection to all, including PVS patients, regardless \n        of whether or not they are viewed as images of God. </p>\n      <p><b>The Cost Factor </b></p>\n      <p><b>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</b>God \n        gives us use of the earth's resources, but we are to use them wisely (Gen \n        1:29-30; Luke 16:11; Acts 10:10-16). Could the limited resources of our \n        health care system not be better used if we let PVS patients die? Many \n        do not want to bring financial concerns into health care dilemmas, but \n        that is unrealistic in today's cost-cutting environment. This aspect of \n        the dilemma of PVS patients reveals other deep issues we must all grapple \n        with. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The care of PVS patients \n        is expensive. The annual cost of long-term care is estimated between $97,000 \n        and $180,000.<sup><a name=\"Ref92\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note92\">[92]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        This gives an annual cost of between $1 billion and $7 billion for all \n        PVS patients in the United States! This seems like an exorbitant amount \n        of money when we read of the scarcity of health care resources. Shewmon \n        points out the clear economic implications of viewing PVS patients as \n        dead: \"It is improper to assess families, insurance companies, or \n        taxpayers with expensive hospital bills for keeping cadavers warm.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref93\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note93\">[93]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Yet speaking in the context \n        of health care, John Kilner claims \"that the financial resources \n        exist to eliminate many of today's scarcities.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref94\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note94\">[94]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        The problem is how we in the richer countries of the world use our resources. \n        For example, in 1987, the cost of the Medicare endstage renal disease \n        program was less than what Americans spent on potato chips that year.<sup><a name=\"Ref95\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note95\">[95]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        If all Down's syndrome children born in the United States in 1980 were \n        institutionalized (and many were not, but were cared for at home), the \n        cost would have been one tenth what the nation spent on dog food that \n        year.<sup><a name=\"Ref96\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note96\">[96]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;We will find the money to \n        support what is important to us. We are faced with having to decide if \n        we will use our resources to keep alive those who have no say in the matter. \n        When the Israelites harvested their crops, they were to leave some for \n        the needy and the strangers (Lev 23:22). This is difficult enough when \n        we are being asked to go against our greedy natures. Declaring that PVS \n        patients are not images of God, and that we have no obligations to them, \n        helps us avoid dealing with unbiblical priorities in the use of our resources. \n        </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The financial concerns about \n        keeping PVS patients alive also reveal the extent of utilitarian, materialistic \n        thinking in our society. We want nothing done unless we can reap some \n        tangible benefits. People's value is often based on what they can do, \n        and not on the fact that they 'simply' are human. We think that if we \n        could do nothing for ourselves, our lives would have no meaning or value. \n        PVS patients don't seem to function very much, so we see no value in prolonging \n        their lives. How different this is from the view of life where all humans \n        are valuable because all are made in the image of God. </p>\n      <p><b>Ryan's Story </b></p>\n      <p><b>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</b>We \n        may find it hard to see how life in PVS could have meaning, but that does \n        not mean it can't. As Howsepian argues, each PVS patient presents us with \n        a \"nidus for virtue\"<sup><a name=\"Ref97\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note97\">[97]</a></sup>&#xA0;--a \n        little nest in which the seeds of virtue and character formation can be \n        nourished and challenged towards moral maturity. In doing so, the world \n        will see that we are true images of God, reflecting his love (John 13:35). \n        This is exemplified by Ryan's story. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;In May 1992, Ryan, my healthy \n        4-month old neighbor, stopped breathing. The squad resuscitated him, but \n        over the next few weeks all his cerebral cortex died. To everyone's surprise, \n        he lived when he was taken off his respirator. He continues to live at \n        a long-term care facility where he is fed and hydrated through a gastrostomy \n        tube. He is totally dependant on his care-givers, and his parents, who \n        take him home most weekends. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Ryan will never do anything \n        for his parents, but they view him the same way they do his twin brother: \n        he is still their son, another image of God. This helps them deal with \n        the tragedy of their situation. His parents praise God for the changes \n        Ryan has brought to their lives. His mother became a Christian after she \n        realized that God did not cause this accident, but wanted to help her \n        with Ryan. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Ryan's accident was not \n        fair. But as his father says, there is no reason why these things always \n        happen to other people. We cannot shield ourselves from bad things and \n        control our lives completely. He believes God will use this situation \n        somehow, though it's not yet clear how. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Ryan's parents see many \n        benefits from coping with Ryan's condition. Their priorities in life have \n        changed, for which they are thankful. They are more appreciative of the \n        little things in life, and the things they do have, like their other healthy \n        son. Time with family and other people means much more to them now. Co-workers \n        have told them that Ryan's accident has forced them to re-evaluate how \n        much time they spend with their children. They have been introduced to \n        a whole new world of caring and compassionate people: those who serve \n        the disabled. They are now more sensitive to the needs and concerns of \n        the disabled in general. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Ryan's parents continue \n        to have to make tough decisions about every medical intervention Ryan \n        needs. But they are clear about one thing: Ryan ought to be given food \n        and fluids. Though they cannot know what Ryan is aware of, they are aware \n        of their duty to let him live. He deserves this much. They have accepted \n        that he could die at any time. But they will feed him until something \n        else causes his death. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Ryan's parents treat him \n        as the image of God he is. They are acting as images of God in how they \n        respond to their son's tragedy. God has responded to the tragedy of fallen \n        human life by continuing to sustain us in spite of the fact that we often \n        do not respond to his love. He too has gotten frustrated with the lack \n        of responsiveness (Hos 11:5-9; Matt 23:37). He must at times wonder if \n        any trace of his image remains in us when we consistently refuse to act \n        as we ought. Yet he continues to love us (1 John 4:9-10). These parents \n        have chosen to image God through sustaining their son in spite of his \n        lack of responsiveness. This is pure grace, of which our world needs more \n        examples. </p>\n      <p><b>Conclusion </b></p>\n      <p><b>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</b>We \n        are faced with tough choices. But declaring some living humans no longer \n        images of God is not the answer. The Bible does not distinguish between \n        humans who are images of God and those who are not. Those making decisions \n        about loved ones in PVS are not helped by being persuaded that the dilemma \n        is illusory because those in PVS are already dead. People have to grapple \n        with the fact that their loved one lives in a tragic condition, and may \n        have little chance of recovery. But he or she is alive. Like all humans, \n        they need food and fluids to remain alive. Like many others, they need \n        help getting their nourishment. The issue is whether or not we will provide \n        the basic essentials. We have to deal with the moral implications of that \n        decision. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Those of us who believe \n        that artificially administered food and fluids should be given to PVS \n        patients may soon be called to pay for it ourselves. The pro-life movement \n        has realized that responding to abortion must include providing shelter \n        and resources to those who choose to keep their babies. If death is redefined \n        to include PVS, private funding will be needed to care for these patients. \n        This will be the price we will pay for upholding the preciousness of all \n        human life. </p>\n      <p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Our God is in the business \n        of protecting and nourishing broken, discarded lives which seem to have \n        little meaning. He can use these tragedies to let his glory shine into \n        a dark and painful world. His images should respond likewise.<sup><a name=\"Ref98\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Note98\">[98]</a></sup>&#xA0; \n        </p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/articles.htm\">Go to the Publications Page</a> \n      </p>\n      <p><a name=\"Note1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>&#xA0;Bryan Jennett and Fred Plum, \n        \"Persistent Vegetative State after Brain Damage: A Syndrome in Search \n        of a Name,\" <i>Lancet</i> 1 (April 1972): 734-47. <i>Return to <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Ref1\">Text</a></i> \n      </p>\n      <p><a name=\"Note2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a>&#xA0;See, for example, Marcia Angell, \n        \"The Legacy of Karen Ann Quinlan,\" <i>Trends in Health Care, \n        Law &amp; Ethics</i> 8 (Winter 1993): 17-9; and Bette-Jane Crigger, \"The \n        Court and Nancy Cruzan,\" <i>Hastings Center Report</i> 20 (January-February \n        1990): 38-50. <i>Return to <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/pvs.htm#Ref2\">Text</a></i> </p>\n      <p><a name=\"Note3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a>&#xA0;Frequently cited articles from \n        various perspectives include: Joanne Lynn and James F.

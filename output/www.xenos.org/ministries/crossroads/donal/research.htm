This \n        journal is a publication of <a href=\"http://www1.gospelcom.net/iv/ncf\">Nurses \n        Christian Fellowship</a>, and this issue included a number of related \n        shorter pieces. Another one written by me can be read by clicking on its \n        title: <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/harm.htm\">What Can Be the Harm?</a> If you'd like to return \n        to my home page and see some of the other papers I've written, my interests, \n        or get in contact with me, click on my name above.}</p>\n      <p>Proponents of Therapeutic Touch (TT) claim it has significant research \n        support. To persuade me of this, a member of a Christian college's nursing \n        faculty sent me an article by Pamela Potter Hughes and others.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/research.htm#1B\" name=\"1A\">1</a> \n        I will use this to demonstrate some of the significant problems in TT \n        research and how that research is misused to promote TT. </p>\n      <p>This qualitative study's only findings were that TT recipients enjoyed \n        the experience. Seven adolescents were interviewed after receiving TT. \n        Each was to receive three treatments per week for two weeks, but only \n        one person followed the protocol. Two refused to return after their first \n        treatment; one was treated for four weeks; and three missed various numbers \n        of treatments.</p>\n      <p>Inconsistency also occurred because some nurses included physical contact \n        in their treatments, while others did not. Physical contact alone can \n        have a beneficial effect. Because of poor methodology, the significance \n        of this research is best summarized by the authors themselves: \"It \n        is possible that just being in a quiet place with a nurse therapist may \n        have been sufficient to provide a unique experience for the patients as \n        opposed to any changes occurring because of an energy exchange.\" \n        More rigorous research than this is needed to support the claims of TT.</p>\n      <p>However, Hughes's article has more problems. Its literature review makes \n        grossly exaggerated claims about earlier research and in places is blatantly \n        false. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated example. Many TT articles, \n        especially those in popular nursing journals, misrepresent the conclusions \n        of the original researchers. Hughes states: \"For example, Therapeutic \n        Touch has been found to be an effective adjunct to medical treatment for \n        decreasing anxiety (Heidt, 1981; Olson, Sneed, Bondonna, Ratliff &amp; \n        Dias, 1992; Parkes, 1985; Quinn, 1984).\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/research.htm#2B\" name=\"2A\">2</a></p>\n      <p>This is not an accurate picture of the status of TT research on anxiety. \n        Olson's study found that TT recipients self-reported significantly reduced \n        anxiety scores. However, physiological measurements of relaxation in the \n        same subjects revealed no significant changes. The same individuals received \n        the no-treatment control after receiving TT and thus knew they were not \n        receiving treatment. This could explain why they reported feeling more \n        relaxed while physiological measurements did not confirm this. Also, only \n        eight of the twenty-three subjects did a control session, raising concerns \n        of selection biasing.</p>\n      <p>Heidt's and Quinn's studies similarly had positive findings and methodological \n        problems. Parkes, mentioned by Hughes, evaluated these: \"It appears \n        that even though Quinn (1984) and Heidt (1981) found statistically significant \n        results when measuring reduction in anxiety, the problems inherent in \n        the research designs of each of their studies suggest that the findings \n        be interpreted with caution. Even though an energy exchange might be occurring, \n        it has not been documented that it reduces anxiety in studies with more \n        controls.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/research.htm#3B\" name=\"3A\">3</a> Hughes never mentions this \n        ambiguity.</p>\n      <p>Quinn herself addressed these problems in later studies but then got \n        different results. Her data \"reveals that there were no significant \n        differences among the groups on post-test or retention anxiety, systolic \n        blood pressure or heart rate.\"<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/research.htm#4B\" name=\"4A\">4</a> Failed \n        replications of earlier studies must be acknowledged. The research has \n        not clearly shown that TT reduces anxiety. </p>\n      <p>I have found thirteen studies (mostly unpublished dissertations and theses) \n        where TT did not significantly reduce anxiety compared to controls. One \n        is Parkes's dissertation, the same one cited by Hughes as reducing anxiety! \n        After studying three groups (receiving either TT or one of two types of \n        sham-TT), Parkes stated: \"It must be concluded that Therapeutic Touch \n        did not reduce anxiety in this instance, and that the process of the research \n        itself slightly increased anxiety levels in all three groups.\"</p>\n      <p>Analysis of the other claims made for TT's effectiveness reveals a similar \n        pattern. Researchers make tentative claims, acknowledge the limitations \n        of their studies and then see their findings blown out of proportion by \n        those using their studies. Survey articles on TT must be read closely \n        and their claims investigated. Unfortunately this takes time, which many \n        do not have. As a result, the myth spreads that TT is research-supported. \n        It gains credibility, and more people get drawn into its underlying belief \n        system.</p>\n      <p>To reverse this trend, we should be familiar with some of this research. \n        We should show that we are open enough to investigate TT's claims and \n        that we care enough about those attracted to it to understand what they \n        are involved with. We must seek opportunities to show Christ's love to \n        those with whom we disagree. But for the sake of those in our care and \n        to maintain nursing's professional image, we must insist on high standards \n        in research and accuracy in the use of its findings.</p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/articles.htm\">Go to the Publications Page</a></p>\n      \n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/research.htm#1A\" name=\"1B\">1</a> Pamela Potter Hughes, Robin Meize-Grochowski \n        and Catherine Neighbor Duncan-Harris, \"Therapeutic Touch with Adolescent \n        Psychiatric Patients,\" <i>Journal of Holistic Nursing</i> 14, no. \n        1 (March 1996): 6-23.</p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/research.htm#2A\" name=\"2B\">2</a> Ibid., p. 7, referencing Patricia Heidt, \n        \"Effect of Therapeutic Touch on Anxiety Levels of Hospitalized Patients,\" \n        <i>Nursing Research</i> 30, no. 1 (January/February 1981): 32-37; Melodie \n        Olson et al., \"Therapeutic Touch and Post-Hurricane Hugo Stress,\" \n        <i>Journal of Holistic Nursing</i> 10, no.2 (June 1992): 120-36; Brenda \n        Sue Parkes, \"Therapeutic Touch As an Intervention to Reduce Anxiety \n        in Elderly Hospitalized Patients\" (PhD diss., University of Texas \n        at Austin, 1985); Janet F.

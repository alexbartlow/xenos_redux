Those accents got there because I'm from Ireland. \n        Labhraim Gaeilge, ach n&#xED; faighim m&#xF3;r&#xE1;n cleachtadh anseo. I came to the \n        United States in 1982 after finishing a degree in pharmacy at Trinity \n        College, Dublin. While in graduate school at The Ohio State University, \n        I ran into some people who attended <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Xenos \n        Christian Fellowship</a>. As you might imagine, being a graduate student \n        in the hard sciences, I had a lot of questions about Christianity. However, \n        God used those guys, and a lot of investigation into the claims of the \n        Bible, to lead me into a personal relationship with him. </p>\n      <p>I graduated in 1988 with my PhD in natural products (a.k.a. medicinal) \n        chemistry. I also developed an interest in medical ethics, and received \n        an MA in theology, focusing on medical ethics, from Ashland Theological \n        Seminary in 1994. I'm now Professor of Bioethics &amp; of Chemistry at \n        Mount Carmel College of Nursing in Columbus, Ohio. I've written and spoken \n        on a number of issues in medical ethics, especially on alternative medicine, \n        assisted suicide, and genetics. Check out my <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/index.htm\">list \n        of publications</a>, and from there you can get copies of some of my papers. \n        I strive to apply the Bible faithfully to these issues, as a result of \n        which I was named a Fellow of the <a href=\"http://bioethix.org\">Center \n        for Bioethics and Human Dignity</a> in Chicago, a Christian bioethics \n        center.</p>\n      <p>I'm still very active at Xenos, where I met my wife, Cheri. We've been \n        blessed with three wonderful children. Catrina was born in 1990, Conor \n        in 1993, and Peter in 1996. Cheri and I serve together at Xenos through \n        the <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/reach.htm\">Reach</a> ministry \n        and <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/justforfun/cc1.htm\">Conversation \n        &amp; Cuisine</a>. Cheri also serves in the <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/oasis/oasis.htm\">Oasis</a> \n        program, and I'm involved in the <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/index.htm\">Crossroads Project</a> \n        and have taught <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/index.htm\">courses</a> \n        on \"Science and Christianity\" and \"Medical Ethics.\"</p>\n      <p>I hope you have time to browse some of my writings. I'd love to hear \n        from you about any of them, so don't hesitate to <a href=\"mailto:OMathunaD@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">send \n        me a message</a>. I do some speaking on these issues. Contact me for more \n        information if you're interested in that.</p>\n    </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/graphics/donal2.jpg","title":"Dónal O'Mathúna","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/personal.htm"}

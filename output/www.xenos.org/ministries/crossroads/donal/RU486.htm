O'Math&#xFA;na</a></p>\n      <p>{Printed in the Marion Star on February 3, 2001, p. 6A}</p>\n      <p>American physicians are receiving deliveries of the abortion pill to \n        prevent deliveries of unwanted babies. The controversial RU-486, also \n        called mifepristone, is now available under the brand name Mifeprex. It \n        is supposedly safer and more private since the abortions will occur in \n        the comfort of the woman's home, not an abortion clinic. Anyone who has \n        experienced or witnessed a miscarriage knows this is far from the truth. \n        All the blood and tears associated with spontaneous miscarriages demonstrate \n        that take-home abortions are not the answer. <br>\n      </p>\n      <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved RU-486 in September after \n        more than a decade of debate. However, the FDA included a list of restrictions \n        which should have everyone concerned about this drug's safety. RU-486 \n        will only be available directly from physicians who meet certain qualifications. \n        They must first be able to accurately determine the gestational age of \n        the fetus. No more than seven weeks should have passed since the beginning \n        of the woman's last menstrual period. Practically speaking, this leaves \n        a relatively narrow 'window of opportunity' for using the drug. Before \n        this, many women will not realize they are pregnant; after this, the risks \n        of serious bleeding and incomplete abortions increase dramatically.<br>\n      </p>\n      <p>Physicians who prescribe RU-486 must also be able to respond to emergencies \n        that may arise after the pill is taken. During clinical trials, between \n        three and eight women out of every hundred taking RU-486 were pregnant \n        two weeks later and required surgical abortions. Almost everyone had cramping \n        and bleeding, some severe. About two percent of the women had so much \n        bleeding they required blood transfusions, and another one percent needed \n        surgery to stop the bleeding. Two-thirds had nausea, and a third had vomiting, \n        dizziness, and fever. Researchers have widely acknowledged that RU-486 \n        abortions are longer, more painful, and involve more blood loss than surgical \n        abortions.<br>\n      </p>\n      <p>However, the FDA fast-tracked RU-486's approval, skipping some of the \n        research normally required to carefully examine the risks associated with \n        a new drug. RU-486 was approved under a special protocol called \"21 \n        CFR 314 Subpart H.\" These regulations were approved in 1992 after \n        AIDS and cancer patients complained that new drugs for their life-threatening \n        illnesses took too long to approve. The regulations specifically apply \n        to new drugs \"for serious or life-threatening illnesses.\" How \n        does a drug designed to end unwanted pregnancies qualify under these guidelines? \n        The FDA wrote \"that the termination of an unwanted pregnancy is a \n        serious condition within the scope of subpart H.\" <br>\n      </p>\n      <p>Pregnancy is being viewed as the equivalent of a life-threatening illness \n        to further broaden the availability of abortion. Language is manipulated \n        to further a political agenda. Approval under Subpart H not only fast-tracks \n        a drug, it helps its manufacturer avoid strict liability for injuries \n        related to the drug. Women are supposed to understand that Subpart H approval \n        means they have less assurance of the drug's safety since, technically, \n        it is still an experimental treatment. While someone with a terminal illness \n        may want to take that risk, how many unwanted pregnancies are as life-threatening \n        as AIDS or cancer? <br>\n      </p>\n      <p>RU-486 promoters argue that it brings more privacy to abortion. But its \n        FDA regulations require at least three doctor's visits. After taking RU-486 \n        on the first visit, the woman must return two days later for another drug, \n        misoprostol or Cytotec. RU-486 prevents the normal development of the \n        fetus, and the second drug starts contractions which expel the growing \n        fetus from the uterus. A third visit is required two weeks later, to ensure \n        the abortion is complete. If not, the woman will require the surgical \n        abortion she was trying to avoid in the first place.<br>\n      </p>\n      <p>This second drug raises further questions about the risks of RU-486 abortions. \n        In August, its manufacturer (G. D. Searle) wrote US doctors warning against \n        misoprostol's use during abortions (or normal labor). Its only approved \n        use is in treating ulcers, and its safety in pregnant women has not been \n        tested. Number serious adverse events, including maternal death, have \n        been reported after its unapproved usage.<br>\n      </p>\n      <p>Advocates claim RU-486 affords pregnant women access to safer and more \n        private abortions. Neither is the case. The drug is a poison that people \n        hope will be more detrimental to the unborn than to women. Its main benefits \n        are in protecting the doctor's privacy, not the woman's. Its fast-track \n        approval protects its manufacturer from the consequences of its adverse \n        effects, but not the injured woman.<br>\n      </p>\n      <p>RU-486 further pushes the morality of one segment of our society upon \n        the rest of us. Abortion advocates would have us believe that the human \n        life developing within a woman is only as valuable as she believes. This \n        puts an arbitrary value on all human life. Promoting the illusion that \n        abortion is no more than popping a few pills to make a negative situation \n        disappear impacts all of society.<br>\n      </p>\n      <p>The situations that lead women to consider abortion are difficult and \n        complicated. No answer is easy, but that doesn't mean all answers are \n        equal. Abortion uses the death of an innocent human to help people out \n        of tough situations. We are left with a dead fetus and thoughts of what \n        might have been. Instead, allowing the fetus to live, and enlisting others' \n        help, uses the gift of life to help develop the character and resources \n        needed to tackle tough situations ethically. Do we value life enough to \n        make the sacrifices necessary to accept and nurture all human lives? If \n        not, which humans will we reject next?</p>\n      \n    </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Abortion Pill Arrives","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/RU486.htm"}

Or, stay here and explore to get a better idea of what \n              I've been doing professionally. In my list of published papers you'll \n              see that some of them have links to the complete text. You can download \n              the ones that are on this site. I'm working to get more of them \n              put on here, so if you're interested in these topics, check back \n              for new material! I'm interested in giving presentations on these \n              issues, so feel free to contact me about doing one for you if that \n              interests you. </p>\n            <p>I hope these materials will stimulate further discussions and help \n              you as you think through these issues. I'd love to hear from you \n              about any of them.</p>\n          </td>\n          <td width=\"8%\" valign=\"top\"></td>\n        </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/graphics/donal2.jpg","title":"Donal O'Mathuna's Articles, Publications, and Other Materials","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/index.htm"}

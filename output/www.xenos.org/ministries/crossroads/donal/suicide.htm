Furthermore, \n        the Justices studiously avoided the course of philosophically and theologically \n        based moral discourse on suicide and euthanasia. They did, however, urge \n        the American people to sustain debate on physician-assisted suicide in \n        public fora and legislative assemblies with a view to the High Court's \n        reconsidering the matter when new laws, challenged, reach the final stage \n        of the appellate process.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Suicide and euthanasia will \n        undoubtedly be vigorously debated not only as legal, but also as moral \n        issues. The role of religious traditions in this debate, and how these \n        should effect and affect public policy, must also be addressed. Suicide \n        and euthanasia raise important issues which theological reflection has \n        addressed for centuries. Theological beliefs affect what people think \n        about issues central to this debate, such as how people cope with pain \n        and suffering, what they believe follows death, and whether they believe \n        their bodies are theirs to do with as they please. Three-quarters of all \n        Americans claim their religious beliefs are the primary influence on how \n        they find guidance in their lives.<sup><a name=\"Ref2\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        This is particularly the case with issues of life and death. Whether or \n        not one agrees with the theological conclusions, they remain of utmost \n        importance to the public and hence in setting public policy.<sup><a name=\"Ref3\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n         \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Given the dominant role \n        played by Judeo-Christian traditions in America, understanding the theological \n        and historical perspectives of Christianity remains important in discussions \n        of public policy on suicide and euthanasia. It is indisputable that a \n        <i>distorted</i> understanding of this, or any other, religious tradition \n        should not impact the formulation of public policy. Yet this is precisely \n        what happened in two recent judicial opinions on physician-assisted suicide, \n        one being the Washington Court of Appeals decision reversed by the Supreme \n        Court.<sup><a name=\"Ref4\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        This article shall seek to demonstrate the theological and historical \n        inaccuracies in these opinions and to correct those misunderstandings. \n        As judicial and legislative bodies struggle with physician-assisted suicide, \n        it is imperative that their policies be based on accurate information. \n         \n      </p><p><b>History and Theology in Physician-Assisted Suicide \n        Opinions </b> \n      </p><p><b>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</b>Judge Richard C. \n        Kaufman raised the issue of Christian history and beliefs in his 1993 \n        opinion on Michigan's law proscribing assisted suicide.<sup><a name=\"Ref5\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        Dr. Jack Kevorkian, charged with violating this statute, challenged its \n        constitutionality.<sup><a name=\"Ref6\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note6\"><sup>[6]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        Judge Kaufman denied the motion, but acknowledged there was significant \n        merit in the claim that a fundamental right to terminate one's own life \n        exists, especially for terminally ill persons with intolerable pain.<sup><a name=\"Ref7\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note7\"><sup>[7]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n         \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;An important initial step \n        in evaluating this claim, according to Judge Kaufman, was to examine its \n        merits in light of the history and traditions of this nation.<sup><a name=\"Ref8\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note8\"><sup>[8]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        He noted the importance of the legal, social, and moral history of issues \n        before courts, referring in particular to Justice Blackmun, writing for \n        the majority in <i>Roe v. Wade</i>.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Most strikingly, in Roe \n        v. Wade . . . the Court justified its result, in part, by an appeal to \n        history. . . . Just as the Roe Court found some support for abortion being \n        freely practiced in Greek and Roman times, there is significant support \n        that historical attitudes toward suicide were not in line with a blanket \n        proscription. The idea that one's honor or one's quality of life would \n        allow society to recognize the act of suicide as not contrary to societal \n        norms has great historical support.<sup><a name=\"Ref9\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note9\"><sup>[9]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n         \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Judge Kaufman's short survey \n        of classical attitudes toward suicide, although containing minor factual \n        errors, is accurate insofar as ancient Greek and Roman law did not prohibit \n        either abortion or suicide. Indeed, some philosophical schools regarded \n        suicide as the ultimate expression of human freedom. Other philosophical \n        schools, however, especially Pythagoreanism (as ostensibly manifested \n        in the so-called Hippocratic Oath), condemned the act under all circumstances. \n         \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;When Judge Kaufman addressed \n        ancient Jewish and early Christian attitudes toward suicide, his analysis \n        became grossly distorted. He claimed that five biblical characters committed \n        suicide, for which none received condemnation or even negative comment.<sup><a name=\"Ref10\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note10\"><sup>[10]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        According to him, the Christian Church, under the influence of Augustine, \n        did not prohibit suicide until the sixth century and then \"it had \n        a difficult time in supporting this new position on the basis of the Scriptures.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref11\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note11\"><sup>[11]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        He concluded that \"there is significant support in our traditions \n        and history for the view approving suicide or attempted suicide.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref12\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note12\"><sup>[12]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n         \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Quoting Justice Blackmun \n        in <i>Roe v. Wade</i> to support his thesis that the so-called Hippocratic \n        Oath's condemnation of abortion and assisted suicide represented a minority \n        (i.e. Pythagorean) view, and having articulated the assessment of early \n        Christianity's openness to suicide summarized above, Judge Kaufman concluded: \n        \"But with the end of antiquity, a decided change took place. Resistance \n        against suicide and against abortion became common. The Oath came to be \n        popular. The emerging teachings of Christianity were in agreement with \n        the Pythagorean ethic.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref13\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note13\"><sup>[13]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        Space does not permit a discussion of alternative interpretations of Judge \n        Kaufman's four ambiguous sentences. However, nothing in <i>Roe v. Wade</i> \n        suggests that Justice Blackmun questioned the easily demonstrable and \n        well-known fact that abortion was consistently and uncompromisingly condemned \n        in early Christian literature. We certainly would not accuse him of being \n        so ignorant of the history of abortion as to think that early Christianity \n        did not condemn abortion until the fifth century. But this is exactly \n        what Judge Kaufman has done by combining his assertion of the ostensible \n        similarities between the moral history of abortion and suicide with his \n        insistence that early Christians both approved and widely practiced suicide \n        before Augustine's time.<sup><a name=\"Ref14\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note14\"><sup>[14]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n         \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Judge Reinhardt, in his \n        Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals' opinion reversed by the Supreme Court, \n        similarly availed himself of history and tradition to support his ruling.<sup><a name=\"Ref15\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note15\"><sup>[15]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        Although examined more briefly, and without addressing early Christian \n        attitudes toward abortion, Judge Reinhardt espoused the same mistaken \n        view of Christian history. Duncan and Lubin critiqued his overall historical \n        survey, but did not address early Christian history and only briefly examined \n        his use of the biblical suicide accounts.<sup><a name=\"Ref16\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note16\"><sup>[16]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        After noting the ancient Roman and Greek approval of many suicides, Judge \n        Reinhardt claimed, \"The early Christians saw death as an escape from \n        the tribulations of a fallen existence and as the doorway to heaven.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref17\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note17\"><sup>[17]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        He similarly claimed that none of the four (<i>sic</i>) Old Testament \n        suicides \"is treated as an act worthy of censure\" and \"the \n        suicide of Judas Iscariot is not treated as a further sin, rather as an \n        act of repentance.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref18\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note18\"><sup>[18]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        He also attributed suicide's condemnation to Augustine, \"Prompted \n        in large part by the utilitarian concern that the rage for suicide would \n        deplete the ranks of Christians. . . .\"<sup><a name=\"Ref19\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note19\"><sup>[19]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n         \n      </p><p>The same set of presuppositions and conclusions inform \n        the opinions of both judges:  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;1. The Old and New Testaments \n        not only don't condemn suicide, but their theology, especially the latter's, \n        encourages it.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;2. This is particularly \n        the case with martyrdom, which is, after all, a form of suicide.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;3. Furthermore, early Christians \n        craved death because life was so burdened by sin and guilt, and heaven \n        so eagerly anticipated that many who could not provoke pagans to martyr \n        them took their own lives.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;4. Only in the early fifth \n        century, owing to Augustine's determination to end the self-destructive \n        actions decimating the ranks of the church, did Christians first proscribe \n        suicide thus instituting a legacy of inflexible intolerance.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Before addressing these \n        issues directly, it is reasonable to suggest why these two judges have \n        such similar misunderstandings of suicide in early Christianity. In their \n        treatment of pre-Christian Judaism and early Christianity, both relied \n        primarily upon a popularized account written by a poet, literary critic, \n        and playwright, Alfred Alvarez.<sup><a name=\"Ref20\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note20\"><sup>[20]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        The historical and theological presuppositions and conclusions of Alvarez \n        are consistent with those of many philosophers, sociologists, anthropologists, \n        psychologists, and popular authors who have recently written, even incidentally, \n        on suicide among early Christians.<sup><a name=\"Ref21\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note21\"><sup>[21]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n         \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The current popularly held \n        understanding of suicide in early Christianity suggests not only an ignorance \n        of early Christian theology and history but also the conceptual influence \n        of &#x90;mile Durkheim, the father of academic sociology in France. His \n        <i>Le suicide: &#x82;tude sociologique</i> was published in 1897 but not \n        translated into English until 1951. His definition of suicide, well-known \n        to students of the social sciences, includes \"all cases of death \n        resulting directly or indirectly from a positive or negative act of the \n        victim himself, which he knows will produce this result.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref22\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note22\"><sup>[22]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n         \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Durkheim denies the relevance \n        of motivation in determining the morality of the act. Suicide is any action, \n        or lack of action, which results in one's own death regardless of whether \n        the individual actually desired to die. Hence, he classifies the death \n        of Christian martyrs as (altruistic) suicide, since they voluntarily allowed \n        their own slaughter:  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Though they did not kill \n        themselves, they sought death with all their power and behaved so as to \n        make it inevitable. To be suicide, the act from which death must necessarily \n        result need only have been performed by the victim with full knowledge \n        of the facts. Besides, the passionate enthusiasm with which the believers \n        in the new religion faced final torture shows that at this moment they \n        had completely discarded their personalities for the idea of which they \n        had become the servants.<sup><a name=\"Ref23\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note23\"><sup>[23]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n         \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;According to Durkheim, dying \n        for one's beliefs is suicide. Those who commit suicide are, in his construct, \n        victims of pathological social phenomena. Martyrs are victims not of the \n        people who kill them, but of their own religious group's demand for excessive \n        integration, control, and regimentation. Not surprisingly, when scholars \n        apply Durkheim's grid to the history of pre-Christian Judaism and early \n        Christianity, apparently ignorant not only of actual historical details \n        but also of the most fundamental beliefs and values of both, the results \n        are as distorted as the presuppositions and conclusions of Judges Kaufman \n        and Reinhardt, which we shall now address.  \n      </p><p><b>Biblical Narratives and Ethics </b> \n      </p><p><b>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</b>The \n        Bible does not explicitly condemn those who commit suicide. Seven suicides \n        are recorded in the Bible, not five as claimed by Alvarez and Judges Kaufman \n        and Reinhardt. Six occur in the Old Testament: Abimelech (who is assisted \n        in suicide), Samson, Ahithophel, King Zimri, King Saul, and Saul's armor \n        bearer; one occurs in the New Testament (Judas Iscariot).<sup><a name=\"Ref24\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note24\"><sup>[24]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        Both judges simply noted the lack of explicit condemnation of suicide \n        in these passages and deduced that no condemnation is thereby intended. \n        They then extrapolated this finding to the whole Bible. Noting the lack \n        of any command like \"Thou shalt not kill yourself!\" they claimed \n        Scripture nowhere condemns suicide. As we will see later, they ignored \n        how Judaism and Christianity have historically interpreted their Scriptures. \n         \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;While the Bible does contain \n        significant legal material (most notable, the Pentateuch), it must also \n        be seen as an intricate work of literature. Recent biblical scholarship \n        has revived interest in the literary nature of the Bible.<sup><a name=\"Ref25\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note25\"><sup>[25]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        This has been particularly important with Old Testament narratives, or \n        stories. The type, or genre, of literature to which a passage belongs \n        strongly influences how one discovers its intended meaning. For example, \n        when we read poetry we expect to find figurative language and should be \n        less inclined to interpret everything literally compared to when we read \n        history textbooks. Similarly we must note the genre of the biblical suicide \n        accounts and recognize the literary conventions used to convey meaning \n        by the authors.<sup><a name=\"Ref26\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note26\"><sup>[26]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n         \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Literary conventions are \n        commonly recognized in poetry. The study of literary patterns in narrative \n        is called poetics. While poetics alone will not ensure accurate interpretations, \n        ignoring poetics can lead to meanings the author could never have envisioned. \n        \"It is precisely in response to this danger, that a study of the \n        poetics of Hebrew narrative can provide some controls. Since its concern \n        is to recover, as far as possible, an ancient literary competence, poetics \n        offers a safeguard against reading texts according to arbitrary or anachronistic \n        criteria.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref27\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note27\"><sup>[27]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n         \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Even a cursory reading of \n        biblical narratives shows that explicit condemnations rarely occur. Yet \n        these stories were recorded to instruct people in godly living. Current \n        controversy surrounding the content of television shows and movies attests \n        to how well-told stories can teach ethics and influence moral development. \n        Rather than assume the lack of explicit evaluation commends an act, we \n        must ask why an explicit \"Yay\" or \"Nay\" is rarely \n        given. \"Literature enacts rather than states, shows rather than tells. \n        Instead of giving abstract propositions about virtue or vice, for example, \n        literature presents stories of good or evil characters in action. . . \n        .

The Old Testament in particular uses these methods, \"where instead \n        of encountering expository essays, historical treatises, and scientific \n        or theological explanations, we find well-told stories and beautifully \n        constructed poems.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref29\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note29\"><sup>[29]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        The Old Testament frequently uses irony, defined as a literary method \n        of making ethical statements by juxtaposing the way things <i>are</i> \n        to the way things <i>ought to be</i>. The indirect nature of this method \n        and the necessity for interpretation bring certain risks:  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;[T]he ironist's method forbids \n        his coming right out and saying, 'What you say or think is wrong; here \n        is what is right.' The ironic criticism requires of its hearers and readers \n        the burden of recognition, the discovery of the relation between the ironist's \n        'is' and his 'ought.' And to use the ironic method is to risk the failure \n        of this recognition, the misunderstanding of the ironist's criticism.<sup><a name=\"Ref30\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note30\"><sup>[30]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n         \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;This is precisely what happened \n        in the opinions of Judges Kaufman and Reinhardt. If they are correct to \n        emphasize only explicit biblical condemnations, the Bible can be read \n        to condone many acts most would regard as unethical. A couple of examples \n        will suffice to show the problem with this interpretive principle. Samson \n        slept with a prostitute, but we are not told he was wrong to do so.<sup><a name=\"Ref31\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note31\"><sup>[31]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        Should Christians similarly feel free to visit prostitutes? When a gang \n        of thugs sought to rape a Levite man, the owner of the house where he \n        was staying offered the Levite's concubine instead, along with his own \n        daughter.<sup><a name=\"Ref32\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note32\"><sup>[32]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        The gang repeatedly raped the concubine and left her to die outside the \n        host's house. The Levite cut her body into pieces which he sent throughout \n        Israel to mobilize a militia to punish the murderers. Is this then a biblically \n        endorsed response to violent aggressors? Shortly before his suicide, King \n        Saul used a medium to call up the spirit of the deceased Samuel.<sup><a name=\"Ref33\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note33\"><sup>[33]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        Samuel was upset at being disturbed, but does not say Saul's necromancy \n        was wrong. Is it thereby approved of?  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The latter story was not \n        given as the definitive biblical teaching on necromancy. Unlike the issue \n        of suicide, explicit biblical teaching condemns necromancy and similar \n        spiritist practices.<sup><a name=\"Ref34\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note34\"><sup>[34]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        However, a number of literary devices surrounding the story of Saul's \n        necromancy clearly show that the author did not approve of what happened. \n        In setting the scene for the story the narrator notes that Saul had banned \n        all mediums and psychics from Israel, and the medium even reminds Saul \n        of this!<sup><a name=\"Ref35\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note35\"><sup>[35]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        These comments explain why Saul disguised himself to visit the medium, \n        but also make an important ethical comment: Saul was now making use of \n        the very thing he had earlier believed immoral. The story also states \n        that Saul did this out of desperation and because of a lack of communication \n        with Yahweh. Without an explicit comment the author uses literary devices \n        to communicate clearly that Saul was using unethical means of obtaining \n        information. This conclusion fits into the larger theme of the books of \n        Samuel which show the down-hill slide of Saul's reign leading to the establishment \n        of David's reign, which we will see is very relevant in analyzing Saul's \n        suicide.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The biblical suicide accounts, \n        similarly examined, reveal much helpful information. These literary clues \n        alone will not lead to an absolutely clear position on the biblical view \n        of suicide. However, as we will now show, in every case it is completely \n        inappropriate to conclude that the accounts condone or approve of suicide. \n        Every account contains enough evidence to cause us to show that the Bible \n        views suicide as the tragic, if not clearly unethical, conclusion to the \n        life of a biblical character portrayed as someone <i>not</i> to imitate. \n        When taken in conjunction with other explicit teachings and broad themes \n        in the Bible, these stories supplement the biblical position that suicide \n        and assisted suicide are unethical.  \n      </p><p><b>Biblical Suicide Accounts </b> \n      </p><p><b>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</b>The \n        book of Judges contains the first two suicide accounts. This book covers \n        an important transitional phase for the nation of Israel between the early \n        leadership of Moses and Joshua and the later kings. The interim rulers \n        were called judges, charismatic military leaders who often freed Israel \n        from invading nations. While some have claimed the book of Judges is a \n        potpourri of stories, recent scholarship views it as a highly structured \n        narrative unit.<sup><a name=\"Ref36\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note36\"><sup>[36]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        An organizing central theme in Judges is the gradual worsening of the \n        moral climate in Israel during this period. The author of Judges believed \n        only a king will rectify the situation, as revealed by the refrain repeated \n        four times in the closing chapters: \"In those days Israel had no \n        king.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref37\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note37\"><sup>[37]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n         \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The stories of the individual \n        judges demonstrate dramatically why this conclusion is justified. The \n        early judges are raised up by God and bring peace to the land for 40 or \n        80 years. After the death of each judge, Israel returns to idolatry and \n        is conquered by a foreign nation, thus necessitating another liberator. \n        However, with the fourth judge, Gideon, things start to get even worse. \n        While his reign begins well, and Israel achieves peace, the people drift \n        away from God earlier than with previous judges. Idolatry returns to the \n        land even before his death.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Gideon is succeeded by his \n        son Abimelech who becomes the first biblical character to commit suicide.<sup><a name=\"Ref38\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note38\"><sup>[38]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        His reign accelerates the demise of Israel. Rather than being called by \n        God as a judge, he seizes power by conspiracy, killing his seventy half-brothers \n        \"on one stone.\" His reign is never secure, lasting only three \n        years. Abimelech's story reveals a literary structure with a clear theological \n        message. The evil which Abimelech does in the first half of the story \n        befalls him in the second half. As a result of a conspiracy, Abimelech \n        is mortally wounded by a large stone hurled upon him by a woman. At his \n        request, his armor bearer runs him through with his sword. He dies beside \n        the stone that crushed his skull, just as he killed his half-brothers \n        on a stone.<sup><a name=\"Ref39\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note39\"><sup>[39]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        The account explains that this was God's punishment for his evil.<sup><a name=\"Ref40\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note40\"><sup>[40]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        Abimelech's story is a turning point in Judges. The land has no rest during \n        his dominion, but, more significantly, the enemy is not a foreign army; \n        it is within Israel. There is nothing laudable in Abimelech's actions, \n        neither in his leadership nor in his death.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Four more judges follow \n        Abimelech, with the situation degenerating into civil war under Jephthah. \n        Then comes Samson's story<sup><a name=\"Ref41\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note41\"><sup>[41]</sup></a>&#xA0;, \n        which \"is both a tragedy and a heroic folk narrative. The hero is \n        both criticized and celebrated. As a result, most episodes are presented \n        in an ambivalent light, depending on whether an event is viewed from the \n        perspective of Samson as a tragic figure or a folk hero.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref42\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note42\"><sup>[42]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        What is clear about Samson, though, is that he never lived up to his spiritual \n        potential. He is yet another stepping stone along Israel's descending \n        path into immorality and idolatry, in spite of God's continued attempts \n        to lead in a different direction.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Samson's birth is foretold \n        in a way the Bible reserves for only pivotal characters.<sup><a name=\"Ref43\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note43\"><sup>[43]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        He is given amazing strength by God, but ignores his commandments. Israel \n        knows no peace during his reign. At various points he kills numerous Philistines, \n        but some sort of trickery or sexual immorality taints every episode. He \n        dies when he pulls a house down upon himself and thousands of Philistines. \n        Yet it was his sexual lust and teasing trickery with Delilah which got \n        him captured in the first place. As with any tragic figure, his death \n        is understandable, and even accomplishes good. Yet it is not thereby commended \n        since it was precipitated by his own character weaknesses.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;For Christians, Samson is \n        an ambiguous character since the New Testament lists him as an example \n        of someone who lived by faith in God.<sup><a name=\"Ref44\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note44\"><sup>[44]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        Of all the suicides in the Bible his is an exception because it simultaneously \n        led to the destruction of numerous enemies of Israel. As such it certainly \n        could be viewed more like the sacrificial death of a wartime hero, if \n        not even an instance of martyrdom. However, all Samson's actions are not \n        thereby condoned. Early rabbinical commentary on Samson and the legendary \n        warriors of Israel noted that while the accomplishments of these heroes \n        can be admired, they are not to be emulated. These \"dangerous heroes\" \n        frequently used their God-given abilities in ways which did not please \n        God.<sup><a name=\"Ref45\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note45\"><sup>[45]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n         \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Samson shows that God can \n        accomplish his purposes <i>in spite of </i>his chosen representatives. \n        This is another unifying theme in the book of Judges, and continues into \n        the books of Samuel. Even though humans do not live up to their spiritual \n        potential, or do not live according to God's ways, his will can be accomplished. \n        God remains in control of the situation. Although Samson did not have \n        God's intentions in mind, God used him to judge the Philistines. But it \n        was only through his death that God started the liberation of Israel. \n        Rather than commending suicide, Samson's death is the tragic conclusion \n        to a life which never bore the fruit it could. As such, it fits the pattern \n        revealed throughout the book of Judges:  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;From Abimelech's time on, \n        the land does not recover its peace; deliverance is less complete; Jephthah \n        fails where Gideon succeeded in avoiding civil war. If the Samson episode \n        is regarded as part of the central theme--and this is implied by 10:7-9--then \n        at the very end there is lacking something which is normally regarded \n        as basic to this theme; for Samson is a judge in Israel, but he does not \n        effect any real liberation from the foreign enemy.<sup><a name=\"Ref46\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note46\"><sup>[46]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n         \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The book of Judges concludes \n        that a king is needed to bring spiritual, moral, and political stability \n        to Israel. Saul becomes the first king, but not before God warns that \n        Israel's desire for a human king is, in fact, a rejection of God's kingship.<sup><a name=\"Ref47\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note47\"><sup>[47]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        The character traits of the nation's leader become a central theme in \n        the books of Samuel. But rather than listing required character qualities \n        and legislating what the king must be like, in the Bible \"the portrayal \n        of character is most often achieved though a variety of implicit, or indirect, \n        means.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref48\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note48\"><sup>[48]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        A frequently used method in Samuel is to contrast a person with a certain \n        character quality to one without it. According to one scholar, the narrator \n        \"is a master of indirect characterization through comparison and \n        contrast.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref49\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note49\"><sup>[49]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n         \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;As the story develops, Saul \n        becomes more and more alienated from God, his family, and his people. \n        Saul brings David into his inner circle, and the narrator uses David's \n        moral character to comment negatively on Saul's. As David becomes more \n        successful, Saul becomes obsessed with jealousy towards him. He makes \n        numerous attempts on David's life, while in contrast, David refuses to \n        kill Saul when two opportunities present themselves. David's respect for \n        the life of the Lord's anointed prevents him from killing the one who \n        unjustly seeks his life. When Saul lies wounded on the battlefield, he \n        has no one to turn to for help because of his earlier decisions. He cannot \n        (or will not) turn to God. Death is the only answer. In a final character \n        contrast, Saul's armor-bearer refuses to help him die, although he immediately \n        thereafter kills himself. Saul is completely isolated. He turns and falls \n        on his own sword. The tragic hero is dead.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Saul's suicide is not an \n        isolated incident without moral comment. It is the tragic conclusion to \n        a literary masterpiece soaked with moral comments. Tragedy implies that \n        what is, ought not to be.<sup><a name=\"Ref50\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note50\"><sup>[50]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        Saul's hunger for control puts him on the battlefield alienated from God, \n        family, and friends. Killing himself fits his frequent use of death to \n        deal with his problems. To claim that Saul's story commends suicide is \n        to misinterpret completely the purpose of tragic narrative. As understandable \n        as his suicide is, it remains a tragic conclusion that should never have \n        happened.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;However, the Saul narrative \n        does not end here. David gets news of the battlefield disaster from an \n        Amalekite soldier who claimed Saul persuaded him to assist his suicide \n        because he was in great pain and couldn't live anyway.<sup><a name=\"Ref51\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note51\"><sup>[51]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        The differences in these accounts are not explained. David is outraged \n        at the Amalekite since he was not afraid \"to kill the Lord's anointed \n        one.\" Therefore, the Amalekite deserves to die, and David has him \n        executed. The structure here both affirms the armor-bearer's refusal to \n        assist Saul's suicide, and alludes to the general prohibition against \n        murder: \"Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be \n        shed; for in the image of God has God made man.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref52\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note52\"><sup>[52]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n         \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;In condemning the Amalekite, \n        David, a man whose heart was close to God's, implicitly condemned Saul's \n        suicide, since he thereby killed the Lord's anointed one. In building \n        to the climax of this story, the wrongness of killing the Lord's anointed \n        one is stated five times.<sup><a name=\"Ref53\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note53\"><sup>[53]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        Repetition is one of the most common literary methods used in Hebrew narrative \n        to stress an important theme. In the middle of this section, an apparently \n        unrelated story is inserted about David setting out to kill Nabal, a man \n        who had refused to help David and his men. Persuaded against killing him, \n        Nabal dies of illness shortly afterwards. David expresses how thankful \n        he is that he did not kill Nabal himself, but left matters in God's hands.<sup><a name=\"Ref54\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note54\"><sup>[54]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        David later elaborates that he must allow Saul's death to occur in God's \n        time in God's way.<sup><a name=\"Ref55\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note55\"><sup>[55]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        These incidences declare the importance of leaving death in God's hands, \n        something Saul refused to do.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;When the Bible later comments \n        on Saul's death, the literary structure again points to a negative evaluation.<sup><a name=\"Ref56\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note56\"><sup>[56]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        \"The repetition of the death motif gives a clue that the Chronicler \n        wanted his readers to focus on the significance of Saul's disgraceful \n        death. . . .The Chronicler intended to teach how Saul's ignominious death \n        demonstrated God's utter rejection of Saul and the exaltation of David's \n        line.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref57\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note57\"><sup>[57]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        Rather than Saul dying the noble death of a wounded warrior, the biblical \n        perspective is that everything about that fateful battle should be viewed \n        in a negative light.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;A similar analysis of all \n        the other suicide accounts reveals a consistent pattern. Nowhere is suicide \n        praised or commended. In fact, the lack of explicit comment on the suicides \n        could just as easily be viewed as a negative evaluation.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The Hebrew Bible has no \n        praise for Saul and his armor-bearer who committed suicide rather than \n        risk capture by the Philistines. Significantly, David's lament for Saul \n        and Jonathan makes no mention of Saul's suicide so as to avoid death at \n        the hands of the Philistines. Saul and Jonathan's bravery come in for \n        due praise, but there is not a word of tribute to the heroism of Saul's \n        death.<sup><a name=\"Ref58\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note58\"><sup>[58]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n         \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;In fact, almost all of those \n        who committed suicide are given explicitly negative character evaluations \n        in the Bible.<sup><a name=\"Ref59\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note59\"><sup>[59]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        The only exceptions are Samson, who is ambiguous at best, and Saul's armor-bearer, \n        who plays only an incidental role in the plot. As the Saul narrative reaches \n        its climax, David reminds Saul of an old proverb claiming that evil actions \n        come from evil people.<sup><a name=\"Ref60\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note60\"><sup>[60]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        If the way of life of those who committed suicide is not to be imitated, \n        surely it follows their way of dying should not be imitated either.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The lives of these anti-heroes \n        must also be contrasted with the lives of biblical heroes. Many great \n        men and women of the Bible (like Rachel, Moses, Elijah, and Paul) reflected \n        on the preferability of death over life.<sup><a name=\"Ref61\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note61\"><sup>[61]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        Yet they did not choose to kill themselves. Some of them even prayed that \n        God would kill them, but they accepted his timing. Never did He grant \n        them their request at that time. These characters demonstrate the Bible's \n        view that God is the only one who should determine when we die.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Many of these biblical characters \n        speak openly about the reality of their suffering, yet they turn to God \n        for help in dealing with their pain. Job is held up as the example of \n        patient endurance of suffering.<sup><a name=\"Ref62\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note62\"><sup>[62]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        He experienced horrendous pain, illness, and loss. He wanted to die, but \n        chose not to take his life in his own hands because of his trust in God.<sup><a name=\"Ref63\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note63\"><sup>[63]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        The language in the latter passage is closely followed by Paul when he \n        reflects on whether life or death is preferable for him.<sup><a name=\"Ref64\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note64\"><sup>[64]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        In coming to his decision, Paul brings up another biblical theme: putting \n        the needs of others before one's own. As much as Paul wanted to be with \n        the Lord, his call to serve others in this world made life \"more \n        necessary.\" Even in suffering and dying, Christians are called upon \n        to find ways to serve others.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;In the New Testament suicide \n        is not explicitly discussed. The suicide of Judas Iscariot is recorded \n        without comment.

The New Testament offers a way of life and a set of values which \n        call for hope and contentment in life in spite of pain and suffering. \n        It stresses the value of every individual and the role each can play in \n        this world. It offers a way to live with suffering, knowing that the afterlife \n        will have none. But it also teaches that God's sovereignty extends to \n        people's bodies and their lives. Paul declares to his fellow Christians \n        \"You do not belong to yourself, for God bought you with a high price. \n        So you must honor God with your body.\"<sup><a name=\"Ref69\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note69\"><sup>[69]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        As we shall now see, the earliest Christians regarded suicide as incompatible \n        with this perspective.  \n      </p><p><b>Christian Martyrdom </b> \n      </p><p><b>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</b>Christianity \n        has not taught that death should be feared and avoided at all costs. Indeed, \n        a tenacious clinging to life has typically been seen as the result of \n        misplaced priorities for a Christian. Furthermore, a balancing theme is \n        the willingness to die for the good of others or to accept death as a \n        martyr if the only alternative is to deny one's faith. Yet some cases \n        of Jewish and Christian 'martyrdom' seem more like suicides, and probably \n        should be labeled as such.<sup><a name=\"Ref70\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note70\"><sup>[70]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        However, a few scholars would like to use this small number of examples \n        to blur the distinction between martyrdom and suicide, and condone both. \n        Upon these scholars Judges Kaufman and Reinhardt relied. Hence, an examination \n        of the early church's response to martyrdom is needed.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Christians have reacted \n        to persecution in five different ways: 1) accepting whatever penalties \n        were inflicted, including death; 2) avoiding martyrdom through, for example, \n        bribery or forged documents; 3) fleeing; 4) volunteering for or provoking \n        martyrdom; and 5) apostatizing. The first of these was always approved \n        and the fifth always condemned during the patristic period.<sup><a name=\"Ref71\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note71\"><sup>[71]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        The second, third, and fourth were much more problematic and evoked considerable \n        disagreement within the Christian community especially between rigorists \n        and moderates.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The preponderance of known \n        cases of martyrdom that occurred before the legalization of Christianity \n        in 313 are of those who did not actively seek martyrdom but, when arrested, \n        were martyred rather than avoid death through apostasy, bribery, or forged \n        documents. Some, when seeing others being interrogated, tortured, or executed, \n        identified themselves as Christians and suffered the consequences. The \n        latter varied from the theatrically eager to the resigned. Certainly, \n        some actively sought to provoke pagans to martyr them. However, indisputable \n        examples of such are extremely rare. The tiny number of Christians who \n        are recorded as actively taking their own lives did so only under extreme \n        duress. They fall into three categories:  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;1. Those who killed themselves \n        to avoid excruciating torture. Only one instance appears in the sources.<sup><a name=\"Ref72\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note72\"><sup>[72]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n        Augustine's thorough analyses of suicide make no reference to this category \n        in pagan or Christian literature.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;2. Those who dramatically \n        ended their lives after being arrested but before being executed. Two \n        examples are recorded.<sup><a name=\"Ref73\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note73\"><sup>[73]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n         \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;3. Virgins and married women \n        who killed themselves to escape defilement. The earliest examples appear \n        to be from the \"Great Persecution\" (303-311), but were also \n        of concern about a century later when the Goths sacked Rome, raping pagan \n        and Christian women.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Leaving aside these three \n        categories of suicide that arise in the context of persecution or in the \n        face of immanent ravishing by barbarians, we should emphasize that there \n        was considerable disagreement within the Christian community regarding \n        the proper response to persecution. On the one hand, rigorists (a minority \n        in our sources) volunteered for, and sometimes provoked, martyrdom. On \n        the other hand, moderates (a strong majority in our sources) advocated \n        fleeing in the face of persecution. All Christians held that martyrdom \n        was the most perfect display of love toward God and was desired above \n        any other form of death. No other death provided the spiritual glory and \n        rewards that martyrdom guaranteed.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Therefore, for rigorists, \n        suicide would be an obstacle to the most cherished form of death, martyrdom. \n        For moderates, the very basis of their condemnation of seeking or provoking \n        martyrdom would <i>eo ipso </i>preclude approving of intentionally ending \n        one's own life by one's own hand, much less formulating a theological \n        justification for suicide. Not surprisingly, we do not know of even one \n        instance of Christians committing suicide after being refused martyrdom \n        in all extant literature written before the legalization of Christianity. \n         \n      </p><p><b>Patristic Sources on Suicide </b> \n      </p><p><b>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</b>In \n        contrast to Judge Reinhardt's assertion, no evidence appears to exist \n        of any Christian during the patristic period committing suicide, in the \n        ordinary sense of the word, to accelerate entrance into heaven. Furthermore, \n        suicide was clearly condemned by church fathers before and contemporary \n        with Augustine (354-430). Some examples will suffice here to show the \n        consistency of this position.

The first installment of this massive work was published in \n        414, four years after the Goths captured and ravaged Rome, raping pagan \n        and Christian women alike.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Augustine condemned the \n        following motivations for suicide: 1) because of guilt over past sins; \n        2) because of a desire for heaven; 3) to avoid or escape from temporal \n        problems; 4) to avoid or escape from another's sinful actions (including \n        doing so to preserve chastity); and 5) to avoid sinning. The only conceivably \n        justifiable cause for suicide, Augustine said, would be the last, yet \n        even the sin of such a well-motivated suicide would be greater than any \n        sin that one might avoid by killing oneself. The basis for his condemnation \n        was fourfold:  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;1. Scripture does not expressly \n        permit, much less command, suicide as a means of achieving heaven or as \n        a way to escape or avoid evil.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;2. A prohibition of suicide \n        is explicit in the sixth commandment (\"Thou shalt not kill\"). \n         \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;3. Since no private party \n        has the authority to kill a criminal who deserves capital punishment, \n        those who kill themselves are homicides.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;4. Suicide allows no opportunity \n        for repentance.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;His only reference to martyrdom \n        in this digression on suicide was his refutation of pagan approval of \n        suicide to avoid captivity. He argued that the patriarchs, prophets, and \n        apostles did not commit suicide to escape persecution or martyrdom. About \n        a decade before he published the first installment of the <i>City of God</i>, \n        Augustine addressed martyrdom, but not that of Christians persecuted by \n        pagans. Rather, he condemned the courting of martyrdom by, and the theatrically \n        spectacular suicides of, the Donatists, a schismatic, heretical group.<sup><a name=\"Ref84\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note84\"><sup>[84]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n         \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The Donatist movement began \n        in the early fourth century when rigorists condemned the church's accepting \n        back into fellowship those who had apostatized during the \"Great \n        Persecution.\" Donatists viewed themselves as upholders of the purity \n        of discipline in the face of \"compromise with the world.\" From \n        its beginning, the movement was a thorn in the flesh for the church leadership, \n        resulting in persecution by the church and the imperial government in \n        317. In 415, the death penalty was enacted for Donatists who continued \n        to assemble. It was especially then that some Donatists, primarily a fringe \n        group known as the Circumcellions, increased their indiscriminate as well \n        as systematic acts of violence against orthodox Christians (even once \n        attempting to ambush and kill Augustine) and even provoked the authorities \n        to put them to death.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;For nearly twenty years, \n        Augustine periodically composed anti-Donatist treatises. A frequent focus \n        of these was the Donatists' attitude toward and practice of suicide, which \n        was sometimes sensationalistic. Space permits only a brief summary of \n        the major themes in his anti-Donatist writings that do not occur in the \n        <i>City of God</i>:  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;1. Provoking martyrdom is \n        a form of suicide and hence a sin.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;2. \"Heroic\" suicide \n        by those who fail to provoke others to martyr them is a sin.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;3. The Donatists' suicides \n        violate the foundational Christian principle of patient endurance (presented \n        in one of his last anti-Donatist writings (<i>Letters</i> 204) composed \n        in 420).  \n      </p><p>In 415 Augustine wrote a treatise chiding the Donatists \n        with the example of Job:  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;At him let those men look \n        who bring death upon themselves when they are being sought out to be given \n        life, and who, by taking away their present life, reject also the life \n        to come. For, if they were being forced to deny Christ or to do anything \n        contrary to justice, they ought, as true martyrs, to bear all things patiently \n        rather than to inflict death upon themselves in their impatience. If he \n        could have done it righteously to escape evil, holy Job would have destroyed \n        himself so that he might have escaped such diabolic cruelty in his own \n        possessions, in his own sons, in his own limbs.<sup><a name=\"Ref85\"></a></sup><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/suicide.htm#Note85\"><sup>[85]</sup></a>&#xA0; \n         \n      </p><p>Patient endurance will prove to be the climax of Augustine's \n        final statement on the subject of suicide, in book nineteen of the <i>City \n        of God</i>, published in 426 or 427.  \n      </p><p><b>Patristic Sources on Suffering </b> \n      </p><p><b>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</b>Patient \n        endurance was not, of course, a theme unique to Augustine.

This conviction, along with an \n        unwavering belief in divine sovereignty, and an equally solid confidence \n        that God does all things for the ultimate good of his people endued them \n        with a sense of responsibility to practice endurance in the face of all \n        afflictions.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Cyprian (ca.200-258) is \n        an excellent, but not atypical, example.

Christians are passive--they \n        are being liberated; they are being delivered; they are being rescued; \n        they are being brought. It is God who is the active party. Christians \n        are to yearn for heaven and to pray for an early departure from life. \n        Yearning for death and praying to die are categorically different from \n        taking one's own life. There is no place for suicide here. Patient endurance \n        of all tribulation, steadfastness to the end, final submission to God's \n        will under those very afflictions that God is using to refine and perfect \n        the Christian: such faith is antithetical to suicide.

Martyrdom, however, did. As we have seen, the probity of provoking \n        or volunteering for martyrdom was hotly disputed before the legalization \n        of Christianity. Why did suicide not stimulate controversy within the \n        Christian community? Surely not because the church fathers were reluctant \n        to condemn sin and to confront their fellow Christians for their moral \n        failings. The absence of controversy regarding suicide does not suggest \n        that Christians were indifferent to suicide as an ethical issue. It simply \n        appears not to have been a sufficiently attractive and viable option for \n        them to have regarded it as a threat to the moral integrity of the Christian \n        community.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The condemnations of suicide \n        that we encounter prior to Augustine's time are comparatively rare because \n        they are not part of Christians' broad moral indignation against pagan \n        depravity. Their outrage, especially against abortion and infanticide, \n        was greatly stimulated by the perceived helplessness of the victim, whether \n        a fetus or an infant. So also with gladiatorial combat and viciously cruel \n        forms of torture and execution. Even acts of sexual immorality were more \n        severely condemned when slaves were forced to be the objects of their \n        owners' lusts or their greed when forced into prostitution for their owners' \n        profit. The moral indignation of Christian authors was especially provoked \n        by the helplessness of the victims of others' sins. Suicide, as practiced \n        by pagans, simply did not arouse passionate condemnation, for it was not \n        an act in which an innocent party was victimized.  \n      </p><p><b>Conclusion </b> \n      </p><p><b>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</b>Early \n        Christians lived in a secular milieu in which suicide by the ill was frequently \n        practiced and its probity seldom questioned. Yet patristic literature \n        has no record of ill Christians committing suicide or asking others' assistance \n        to do so. Neither do we have records of people requesting others to kill \n        them to escape the grinding tedium of chronic illness or the severe suffering \n        of terminal illness. Christianity introduced moral obligations that were \n        altogether foreign to the Greek and Roman ethos. One of these was a duty \n        to care--not a duty to cure, but a duty to care--an obligation to extend \n        practical compassion to the destitute, the widow, the orphan, and the \n        sick. This introduced a truly radical transformation in attitudes toward \n        the sick.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Patristic literature addresses \n        only three ethical issues raised by illness: the tendency of some Christians \n        to seek medical care without first pondering the spiritual dimensions \n        of their suffering; the use of pagan or magical healing alternatives; \n        and the occasionally frantic struggles to find and cling to even meager \n        hope of recovery. There is not a scintilla of evidence that the preferential \n        position that Christianity gave to the sick included an expedited \"final \n        exit.\"  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;While the Bible does not \n        explicitly condemn suicide, it nowhere explicitly condones it either. \n        Those whose suicides are recorded in the Bible are clearly presented as \n        characters not to be emulated. Their suicides may be understandable, but \n        they are narratively structured as yet another in a series of wrong decisions \n        made by unethical characters.  \n      </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Suicide and assisted suicide \n        are incompatible with a number of biblical teachings. So foundational \n        are the goodness of God and his sovereignty in patristic theology, and \n        patient endurance of affliction so stressed as an essential Christian \n        virtue, that we should not be surprised that patristic texts are void \n        of any reference to suicide by the ill. Scripture and early church history \n        do not condone suicide or assisted suicide. They should not be distorted \n        to provide support for the legalization of physician-assisted suicide. \n      </p><p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/donal/articles.htm\">Go to the Publications Page</a> \n      </p>\n      <p><a name=\"Note1\"><sup><sup>[</sup></sup></a><sup><sup>1]</sup></sup><a name=\"Note1\"><sup> \n        </sup></a>&#xA0;<i>See</i> Vacco v.

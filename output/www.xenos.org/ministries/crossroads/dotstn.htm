In other words, once we say there are exceptions to laws like \n          non-contradiction in one case, we must allow that other exceptions may \n          exist in other areas.

Christianity is a personal \n          relationship with God through Jesus Christ, and a relationship, to be \n          personal, must be an experience. However, experience isn't what makes \n          Christianity true. God's truth is true regardless of what I experience. \n          Experience might help to <b>verify</b> the truth to me as one line of \n          evidence.

Later, I discover that the \n          text he relied on actually means something else in context. At that \n          point, I should judge my experience as mistaken, no matter how pleasurable. \n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>The postmodern religionists says, \"My experience is the basis \n          for my beliefs, and those beliefs exist to empower me.\" Formulate \n          a similar statement from the perspective of a biblical Christian: </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Possible answers: [<u><i>God's word or ultimate reality</i></u>] \n          is the basis for my beliefs, and those beliefs exist [<u><i>because \n          they are true</i></u>] </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>The authors claim that the church has lost the loyalty of a huge number \n          of people during our lifetime.

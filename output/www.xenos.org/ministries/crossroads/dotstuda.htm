O'Math&#xFA;na </h5>\n      \n      <h2>Introduction</h2>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>Western people in the 1990's are experiencing the most sweeping shift \n          in perspective since the enlightenment. <i>The Death of Truth</i> details \n          the dramatic and earth-shaking conversion of western society from the \n          modernist world view to the postmodern world view. No book can take \n          you more quickly and painlessly into the heart of the new postmodern \n          outlook than <i>The Death of Truth</i>. You will feel the lights going \n          on time after time as you read this easy-to-understand volume </p>\n        <p>This Study Guide is designed to help groups discuss the book section \n          by section as members read through it on their own. Each week, appoint \n          one discussion facilitator. The facilitator needs to carefully read \n          the section in<i> The Death of Truth</i> for that week, and look over \n          the discussion questions and suggested answers in the facilitator's \n          guide ahead of time in order to offer leading thoughts. For each week, \n          we have provided more material than you will likely be able to cover. \n          Therefore, the facilitator should select the questions for study each \n          weak. Avoid lecture, except for short 2 to 3 minute explanations or \n          transitions. If people discuss and struggle with these concepts they \n          will feel more satisfaction and depth in their learning. </p>\n        <p>Encourage every participant to buy his or her own copy of <i>The Death \n          of Truth</i>, (couples can share) and to bring them to your meetings. \n          <i>The Death of Truth</i> is published by Bethany House Publishers, \n          and is available through any bookstore, especially Christian bookstores. \n          Discounted copies are also available from our Worldwide Web Site at \n          http://www.crossrds.org. When the guide says to read a section from \n          the book, ask one of the members to read aloud, while the others follow \n          along. Reading is an easy way to help start people speaking and participating. \n        </p>\n        <p>As written, this study could take 15 to 20 weeks to complete. If you \n          want to shorten the number of weeks, we recommend skipping some of the \n          \"Postmodern Impact\" chapters. We do not recommend skipping \n          the first three or the last two chapters. </p>\n        <p>We have arranged each week's study so you can copy the \"Discussion \n          Guide\" for your group members while giving only the facilitator \n          the \"Facilitator's guide\" which includes suggested answers. \n          Questions asking only for personal opinion have been left without suggested \n          answers. </p>\n        <p>The entire discussion guide is copyrighted, but you may copy it for \n          non-commercial study purposes provided you copy and distribute at least \n          whole weekly sections unaltered, and give credit to the authors. You \n          may also get a <b>FREE</b> copy of the guide on-line for use in your \n          word processor at our Worldwide Web Site. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      \n      <h2>Chapter 1; <br>\n        Are We Ready?</h2>\n      <h2>Discussion Guide</h2>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>Have group members read, one paragraph each, through the first section \n          (up to The New Revolution).

The cultural deficit model as described \n          by Sleeter and Grant (1990) assumes that schools should change learners, \n          should help them assimilate to mainstream culture, including the \"culture \n          of science.\" From this viewpoint, children need remedial work to \n          compensate for their lack of knowledge, skills, and attitudes in science \n          and mathematics. Those who advocate the use of this world view regard \n          students as being \"at risk\" when they do not share American \n          mainstream language and culture.

If \n          one adopts this world view, children who speak a primary language other \n          than English are considered an asset in the classroom because they have \n          constructed a knowledge of science in a different sociocultural context \n          than others in the class and thus bring added resources to the classroom. \n          Those who advocate the use of a multicultural approach to education \n          see diversity as a strength in the classroom, as a vehicle for increasing \n          the learning of all students. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>What postmodern theories and attitudes are evident in this passage? \n        </li>\n        <li>Is it true that sometimes, or all the time, that students do not succeed \n          because of differences between their culture and \"school culture\"? \n          Are there other reasons for why some students might not succeed? </li>\n        <li>For someone who does not believe that the schools should \"change \n          learners,\" what, then, would the school's job be?

Other \n          Christians hold that \"value-free\" education is impossible. \n          For example, forbidding cheating, requiring academic performance, etc. \n          are necessary for the educational process, but they are values/ethics. \n          What place do you think values, religious/philosophical beliefs, and \n          ethics have in public education? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>This is a very difficult issue.

When there was a Judeo-Christian consensus \n          in our culture, it was much easier to trust that the values taught in \n          public schools were for the most part biblical. As our culture becomes \n          truly post-Christian, the amount of common ground in values and ethics \n          has shrunken dramatically.Ideally, a local community could delineate \n          the values on which there is large agreement, and then agree to emphasize \n          these values in the school system. Communities that have done this have \n          been pleasantly surprised at how much consensus is possible (e.g., honesty, \n          diligence, respect for authority, etc.). Where no consensus is possible, \n          they could agree to avoid those issues in lower grades and try to give \n          a balanced treatment of the different views in higher grades. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>What are the similarities and differences between the postmodernists' \n          espousal of Afrocentric schools and Christians' espousal of Christian \n          schools? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Christian schools are privately funded </p>\n        <p>- Christian schools are not based on race but on a religious point \n          of view </p>\n        <p>- Christian schools are often open to non-Christians </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Consider the following passage by a science educator and then give \n          your opinion on the questions that follow: </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>\"The study. . .[see Discussion Guide] </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>What postmodern ideas are evident in this passage? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Science and technology are western cultural biases. </p>\n        <p>- Rationality and linear thinking is male. </p>\n        <p>- Whether a particular scientific proposition is true or false is never \n          considered--only that it reflects male European thinking. </p>\n        <p>- Competition and individual achievement are European and male. </p>\n        <p>- Belief that there is a real objective world is male and European \n        </p>\n        <p>- According to postmodernists, androcentric instructional models are \n          those which focus on \"male\" or <i>individual</i> ways of knowing \n          and doing things.

How is feminism different from the concerns of women? \n        </li>\n        <li>Clearly, feminism is a type of affirmative postmodernism. The ideological \n          approach to truth is clear in all of feminist literature, especially \n          among feminist theologians. They start from the perspective of what \n          they conceive to be \"women's experience.\" Read the following \n          quotes from the chapter: </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>\"By women's experience as a key to hermeneutics or theory of interpretation, \n          we mean precisely that experience which arises when women become critically \n          aware of these falsifying and alienating experiences imposed upon them \n          as women by a male-dominated culture.\" </p>\n        <p>\"All women live with male violence . . .\" </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Do you think that this is an appropriate place to begin forming an \n          approach to reading the Bible?

It is simply a matter of there being no turning \n          back. We can be dispossessed of our best insights, proven wrong in our \n          judgments. But as long as those insights continue to make sense to us, \n          and as long as our basic judgments seem to us incontrovertible, there \n          can be no turning back.

Note that the notion \n          of objective truth is linked to the \"correspondence theory of truth.\" \n          That is, my thought is true when it corresponds to external reality. \n          Note also that this is the Bible's own definition of truth. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Have you ever heard an evangelical Christian question whether reason \n          applies to the things of God? </li>\n        <li>What do you think of one who holds that reason applies part of the \n          time, but not all the time? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Anyone who claims that reason does not apply to some part of his \n          own position is guilty of the logical fallacy called \"special pleading.\" \n          He is pleading for a rule to apply to his argument that he will not \n          allow for other arguments. In other words, if we think reason doesn't \n          apply to some areas, we are forced to admit it may not apply to any \n          area. If so, we can no longer use reason to refute any argument. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Have you ever felt personally embarrassed by the absolute truth claims \n          of Christianity? If so, what should you do? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Discuss ways to soften the blow without compromising the truth. This \n          is called \"tact\" in communication, and many Christians could \n          use more of it. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Do you think the church today is too \"left-brained?\" Or \n          do you agree with McCallum that most Christian people are insufficiently \n          sophisticated in their theological thinking? </li>\n        <li>McCallum thinks, \"Reason is <i>reliable</i>, but not <i>sufficient</i>. \n          As biblical Christians, we believe reason can tell us much about the \n          world, but not everything. We also need revelation.\" Can we hold \n          to knowledge that goes beyond reason without denying the validity of \n          reason? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Yes, we can. Do you know how the copier in your office works? Perhaps \n          not. Do you know what the future holds? Definitely not.

So, too, God may \n          be beyond our comprehension, but this does not mean he is irrational. \n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <h5>Postmodern vs. Christian Views on Culture </h5>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Missions experts are concerned today about \"contextualization\"--adapting \n          Christianity to other cultures, and avoiding exporting western cultural \n          features to other non-western cultures. How would you differentiate \n          between postmodern views on culturally constructed reality and appropriate \n          biblical contextualization? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Contextualization means we dress and speak in ways compatible with \n          another culture <i>in order</i> to bring them the universal truth of \n          the Gospel. Postmodernists deny there are universal truths. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>McCallum says, \"Christians have no debate with the observation \n          that people usually adopt their culture's point of view. Our problem \n          is with the postmodern position that they <i>have no choice in this</i>, \n          because they are imprisoned in the reality constructed by their language \n          and culture. We must reject cultural determinism.\" Do you agree \n          with this? Why, or why not? What difference would it make if we adopted \n          one or the other view on this question? Can you think of any biblical \n          material on Christ and other cultures? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- The idea that people are conditioned by their culture flies directly \n          in the face of the notion of universal judgment. It also renders Christian \n          missions pointless. Consider how Paul, Abraham, Jesus and others defied \n          their cultures to set forward new understandings based on revelation. \n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\"The truth stands <i>over</i> culture, as its judge, not <i>under</i> \n          culture as its product.\" Give some examples of how this statement \n          might work in real life. </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- This is a very important truth. How would we know that slavery was \n          wrong?

How, then, can \n          Christians claim texts have objective, fixed messages we must discover? \n        </li>\n        <li>Under reader-centered postmodern hermeneutics, readers are free to \n          generate new meaning in biblical texts. Therefore, McCallum claims, \n          \"they are in the position formerly occupied by God--that of revealer \n          and source of truth.\" Is this statement too hard? </li>\n        <li>Discuss the difference between <i>interpretation </i>and <i>application \n          </i>of Scripture. How does this distinction relate to the idea of reader-response \n          hermeneutics? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Interpretation is a matter of what the author intended to communicate. \n          Application is a matter of how God wants to apply the word to my life. \n          The former is objective. The latter is subjective. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>McCallum says, \"Postmodernists aren't wrong in everything they \n          say, but their fundamental thrust is completely wrong and incompatible \n          with biblical Christianity.\" Is this statement too strong?

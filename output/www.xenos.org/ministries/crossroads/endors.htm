What \n                is it?How does it effect health care, education, science, law, \n                history, philosophy, psychotherapy and religion? This book is \n                a tour de force, tackling a vast array of implications not just \n                for the way we think but the way we live. An excellent introduction \n                to a complex cultural phenomenon. You'll be wiser for reading \n                it. If you read it carefully, a lot wiser.</p>\n              <p><strong><a name=\"DDE_LINK1\">Norman \n                Geisler, Ph.

Most works exposing its dangers are \n                heavily philosophical and difficult to understand. The Death of \n                Truth is the best I have seen in its readability and depth of \n                penetration. I highly recommend it!\"</p>\n              <p><strong>Francis Beckwith, \n                Ph.D.<br>\n                Author of Politically Correct Death, Lecturer, Philosophy, UNLV</strong><br>\n                \"In the past, opponents of Christianity charged that it was \n                a false religion. Now opponents hold that Christianity ought not \n                to be believed because its followers claim it is true. This is \n                the posture of our postmodern age, a posture traditional Christian \n                apologists are not prepared to confront. This book is on the cutting \n                edge and thus mandatory reading for any Christian who wants to \n                engage this postmodern spirit.

McCallum \n                guides the reader from the birth of modernism into the newer threat \n                of a postmodernistic society. His exhaustive research unearths \n                a frightening assemblage of assaults on simple truth, and his \n                admonitions to the church on how to stand against the evils of \n                postmodernism are timely and most important.\"</p>\n              <p><strong>Hugh Ross, Ph.D.<br>\n                Astro-physicist, Author of Creation and Time, Director, Reasons \n                to Believe</strong><br>\n                \"The Death of Truth is a valuable survey for the everyday \n                reader of postmodernism's impact on society.

This conference and book is going to give \n                you a perspective on how really important postmodernism is. You \n                can read about it, you can discuss it with your friends, but this \n                is an opportunity to hear a series of programs, a series of workshops \n                put together by people who are really digging into understand \n                what the impact of postmodernism is at the present time in our \n                business environment and what it's going to be in the future.\" \n                </p>\n              <p><strong>Kathryn Meeks, \n                <br>\n                Christian Graduate Student</strong><br>\n                \"I was a bit uncomfortable at points, because some of the \n                teachers would say, 'Isn't it obvious that this is wrong?' and \n                I knew that's exactly how I had been thinking.

I think you can see \n                where we are losing ground in our outreach. . . There just is \n                no concept of absolute truth, and this is a conference that addresses \n                that problem. . . and I don't think we have anything else that \n                telling us that right now.\"</p>\n              <p><strong>Scott Collins<br>\n                Computer Scientist</strong><br>\n                \"The Postmodern Challenge conference brought me 3 things: \n                empowerment and encouragement to stand outside of both modernism \n                and postmodernism to examine things realistically. . .

Too often we demand answers to be served to us on a platter. \n                'Just tell me what I should say if my friend says this.'

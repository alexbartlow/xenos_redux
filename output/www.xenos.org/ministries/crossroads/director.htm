I am the director of The Crossroads Project, an \n              apologetics ministry designed to equip Christians to understand \n              and effectively communicate to our postmodern culture. I lead a \n              team of scholars, researchers and experienced Christian workers \n              who are deeply involved in providing critical and biblical analysis \n              to contemporary secular thought.<br>\n              </td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr> \n            <td width=\"10\"></td>\n            <td width=\"370\" colspan=\"3\">I became a Christian in \n              1976, my first year at The Ohio State University, through the ministry \n              of Xenos Christian Fellowship. I spent the next four years going \n              to school and living in a Christian rooming house, which in those \n              days was the hub of Xenos fellowship activities. Those were formative \n              years for me. I was encouraged to delve deeply into the scripture \n              and serve needs in the fellowship. Through this experience, I cultivated \n              a strong burden for a life of Christian ministry. After completing \n              a BA in philosophy at Ohio State, I went to Trinity Evangelical \n              Divinity School where I received an MA in philosophy of religion. \n              At Trinity I had the opportunity to be mentored by Dr. William Lane \n              Craig, one of today's leading philosophers of religion. Since graduating \n              from Trinity, the Lord has opened many doors for me to teach philosophy \n              and the humanities. Before joining the Xenos staff, I taught at \n              Trinity Evangelical Divinity School (1985), College of Lake County \n              (1985-87), McHenry College (1987) and Columbus State Community College \n              (1988-90). In addition to my work at Xenos, I teach in the philosophy \n              department of Ohio Dominican College (1995-1999).<br>\n              <br>\n              My wife Linda and I are the proud parents of Timothy \n              (age 13) and Amy (age 6). Linda and I lead a home-based outreach \n              and Bible study group. <br>\n              <br>\n              If you have any comments or questions about The Crossroads \n              Project, feel free to e-mail me at <a href=\"mailto:LeffelJ@xenos.org?cc=webmaster@xenos.org\">leffelj@xenos.org</a>. \n              I'm always excited to share what we're doing or just discussing \n              the many challenges witnessing Christians face in today's culture. \n              I'm also available to speak on a variety of topics related to postmodernism \n              and apologetics. \n              <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/vitaejim.htm\">Jim's professional \n                qualifications and experience</a></p>\n              <p><small><small><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/index.htm\">Return to \n                previous page</a> </small></small> \n            </p></td>\n            <td width=\"10\"></td>\n            <td width=\"100\"></td>\n          </tr>\n        </table>\n      </div>\n      </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/_borders/leff100.jpg","title":"Crossroads Project Director","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/director.htm"}

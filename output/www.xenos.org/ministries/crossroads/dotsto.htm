She uses many of the literary tools and concepts we studied in \n        chapter 7 to radically reshape the Christian message. \n      </p><ul>\n        <li>How does the following passage illustrate the postmodern interest \n          in subverting the author's authority? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>\"When we examine its practical effect on the Christian movement, \n          we can see, paradoxically, that the doctrine of the bodily resurrection \n          also serves an essential political function: it legitimizes the authority \n          of certain men who claim to exercise exclusive leadership over the churches.\" \n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>How does the following quote from <i>The Gnostic Gospels</i> provide \n          an example of the postmodern spirituality that's so popular today? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>\"The resurrection, they (Gnostics) insisted, was not a unique \n          event in the past: instead, it symbolized how Christ's presence could \n          be experienced in the present. What mattered was not literal seeing, \n          but spiritual vision.\" </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>What postmodern concepts are contained in this statement? </li>\n        <li>Can you see why this kind of radical reconstruction of Christianity \n          is so popular? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Discussion leader: It's popular because it leaves the individual \n          as the source of truth. No authority outside of the self is ever needed. \n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      \n      <h3>Joseph Campbell</h3>\n      <p>Campbell teaches that the underlying structure of the unconscious mind \n        is based on \"archetypes.\" These archetypes represent our connection \n        with our evolutionary past, and our connection to nature. Religious myth \n        is how we get in touch with this unconscious reality. Ultimate truths \n        about reality end up being truths about ourselves. \n      </p><ul>\n        <li>How does the following quote from The Power of Myth explain the relationship \n          of myth to our true, unconscious self? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>\"All of these wonderful poetic images of mythology are referring \n          to something in you. When your mind is simply trapped by the image out \n          there so that you never make the reference to yourself, you have misread \n          the image . . . Now you can personify God in many, many ways. Is there \n          one god? Are there many gods? Those are merely categories of thought.\" \n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>For Campbell, myth is metaphor. There can be no objective or rational \n          grasp of ultimate truths. That's what he means when he says, </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>\"The person who thinks he has found the ultimate truth is wrong. \n          There is an often-quoted verse in Sanskrit, which appears in the Chinese \n          <i>Tao-te Ching</i> [Taoist Scripture] as well: 'He who thinks he knows, \n          doesn't know. He who knows that he doesn't know, knows. For in this \n          context, to know is not to know. And not to know is to know.'\" \n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>What's wrong with this statement? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- This statement is a self contradiction. How does he know that \"he \n          who knows doesn't know?\" He's claiming a kind of knowledge that \n          he says we can't have. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Campbell insists that the biblical authors were aware of the mythological \n          nature of their writings. They wrote, Campbell insists, \"as if\" \n          their stories were literally true. What passages of scripture directly \n          reject his view? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Several passages are relevant. Perhaps none more than this: </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- \"We did not follow cleverly invented stories [GK <i>muthos </i>= \n          myths] when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus \n          Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.\" (2 Peter 1:16) \n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- see also I Corinthians 15:1-19. Go through the passage and identify \n          the statements that lay stress on the importance of the actual historicity \n          of Christ's death. Does this passage allow in any way for a metaphorical \n          or mythical understanding of the resurrection? </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      \n      <h3>Feminist Spirituality</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>The authors make a distinction between the legitimate concerns of \n          women in a rapidly changing culture and the ideological position taken \n          by feminists. Can you see how the legitimate concerns of women (or any \n          other definable social group) is different from a militant ideological \n          point of view? How is feminism different from the concerns of women? \n        </li>\n        <li>Clearly, feminism is a type of affirmative postmodernism. The ideological \n          approach to truth is clear in all of feminist literature, especially \n          among feminist theologians. They start from the perspective of what \n          they conceive to be \"women's experience.\" Read the following \n          quotes from the chapter: </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>\"By women's experience as a key to hermeneutics or theory of interpretation, \n          we mean precisely that experience which arises when women become critically \n          aware of these falsifying and alienating experiences imposed upon them \n          as women by a male-dominated culture.\" </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>\"All women live with male violence . . .\" </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Do you think that this is an appropriate place to begin forming an \n          approach to reading the Bible? Why, or Why not? </li>\n        <li>Read the following quote carefully. What implications do you find \n          in the statement? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>\"Whatever contradicts those convictions [arising from women's \n          experience] cannot be accepted as having the authority of an authentic \n          revelation of truth. It is simply a matter of there being no turning \n          back. We can be dispossessed of our best insights, proven wrong in our \n          judgments. But as long as those insights continue to make sense to us, \n          and as long as our basic judgments seem to us incontrovertible, there \n          can be no turning back. So it is with feminist consciousness and the \n          interpretation of scripture.\" </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>What do you think of the feminist discussion of Genesis 2:22-24 (the \n          creation of Eve out of Adam)? Does it justify male violence against \n          women, as feminist theologians argue? </li>\n      </ul>\n      \n      <h2>John Bradshaw</h2>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Bradshaw is the high priest of the inner child movement in popular \n          psychology. Do any members of the group feel they have benefited from \n          this school? </li>\n        <li>What do you think of Bradshaw's loathing for so-called \"patriarchy?\" \n          Do you see evidence that people lose their ability to direct themselves \n          because they were raised under patriarchy? </li>\n        <li>If my inner child is the true me, and I am \"championing my inner \n          child,\" is this the same, or different than championing me? </li>\n        <li>What do you think of entering the mindless state Bradshaw calls \"the \n          silence?\" Have you ever done this in connection with religion, \n          or have you seen others do so? </li>\n        <li>The Bible teaches that meditation is good in passages like Psalms \n          1. What difference, if any, do you see between biblical meditation and \n          the sort of meditation Bradshaw advances? </li>\n      </ul>\n      \n      <h2>Frederick Turner</h2>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Read the section on Turner first. </li>\n        <li>The authors claim, \"Like some even in the evangelical camp today, \n          Turner discounts the importance of truth and theology in favor of ritualistic \n          experience.\" Have you seen this? Do you think the contemporary \n          churches are more, or less ritualistic than the New Testament church? \n        </li>\n        <li>What do you think of Turner's suggestion that ritual does not need \n          to be linked to any particular truth? Are you aware of any similarity \n          in the ritual of different religions? </li>\n        <li>Could you see people from different religions coming together based \n          on ritual? </li>\n      </ul>\n      \n      <h2>Facilitator's Guide, 5 Case Studies</h2>\n      <h3>Elaine Pagels</h3>\n      <p>Pagels provides an excellent example of how postmodernists approach the \n        Bible.

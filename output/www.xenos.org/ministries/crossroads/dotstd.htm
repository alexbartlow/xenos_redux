The interviewer asked, \"Is there \n          such a thing as absolute truth?\" Students answered: </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>\"Truth is whatever you believe.\" </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>\"No, there is no absolute truth, and if there was, how would we \n          know what it is?\" </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>\"People who believe in absolute truth are dangerous.\" </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Have you encountered comments like this from your non-Christian friends? \n        </li>\n        <li>What barriers might such views create to evangelism? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>To understand <i>why</i> people think this way, we need to understand \n          the postmodern shift in thought. A key underlying assumption of postmodernism \n          is how they conceive <b>human nature</b>. While modernists viewed people \n          as autonomous (and capable of independent rational thought), postmodernists \n          see human identity and thinking as the product of culture. Leffel states, \n          \"postmodernists deny we have a \"self\" that exists independent \n          of our social reality. Culture and society <i>create</i> individuals \n          as well as all their thoughts and attitudes.\" The following quote \n          is by Peter Berger, whose analysis is often cited by postmodernists: \n          <br>\n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>\"A thought of any kind is grounded in society . . .

In other words, his emotions \n          and his self-interpretation like his actions are predefined for him \n          by society, and so is his cognitive approach to the universe that surrounds \n          him.\" </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>If \"a thought of any kind is grounded in society,\" certain \n          important implications follow.

Postmodernists point out that individuals \n          always interact with reality through the medium of language. All mental \n          activities, they say, are based in language. We think in words. We communicate \n          with words. People are connected to reality through the labels they \n          assign to their perceptions and ideas. These labels, or words, are arbitrary, \n          and evolve in society. The more abstract (and often more important) \n          our ideas are, the more dependent we are on words alone to provide meaning. \n          But if language is the way people relate to reality, then we must understand \n          the nature of language. </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>Let's think about the components of <b>language</b> that postmodernists \n          say makes objectivity impossible: </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li><i>Semantics</i>--the meaning of words and phrases. Postmodernists \n          say that, since societies define words, and our thinking is rooted in \n          language, we can't go beyond a culturally relative way of knowing. Knowledge \n          claims themselves are just a matter of cultural conditioning. Can you \n          think of any evidence that knowledge is not necessarily limited to a \n          given culture? </li>\n        <li><i>Syntax</i>--the structure or logic of language. Postmodernists \n          say that every language has a structure, or logic. Words are related \n          to each other by connective words such as \"if/ then,\" \"and,\" \n          \"either/or\" and so on. Postmodernists say that the linguistic \n          constructions for the West promote a hierarchical, \"either/or\" \n          way of thinking. The language of science, logic, and progress shape \n          the way we think. That's why we don't think <i>holistically</i> and \n          <i>inclusively</i>.

Postmodernists hold \n          that all knowledge claims are arbitrary, and that none are ultimately \n          more objective than another because we lack <i>certainty</i>. On a practical \n          level, what's wrong with this critique? </li>\n        <li>Imagine this discussion:<br>\n          \"There is no such thing as truth\"<br>\n          \"Really, is that true?\" <br>\n          \"Yes it is\"<br>\n          \"Well if that's true than there's at least one true thing--your \n          statement!

But \n          as Leffel points out, this is inconsistent with some things we know \n          about psychological development and the development of language. Leffel \n          cites authorities who show that the mind is active and makes clear rational \n          distinctions <i>prior to the acquisition of language</i>. How do these \n          findings impact that postmodern view of linguistic cultural determinism? \n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      \n      <h3>Facilitator's Guide to Our New Challenge: Postmodernism</h3>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>Be sure group members have read the chapter.

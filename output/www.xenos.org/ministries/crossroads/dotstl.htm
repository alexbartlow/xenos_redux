Since more \n          African Americans are poor, it is not surprising that they more often \n          are arrested in conjunction with other crimes, and are found to be in \n          possession of crack. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Wealthier white cocaine users are better able to hide their activities \n          from police than the poor. Crack abuse remains a street crime, more \n          liable to discovery. Note: Even if these last two explanations are correct, \n          racism may be a factor in why proportionately more blacks are poor. \n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Critical legal theorists claim that judges wear robes and use archaic \n          language in order to gain wrongful legitimation.

If lack of experience means I am away from \n          the Lord, then experience has become my definition of what true spirituality \n          is all about. This is especially true when experience has been lacking \n          for a relatively short time. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Put differently, when experience is the goal of my walk with God, \n          I am no longer in line with biblical priorities. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>McCallum says, \"When we deny reason, we automatically deny truth.\" \n          Is this necessarily so? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- It is, if by \"truth\" we mean objective truth--truth that \n          does not depend on my believing it to be true. Note that the notion \n          of objective truth is linked to the \"correspondence theory of truth.\" \n          That is, my thought is true when it corresponds to external reality. \n          Note also that this is the Bible's own definition of truth. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Have you ever heard an evangelical Christian question whether reason \n          applies to the things of God? </li>\n        <li>What do you think of one who holds that reason applies part of the \n          time, but not all the time? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Anyone who claims that reason does not apply to some part of his \n          own position is guilty of the logical fallacy called \"special pleading.\" \n          He is pleading for a rule to apply to his argument that he will not \n          allow for other arguments. In other words, if we think reason doesn't \n          apply to some areas, we are forced to admit it may not apply to any \n          area. If so, we can no longer use reason to refute any argument. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Have you ever felt personally embarrassed by the absolute truth claims \n          of Christianity? If so, what should you do? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Discuss ways to soften the blow without compromising the truth. This \n          is called \"tact\" in communication, and many Christians could \n          use more of it. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Do you think the church today is too \"left-brained?\" Or \n          do you agree with McCallum that most Christian people are insufficiently \n          sophisticated in their theological thinking? </li>\n        <li>McCallum thinks, \"Reason is <i>reliable</i>, but not <i>sufficient</i>. \n          As biblical Christians, we believe reason can tell us much about the \n          world, but not everything. We also need revelation.\" Can we hold \n          to knowledge that goes beyond reason without denying the validity of \n          reason? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Yes, we can. Do you know how the copier in your office works? Perhaps \n          not. Do you know what the future holds? Definitely not. Yet neither \n          of these are incompatible with reason, or irrational. So, too, God may \n          be beyond our comprehension, but this does not mean he is irrational. \n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <h5>Postmodern vs. Christian Views on Culture </h5>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Missions experts are concerned today about \"contextualization\"--adapting \n          Christianity to other cultures, and avoiding exporting western cultural \n          features to other non-western cultures. How would you differentiate \n          between postmodern views on culturally constructed reality and appropriate \n          biblical contextualization? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Contextualization means we dress and speak in ways compatible with \n          another culture <i>in order</i> to bring them the universal truth of \n          the Gospel. Postmodernists deny there are universal truths. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>McCallum says, \"Christians have no debate with the observation \n          that people usually adopt their culture's point of view. Our problem \n          is with the postmodern position that they <i>have no choice in this</i>, \n          because they are imprisoned in the reality constructed by their language \n          and culture. We must reject cultural determinism.\" Do you agree \n          with this? Why, or why not? What difference would it make if we adopted \n          one or the other view on this question? Can you think of any biblical \n          material on Christ and other cultures? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- The idea that people are conditioned by their culture flies directly \n          in the face of the notion of universal judgment. It also renders Christian \n          missions pointless. Consider how Paul, Abraham, Jesus and others defied \n          their cultures to set forward new understandings based on revelation. \n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\"The truth stands <i>over</i> culture, as its judge, not <i>under</i> \n          culture as its product.\" Give some examples of how this statement \n          might work in real life. </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- This is a very important truth. How would we know that slavery was \n          wrong? Not by our slave owning culture, but by the principles in God's \n          word (I Corinthians 7:23 etc.) </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <h5>Postmodern vs. Christian Views on Language </h5>\n      <ul>\n        <li>In any literary text, interpretation is unavoidable. How, then, can \n          Christians claim texts have objective, fixed messages we must discover? \n        </li>\n        <li>Under reader-centered postmodern hermeneutics, readers are free to \n          generate new meaning in biblical texts. Therefore, McCallum claims, \n          \"they are in the position formerly occupied by God--that of revealer \n          and source of truth.\" Is this statement too hard? </li>\n        <li>Discuss the difference between <i>interpretation </i>and <i>application \n          </i>of Scripture. How does this distinction relate to the idea of reader-response \n          hermeneutics? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <blockquote> \n        <p>- Interpretation is a matter of what the author intended to communicate. \n          Application is a matter of how God wants to apply the word to my life. \n          The former is objective. The latter is subjective. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>McCallum says, \"Postmodernists aren't wrong in everything they \n          say, but their fundamental thrust is completely wrong and incompatible \n          with biblical Christianity.\" Is this statement too strong?

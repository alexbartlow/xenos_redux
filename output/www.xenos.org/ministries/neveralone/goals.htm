We welcome people who struggle with chemical dependency, as \n        well  as their family and friends.</p>\n      <p>While some of our members belong to other churches, Never Alone ministries \n        are part of Xenos and the local church community. Most participants are \n        involved in Xenos home groups. In the sense of 1 Corinthians 12, we are \n        grateful to be part of the greater Christian community.</p>\n      <h3>What you&#x92;ll \n        experience at a meeting:</h3>\n      <h3>Never Alone (substance abuse recovery) </h3>\n      <p>The Friday evening group examines recovery-related topics such as anger, jealousy, injustice, grieving, relapse, new friendships, social contact with alcoholics and addicts, substitutional addictive behaviors, anonymity vs. confidentiality, the myth of control and independence, making amends, fears,  and surrenduring our lives over to God.</p>\n      <p>For more information about the Never Alone meetings, please call 614.823.6510, extension 723.</p>\n      <h3>&#xA0;</h3>\n       \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n </td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"130\"> <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/neveralone/index.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/neveralone/graphics/na_nav.gif\" width=\"130\" alt=\"never alone home\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/neveralone/goals.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/neveralone/graphics/goals.gif\" width=\"130\" alt=\"link to goals\" border=\"0\" name=\"goals\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/neveralone/questions.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/neveralone/graphics/questions.gif\" width=\"130\" alt=\"link to questions\" border=\"0\" name=\"questions\"></a><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/neveralone/activities.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/neveralone/graphics/activities.gif\" width=\"130\" alt=\"link to activities\" border=\"0\" name=\"activities\"></a><br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/neveralone/meetings.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/neveralone/graphics/meetings.gif\" width=\"130\" alt=\"link to meetings\" border=\"0\" name=\"meetings\"></a><br> \n</p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/counseling/index.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/neveralone/graphics/counseling.gif\" width=\"130\" alt=\"link to pastoral counseling\" border=\"0\" name=\"counseling\"></a> \n      </p>\n    </td><td width=\"100%\"></td></div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"NeverAlone: Our Goals","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/ministries/neveralone/goals.htm"}

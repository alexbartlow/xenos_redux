Those leaders have raised up hundreds more. Speaking from their 50 years of combined experience in Xenos, the authors explain in practical and biblical terms how anyone can raise up disciples. This book is intensely practical, but with solid biblical foundations throughout.<br>\n\n\n\n       \n\n\n\n       \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n</td>\n    </tr> \n<tr> \n      <td valign=\"top\">\n<a name=\"6\"></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n              \n\n\n  \n            <img src=\"http://store.xenos.org/media/SpiritRel.jpg\" alt=\"SpiritRel.jpg\" width=\"97\" vspace=\"3\" hspace=\"3\" border=\"0\">\n      \n\n\n\n\n        <b>              Spiritual Relationships That Last - What the Bible Says About Dating and Marriage            </b>  \n       \n  \n\n\n\n    <br>\n\n  \n          <b>$8.95</b>            \n\n\n        \n  <br><p>by <b>Dennis McCallum</b> and <b>Gary DeLashmutt</b></p>\n\n<p>\"\"This is a refreshingly biblical, cutting-edge vision of marriage as it could be if we were to drop the cultural myths that weigh us down.

Over 550 lay leaders (362 in the adult groups, \n                 100 in the high school groups, and 89 in the junior high groups) volunteer \n                 their time to lead these 127 home groups.</p>\n               <p>Each Pastoral Home Group is assigned a Home Group Consultant staff \n                 member for oversight. Oversight is intended to ensure that Xenos home \n                 groups are duplicating themselves as they grow. Consultants strive to \n                 encourage, to equip, to counsel, and to help leaders promote group growth \n                 and health. Additionally, oversight staff provides the elders and management \n                 of Xenos with crucial information regarding the health, needs and priority \n                 of this key home group work. </p>\n               <p>Observation, discussion, assessment, feedback, reporting and prayer are \n                 key components to the oversight process.

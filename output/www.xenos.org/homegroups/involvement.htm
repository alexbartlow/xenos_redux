However, it can be quite another matter to encourage others to get involved. </p>\n               <p>Most of the adults attending Xenos are also involved a home group. \n                 How do we help people toward this level of involvement? How do we communicate \n                 the importance of home groups to all who attend our <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/ministries/ct/ct.htm\">Central \n                   Teachings</a>? </p>\n               <h3>Here are some of the ways people are made aware of the benefits of \n                 being in <img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/homegroups/graphics/hg_meeting1-pola.jpg\" width=\"188\">a home group at Xenos:</h3>\n                 <h4>Taken by their host</h4>\n                 <p>Most new people at a Xenos meeting were brought by a member who shared \n                   about Christ with them. These hosts will also invite them to be their \n                   guest at their own home churches. Home churches typically grow relationally, \n                   not geographically.</p>\n                 <h4>Modeling from the leadership</h4>\n                 <p>Every Central Teaching teacher, every Xenos staff member, and every \n                   type of ministry team leader is involved in a home group.</p>\n                 <h4>Teachings</h4>\n                 <p>Central Teaching teachers and <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/index.htm\">class</a> teachers regularly highlight the importance of home group involvement \n                   for spiritual growth. They communicate this through direct instruction \n                   and through offering personal examples. This channel has been extremely \n                   helpful in raising people&#x2019;s interest in home groups.</p>\n                 <h4>Spontaneous sharing in the larger meetings </h4>\n                 <p>After the teaching portion of every Central Teaching we have a time \n                   for questions and comments from the group. Members will often spontaneously \n                   share about a spiritual victory, an answered prayer, or an experience \n                   of love that occurred as a direct result of his involvement with others \n                   in a home group. The intimacy available through home groups becomes \n                   clearer.</p>\n                 <h4><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/homegroups/connection.htm\">Home Group Connection </a> /Welcome Booth</h4>\n                 <p>The Home Group Connection web page allows you to see where  home groups are located around Columbus. Information includes meeting nights, demographics and an e-mail address for contacting a leader of each group. The highly-visible Welcome Booth  is located in the lobby \n                   of the meeting building. Here, curious individuals can interact with the home group section of the Xenos \n                   web site, and talk with Home Group Connection staff members.</p>\n               <h3>Values: </h3>\n               <ul>\n                 <li><h4><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/um2-7.htm\">Koinonia</a></h4>\n                 <p>As mentioned elsewhere, true biblical <i>koinonia</i> develops best \n                   in smaller groups. </p></li>\n                 <ul>\n                   <li>\n                     <p>For one thing, smaller home groups provide a natural venue for \n                       building close, consistent relationships for giving and receiving \n                       biblical love. The home group context allows a profound level of \n                       intimacy to develop among the members, so that each person can truly \n                       play a vital role in the spiritual growth of others in the group. \n                       Home groups become even closer when they operate <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/cellmod.htm\">cell \n                         groups</a>.</p>\n                   </li>\n                   <li>\n                     <p>Also, home groups provide a natural context for discovering and \n                       exercising <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/principles/spgifts.htm\">spiritual \n                         gifts</a>. People are more aware of each other&#x2019;s needs in smaller \n                       groups, and opportunities to serve and step into new roles are most \n                       clearly seen in the context of a home group. Thus, home groups offer \n                       individuals an excellent opportunity to discover and then pursue \n                       God&#x2019;s specific purpose for them.</p>\n                   </li>\n                 </ul>\n                 <li><h4>Opportunity to practice what we learn </h4>\n                 <p>\"Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up\" (1 Corinthians 8:1). \n                   God intends for biblical knowledge to be put into practice in the context \n                   of loving relationships. Home groups provide an ideal environment in \n                   which individuals can contribute to the meeting by sharing what they've \n                   learned (1 Corinthians 14:26), and they can use their growing biblical \n                   knowledge to apply truth with love to each others&#x2019; life situations.</p></li>\n                 <li><h4><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/um2-9.htm\">Discipleship</a></h4>\n                 <p>One-on-one discipleship (or mentoring) relationships are common in \n                   Xenos, but normally only with people already involved in a home group \n                   and a cell group. Disciples can be mentored most effectively in the \n                   context of home groups and cell groups as they learn to love, serve, \n                   shepherd, teach, etc. </p></li>\n                 <li><h4><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/index.htm\">Xenos Classes</a></h4>\n                 <p>Some Xenos classes are available only to home group members.

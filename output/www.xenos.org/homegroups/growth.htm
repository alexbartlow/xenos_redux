Nothing \n                 is more selfish than a group that ignores those who need Christ \n                 and turn inward. Each member of a home group should grow in Christ \n                 and eventually realize they have something to contribute to the \n                 life of the group and not simply receive. Therefore we advocate \n                 spiritual growth and ministry within all home groups.</p>\n               <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/um2-3.htm\">Evangelism \n                 in the Local Church</a> (from the <i><strong>Understanding Ministry</strong></i> study<img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/homegroups/graphics/guy-blue-tilt.jpg\" width=\"212\" alt=\"man\"> guide) discusses factors involved in facilitating and                 encouraging evangelism.</p>\n               <p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/um2-5.htm\">The Evangelistic Prayer Ministry of the Church</a> (from the <i><strong>Understanding \n                   Ministry</strong></i> study guide) covers how groups can enhance \n                 their outreach by putting first things first.</p>\n               <p>Christian <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/teachings/nt/romans/dennis/rom12-3.htm\">sanctification \n                 and ministry</a> are inextricably entwined.

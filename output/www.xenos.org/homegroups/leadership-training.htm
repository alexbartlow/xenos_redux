Foremost is an ability to handle \n                accurately the Word of Truth. Leaders with shallow knowledge of \n                God's word struggle and often fail. At best, such leaders would \n                have little to offer their groups.</p>\n              <p>People learn how to lead home groups from two sources. First is the training \n                available in home groups. Each group is active in leadership development \n                through cell groups and individual mentoring. Read about <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/homiletics/firsttch.htm\">how \n                  to prepare your first few teachings</a>.</p>\n              <p>The other<img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/homegroups/graphics/Womentalking.jpg\" width=\"220\" alt=\"women talking\"> source \n                is the <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/admin/equip.htm\">Equipping Division</a>, which \n                provides a variety of courses. Besides Bible study, leaders receive \n                training in issues of pastoral counseling, discussion leading, and \n                how to teach. Challenge Groups provide a monthly meeting for Bible \n                Study and fellowship for leaders who have completed the core equipping \n                course work. We strive to have every leader understand <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers/godmin.htm\">God's \n                  part in ministry</a>.</p>\n              <p>Leaders must also learn to deal with a variety of personal issues. Course work \n                is helpful, but \"on-the-job\" training is indispensable. \n                That's why a mainstay in our leadership training is personal discipleship. \n                Our leaders are committed to discipleship and are regularly helping \n                interested individuals grow toward leadership.</p>\n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n\t\t\t  \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n            </div>\n            \n          </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/homegroups/graphics/Womentalking.jpg","title":"Home Groups","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/homegroups/leadership-training.htm"}

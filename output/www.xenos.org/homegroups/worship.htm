(Acts. 2, 20) When examining these meetings, \n                Xenos elders have concluded that the large meetings were not apparently \n                worship services. Whether the meeting held at Solomon's portico, which \n                was said to be characterized by \"the apostles' teaching\" or \n                the one in the schoolroom of Tyrannus, which was also characterized as \n                a teaching meeting, we doubt very much that either of these large public \n                gatherings bore any similarity to today's church worship service. In fact, \n                no precedent in the New Testament seems to fit what we accept as corporate \n                worship today, according to most churches. We believe much of what American \n                Christians think of as worship comes <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/um1-1.htm\">more \n                  from the Old Testament than from the New</a>. </p>\n              <p><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/homegroups/graphics/workday-pola.jpg\" width=\"198\" alt=\"workday\">We find that the concept of worship, which was liturgical and formal \n                in the Old Testament, is reinterpreted completely in the New. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/um2-2.htm\">New \n                  Testament worship</a> becomes serving God, whether by giving our whole \n                lives to him, giving our resources to him, bringing others to him through \n                evangelism, or serving others with acts of love in his name. It can also \n                be praising him through prayer or song.</p>\n              <p>We do find corporate worship implied in the injunction found in 1 Cor. \n                14:26 \"What is the outcome then, brethren? When you assemble, each \n                one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an \n                interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.\" But this \n                passage in context is speaking about a participative meeting held in the \n                home&#x97;a home church meeting. The home church was also the venue for \n                the first century \"love feast\" according to early church sources, \n                which included communion and worship.</p>\n              <p>In a desire to imitate the early church therefore, Xenos has designated \n                the home church as the main venue for corporate worship. Visitors are \n                shocked at times to find that our central meetings are not worship services \n                at all, but public preaching points where Christians are taught the word \n                of God and non-Christians are presented with the gospel.<img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/homegroups/graphics/hg_meeting1-pola.jpg\" width=\"200\" alt=\"ct-teaching\"></p>\n              <p>Home churches in Xenos decide how to worship corporately. Some have a \n                time of song and praise. Others worship in prayer. Some groups worship \n                at their regular meetings, while others hold special meetings dedicated \n                to prayer and worship. Communion is never shared at our large meetings. \n                Home churches or cell groups are, we feel, much more appropriate for this \n                intimate act of worship. By avoiding worship at the large meetings, we \n                think we avoid making non Christians feel obligated to sing songs of praise \n                to a God in whom they don't believe. At the same time, Christians from \n                other churches are reluctant to transfer to Xenos because they expect \n                and demand a worship service.</p>\n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n            </div>\n            \n          </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/homegroups/graphics/workday-pola.jpg","title":"Worship and Home Groups in Xenos","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/homegroups/worship.htm"}

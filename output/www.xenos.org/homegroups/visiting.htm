A friend of yours invited you to come to a Bible \n                study at someone&#x2019;s house. Since you visited a Central Teaching last week, \n                you ask your friend, how this \"home group\" meeting would be \n                different. <img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/homegroups/graphics/altim-pola.jpg\" width=\"198\" alt=\"altim\">He tells you that it will be smaller, more personal and informal, \n                and that the teaching would be shorter and more interactive. He also informs \n                you that home groups generally do not have a time of singing and do not \n                provide childcare.</p>\n              <p>As you walk into the house together, the first thing you notice is the \n                casual atmosphere: upbeat music is playing, people are chatting in the \n                kitchen as they share some snacks, and the people seem relaxed and familiar \n                with each other. The second thing you notice is that a few of the people \n                stop their conversations and welcome you as your friend introduces you, \n                putting you more at ease.</p>\n              <p>After about 20 minutes of casually interacting with people as others \n                arrive, it&#x2019;s time for the actual meeting to begin. People take their seats, \n                and many people get out their Bibles. You feel a little uncomfortable \n                that you don&#x2019;t have a Bible, but then your friend shares his with you \n                and shows you where to look. The teacher welcomes the group and begins \n                the meeting with prayer. She explains that she&#x2019;s a bit nervous tonight \n                because she doesn't teach very often. For the next 30-40 minutes, the \n                teacher leads the group through the passage (providing some background \n                information, explaining the meaning of the text, and applying the content \n                to the everyday lives of people in the group). At various points, the \n                teacher stops and poses questions to the group for discussion. Many of \n                these questions are fairly personal, having to do with how people view \n                God, react to other people, or feel about themselves. You are struck by \n                people&#x2019;s openness as they share their spiritual victories, fears, and \n                questions. You are also struck by people&#x2019;s enthusiasm for God and for \n                what they have read in the Bible. Members chime in to offer support or \n                ideas to each other, while the teacher occasionally interjects thoughts, \n                asks follow-up questions, or redirects the conversation. After a while, \n                the teacher decides to wrap things up. She summarizes the main point of \n                the passage, and the main points of application for the listeners. As \n                she closes the meeting, you reflect on how much biblical knowledge she \n                has for a new teacher. There is a time of group prayer, lasting 10-15 \n                minutes.<img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/homegroups/graphics/hg-chat-pola.jpg\" width=\"211\" alt=\"hg-chat\"></p>\n              <p>After the meeting closes, people move about and begin talking. The music \n                is turned back on, snacks are set out, and someone offers you a cold beverage. \n                The atmosphere is upbeat and party-like. Some people are still sitting \n                on the couch apparently talking more about the teaching. Others are standing \n                in larger groups, laughing and telling stories. You gravitate toward a \n                table where various papers are set out. Next to a home group phone list \n                sits a Xenos Course Offerings flyer. As you scan the list of current offerings, \n                your friend hands you a copy of the home group calendar. It looks the \n                group has a great deal of fun together: upcoming events include a cookout, \n                volleyball, a hay ride, and a beer-tasting party. Someone invites you and \n                your friend to come out to the back porch, where half a dozen people are \n                sitting around a fire pit. Some of the people ask you some questions about \n                yourself&#x2014;your job, your family, etc. You also find out a few things about \n                some of the people there. After a while, you may feel comfortable enough \n                to ask some deeper questions: What is God is like? Why does he allow so \n                much suffering to occur in the world if he is so good? Why should anyone \n                believe what the Bible says? Sometimes the people give you very clear \n                answers, and even show you some things in the Bible to answer your questions. \n                Sometimes the people just seem to listen or agree that those are tough \n                questions. The question that is most on your heart is the hardest to ask, \n                and so you wait until there are only a couple people left around the fire. \n                \"What if someone&#x2019;s done some really, really bad stuff? What do they \n                have to do for God to forgive them? Is it even possible?\" After you \n                ask these last questions, you hear from the other people about the significance \n                of Jesus&#x2019; death on the cross, and how it makes it possible for God to \n                forgive forever anyone who will ask him. One of the other people there \n                shares his story of how he used to be really, really messed up, but then \n                he took God up on his offer for forgiveness and felt freed from guilt \n                and condemnation for the first time in his life.</p>\n              <p>After talking for a while longer, your friend asks if you are ready to \n                go. You are surprised that so much time has gone by. After a little more \n                small-talk, the two of you stand up to go. One of the guys invites you \n                to come back next week. You say you&#x2019;ll think about it, and you leave.</p>\n              \n            \n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n              \n            </div>\n            \n          </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":"http://www.xenos.org/homegroups/graphics/hg-chat-pola.jpg","title":"Visiting a Typical Xenos Home Group","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/homegroups/visiting.htm"}

Many home\n                 group leaders find themselves periodically overwhelmed with all the diverse\n                 needs of a home group. As leaders, what elements of home group work should\n                 we focus on? What problems are important and need to be addressed, and\n                 which should we ignore? This paper has been helpful in getting leaders\n                   to focus and plan in five critical areas. Doing this sort of planning\n                 will help make the job feel more manageable and help leaders direct their\n                 efforts. Leaders who have used this tool report that even though the\n                 job is big they feel confident they are putting their efforts in the\n            right place.</p>\n               <h3>Using this tool</h3>\n               <ul>\n                 <li> Except for items I and II (see gray box above),\n                 it doesn't matter which order various areas are addressed.</li>\n                 <li> Plans presented here are samples; home group leaders should\n                   customize their own plans according to their specific needs, situations\n                 and opportunities.</li>\n                 <li> This tool is designed to help home group leaders to understand their\n                   job descriptions, and to help direct their focus and thinking about\n                   their group. (A home group leader is responsible either to plan or\n                   to delegate planning to others.)</li>\n                 <li> This approach is just one way to understand home group ministry.\n                   Of course there are important aspects missing; it's not meant to be\n                   an exhaustive list of everything needed for leading a healthy\n                   home group. (E.g., there's nothing here about unity, which is really needed.\n                   Listen to the February 2002 Servant Team meeting tape to hear more\n                 about unity.)</li>\n                 <li> These items are universals and should\n                   be included in the plan for every area. E.g., this whole paper\n                 should be read under the umbrella of the doctrine of grace.</li>\n               </ul>\n               <p>As suggested by the article's title, the goal of a home group leader\n                 should be to plant a healthy home group. Home groups must plant so that\n                 more and more people can enjoy community without the group getting so\n                 big there's no longer a sense of community to enjoy.</p>\n               <p>For a greater understanding of the importance of church-planting read\n                the essays about the <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/essays/index.htm\">underground indigenous\n                  church-planting movement</a>, and listen to the <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/teachings/topical/misc/index.htm\"> Servant Team Retreat audio</a>.</p>\n               <p>Therefore, the goal to plant the home group is the overarching emphasis\n                 for everything that follows, and should be the factor that drives all\n                 planning in the areas listed. Leaders should always have this goal in\n                 mind, even if the actual planting date seems to be years away. Planting\n                 is so healthy and imperative to the work of the church that we should\n                 always be planning for it long before the room is full, and in some cases\n       we should even plant before the room is full.</p>\n               <p>Once leaders develop a <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/planting.html\">plant plan</a> for the\n                 group, the group members will take planting all the more seriously. Sure,\n                 any plan must be flexible and subject to change, but leaders should make\n                 every effort to pick their best plan possible and then work toward it.</p>\n               <p>What does it mean to get serious about planting rather than just going\n                 through the motions? To illustrate this difference, compare a 30-year-old\n                 guy who's been dating the same girl for years, and for years has been\n                 saying, \"Yeah, sure, I want to marry you&#x2014;someday,\" with the\n                 guy who actually takes the necessary actions toward getting married:\n            proposes, sets a date, and marries her.</p>\n               <p>Do the group members view the leadership as serious about planting or\n                 not? </p>\n             <h3><a name=\"faithfulgod\" id=\"faithfulgod\"></a>I. A FAITHFUL GOD</h3>\n               <p><i>Great news, leaders, no plan is needed here! We already have a faithful\n                 God!</i></p>\n               <p>God will grow His church:</p>\n               <ul>\n                 <li> In Matthew 16:10, Jesus states, \"&#x2026;I will build my church, and\n                   the gates of hell will not prevail against it.\" God will build\n                 His church.</li>\n                 <li> Paul says, in 1 Corinthians 3:6-7, \"I planted, Apollos watered,\n                   but God was causing the growth. So then neither the one who plants\n                   nor the one who waters is anything, but God who causes the growth.\" God makes\n                 people and churches grow.</li>\n                 <li> The parable of the mustard seed, in Matthew 13:31-32, teaches that\n                   the church starts small and then grows into something huge. There\n                     is no doubt God will cause his church to grow; He's already told\n                 us he's serious about it.</li>\n               </ul>\n               <h4>What is the application for us?</h4>\n               <p>Ephesians 2:10 states, \"For we are God's workmanship, created in\n                 Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to\n            do.\" </p>\n               <p>God establishes our role in ministry. He has works prepared in\n                 advance for us already. He's not up in heaven wringing his hands, all\n                 worried, wondering if we'll ever have ministry success, wondering if\n                 anything will ever go right in our service. He's not up there\n                 wondering when our day is going to come; He's not worried whether our\n            group is growing as fast as the next one. He knows all about it.</p>\n               <p>Therefore, we don't need to worry about our ministry success\n                 either. We don't need to dump any wasted energy into comparing ourselves\n                 with others; we can look forward, obeying God and trusting Him that He's\n          got some good work prepared for us to do.</p>\n               <p>Understanding God's faithfulness to build His church and to establish\n                 our ministry will cause us to experience more peace and to be more relaxed\n                 as we minister, to lead more confidently, and to be more gracious with\n                 ourselves and others during times of failure. We will exhibit a faith\n                 in God that will attract others to the group.</p>\n            <h3><a name=\"growingleaders\" id=\"growingleaders\"></a>II.

Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though\n                 God were entreating through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled\n          to God\" (2 Corinthians 5:8-10).</p>\n               <p>This area is crucial.

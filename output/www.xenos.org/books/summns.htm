NO CHARGE!</i></b></p>\n\n<p><b><i>The Summons </i></b>is a deeply emotional story of spiritual\ndiscovery, survival, triumph and defeat on a modern secular university campus. Danger can\ncome in many forms, some harder to recognize than others. So can love. Sherry's academic\nbrilliance can't save her any more than her good looks. But even when she meets Christ she\nfinds her struggle has only begun. Instead of \"arriving\" at a life of\nself-satisfaction, she finds she has been summoned by God to serve. She and the new\npioneering group of Christians on Campus discover how to reach others for Christ, but the\nEvil One isn't going to let them off that easy. <br>\n</p>\n\n<p><b><i>The Summons </i></b>delivers deep biblical content while telling\na story that will warm your heart. <br>\n</p>\n\n<p><i><b>The Summons</b> </i>will challenge everything you believe about\nthe church and Christian living. <br>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Listen to what people are saying about <i>The Summons</i>: <br>\n</h3>\n\n<p>\"This was one of those books that makes you feel sad when you're\nfinished because it's like the end of a great relationship. But, what I think is making it\nfeel even worse for me is that I'm left with a sense of longing that my life could be\nfilled with the kind of things going on in the story.\" </p>\n\n<p>--<b>Paul Santhouse, Executive </b></p>\n\n<p>\"The Summons takes us back to a time when what mattered most was a\nburning passion to love and serve God.\" </p>\n\n<p>--<b>Dan Allender, Author </b></p>\n\n<p>\"An inspiration--a powerful, and sensational book. . .\" </p>\n\n<p><b>--Heidi Edwards, California </b></p>\n\n<p>\"It was not only fun to read; it actually taught me a lot too. . .\nThis book challenged me to view Christianity in a new way.\" </p>\n\n<p><i>--<b>Campus Life Magazine </b></i></p>\n\n<p>\"I couldn't put it down...I was moved to the point of tears\nseveral times during the book. I also reaffirmed several times the decision which I have\nmade to give my life completely to Christ.\" </p>\n\n<p><b>--Anonymous, Salesman </b></p>\n\n<p>\"A real page-turner.

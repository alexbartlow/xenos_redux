What if one\nhas habits or tastes that annoy the other? What if their priorities are different? Secular\nmarriages have no clear answer to these questions. Generally, counselors suggest couples\nshould compromise or take turns in decision making. But these solutions don't always work.\nSpouses wind up saying, \"We decided your way last time,\" and we open a new\nsource of conflict. Then there's this one: \"I think this would be a good\ncompromise.\" \"No, <b>this</b> would be a compromise!\" Similarly, consider\nhow you would feel in this scenario: \"We decided my way about which movie to see last\nnight, but now we have to decide your way on which house to buy!\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Both trading-off and compromising may be useful in some situations, but are often\nproblematic. Some decisions won't allow for compromise. Suppose a couple does not agree in\nwhich area of town to live. If they compromise, they may end up living in an area they\nboth hate. This is why, in real life we find that the more powerful partner usually\ncompels the weaker to comply with his or her agenda. Powerless partners have to decide how\nmuch they are prepared to take. The choice seems to be either slavery, perpetual power\nstruggles or flight. Other couples don't have a clearly more powerful spouse, and may\nengage in constant wrangling over even the smallest things.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/menwmn1.gif\" width=\"288\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">In this illustration, we see two different people, each with their own frame of\nreference which determines their views, their values, their appetites, etc. Since the\nframe of references, or life experiences are completely different from one another, they\nhave no basis for resolving differences.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">When other people's actions hurt or annoy us, what can we do? When we simply can't get\nsomeone close to us to be reasonable, where do we turn? We either try to make the other\nperson change through force or manipulation, or we learn to keep our distance. No wonder\nmodern people have trouble attaining intimacy in relationships!</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">With Christ, we have an alternative way of life. We are no longer two people trying to\nget our own way. In a Christian relationship, both partners are concerned with discovering\nand following God's way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><img src=\"http://www.xenos.org/graphics/menwmn2.gif\" width=\"285\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Here is a basis for closeness. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">On one hand, we have a reason for calling on the other person to change based on the\nwill of God. On the other hand, we have an obligation to be willing to change ourselves in\naccordance with the will of God. Although we could still disagree about what God wants at\ntimes, <i>at least we have some basis</i> for agreement other than who has the most power.\nFinally, in Christ we also have a basis for grace in relationships, which means we can\nforgive negatives in our spouse-something we may do in secular relationships if we judge\nit to be expedient, but without any other reason.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">The paradigm of Christian couples living under the authority of God includes benefits\nand sacrifices for both partners. Most of the sacrifices are in the area of ego and\nselfishness. The benefits are in the areas of closeness, the gratification of being used\nby God, and the joy of loving deeply.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"style1\">Marriage Roles and Gender</h2>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">In addition to the general idea of basing a marriage on the will of God, Scripture\nteaches that the husband should be the spiritual \"head\" in marriage. What does\nthis mean? Headship is a troubling concept in our day, and we need to understand it in\ncontext.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Being the \"head\" in the biblical sense means the husband is responsible to\ninitiate love and self-sacrifice for the well-being of his wife.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/mythmw.htm#Footnote1\">[footnote 1]</a><a name=\"foot1\"> </a>It does not mean the\nhusband must be spiritually older than his wife, nor does it give the husband a license to\ninsist on his own way. He is only to call for God's way. However, faithful exegesis of the\nrelevant passages will show that God affirms male leadership in the home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Remember<b><i>, leadership in the biblical context is servant leadership</i></b>. Paul\nsaid husbands should \"love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave\nhimself up for her.\" (Ephesians 5:25) This is the kind of leadership Christ\ndemonstrated when he let himself be nailed on a cross for us. Jesus could be very\nauthoritative, but he did not come to selfishly boss people around. He said, \"Even\nthe Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom\nfor many.\" (Mark 10:45) When Jesus gives us a directive, it is not because he enjoys\ncontrolling us, but because he is concerned for our welfare. He also extends an amazing\nlevel of freedom to his followers, allowing us to defy his will and still continue our\nrelationship without rejection. He will discipline us for our good, but he will never\nreject us. (Hebrews 13:5)</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Coming under such self-denying leadership poses no threat to our happiness. A woman who\nsubmits to the servant leadership of a mature Christian man should be letting herself in\nfor a life where her husband devotes himself to providing for her needs, protecting her\nand (yes) directing her at times. A servant leader will not insist on his way in areas\nwhere it is not possible to know objectively what God wants. He will call for his wife to\nfollow Christ along with himself, but will graciously allow her to refuse his suggestions\noften. Like Jesus, he will not compel obedience, but will seek to win it through\npersuasion and love. The Lord doesn't force us to follow him; he wants us to follow\nwillingly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Any man who is eager to assume such a role of leadership has probably not grasped what\nthe Lord is saying in this passage. To be responsible for initiating love--for initiating\nself giving--is a daunting role. Properly understood, no husband would object if his wife\noffered to lead the way in self-sacrifice for awhile. The role of head in a marriage is\nnot a role of privilege but of responsibility and self-sacrifice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Our postmodern aversion to authority is incompatible with Christianity, not only\nbecause it flies in the face of biblical teaching, but because it is based on our fear of\ncorrupt and self-serving authority figures.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"style1\">Servant Leadership In Action</h2>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Christian men should be spiritually mature enough to secure their wives' respect and\nbasic willingness to follow their leadership, contingent, of course, on the higher\nauthority of God.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/mythmw.htm#Footnote2\">[footnote 2]</a><a name=\"foot2\"> </a>When\nthe Bible refers to wives submitting to their husbands, it essentially means wives should\ncultivate an attitude of respect for their husbands.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/mythmw.htm#Footnote3\">[footnote\n3]</a><a name=\"foot3\"> </a>\"Respect\" in this context includes recognition of her\nhusband as a legitimate leader--an inclination to go along with her husband's direction\nwhen possible. A wife who submits to her husband is free to suggest directions or to\nquestion and challenge his direction. She is obligated to point out when she believes he\nis violating God's will. But she would turn away from self-willed resistance or\nmanipulation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Headship does <i>not</i> mean that only wives should be willing to defer to their\nspouses. In fact, willingness to defer to others for Christ's sake is the foundation of <i>all</i>\nrelationships in the Body of Christ. The verb \"submit\" in Ephesians 5:22 is\nreally borrowed from verse 21: \"submitting to <i>one another</i> in the fear of (out\nof respect for) Christ. . . \" Therefore, the wife's submission to the husband within\nChristian marriage is grounded in <i>both</i> spouses' willingness to defer to each other\nin love as well as to other Christian friends in their church.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/mythmw.htm#Footnote4\">[footnote 4]</a><a name=\"foot4\"> </a>We are all to submit to\nChrist's moral leadership whenever it is expressed through others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">All of this means we should emphatically reject the view that submissive wives let\ntheir husbands do all the thinking in the marriage. Neither does it mean that Christian\nhusbands can be bossy and controlling. Biblical headship does not mean that the husband\nmust decide on every matter or even most matters pertaining to the household. Husbands and\nwives should negotiate and agree on who will take responsibility for bill paying, grocery\nshopping, car maintenance and other like matters. Creative and critical discussion between\nspouses about major decisions is <b><i>also</i></b> fully compatible with the idea of\nheadship. Such discussion is necessary for a healthy marriage. If both spouses are\ncommitted to God and to the good of the other, most decisions can and should be mutual,\nand only the weakest husband would fear such discussions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">In the rare cases in which husband and wife cannot agree on an important decision, the\nhusband who has proven himself as a servant leader will usually be able to make a mature\ndecision--either to hold for his view if necessary, or to sacrificially let his wife have\nher way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><b>Like Christ, the Christian husband is to lead the way in demonstrating a humble\ncommitment to God's will rather than insisting on his own will. </b></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Jesus' authority was valid because he did \"not seek his own will, but the will of\nhim who sent\" him. (John 5:30) He also explained that he was willing to \"lay\ndown his life for the sheep.\" (John 10:15) In the same way, the Christian husband is\nto lead the way in demonstrating a humble commitment to God's will rather than insisting\non his own will. He should take the initiative to practice sacrificial service to meet his\nwife's needs, even at his own personal expense. Such husbands are usually able to secure\ntheir wives' trust and respect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Both partners in a marriage should understand and agree on their concept of headship\nbefore getting married. Christians differ on how they interpret these passages, but\nhowever a couple understands them, they need agreement. Those already married may also\nneed to rethink this area. If you are a married woman, are you comfortable responding to\nthe spiritual leadership of your husband? Or is the idea of following your husband\nunrealistic or distasteful? Recognizing leadership in the home may be especially difficult\nfor women who have experienced evil male authority figures, or who have adopted an\nideology that opposes the concept of gender roles.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/mythmw.htm#Footnote5\">[footnote\n5]</a><a name=\"foot5\"> </a>At other times, the husband's way of life makes it difficult\nfor the wife to take his leadership seriously.</p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\">Whatever the causes, resolving these issues are important for Christian marriage.\nAdditional reading on the subject of headship may help.<a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/mythmw.htm#Footnote6\">[footnote\n6]</a><a name=\"foot6\"> </a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a name=\"Footnote1\">1. </a>See Ephesians 5:22-29. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/mythmw.htm#foot1\">Return to\nthe text</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a name=\"Footnote2\">2. </a>Christian wife should never follow morally wrong directives\nfrom her husband. The principle of contingent, or conditional obedience is well understood\nwhen it comes to secular authorities as in Daniel 2:1-18; Acts 4:19,20; 5:29. Strangely\nhowever, some commentators argue that wives should obey their husbands in an uncontingent\nand unqualified way! The text often used to justify this position is 1 Peter 3:5,6 which\nrefers to Sarah's obedience to Abraham with approval. Based on this passage, it is argued\nthat even when Sarah lied to Pharaoh by saying she was Abraham's sister (and nearly had to\ncommit adultery as a result) she was doing the right thing. However, the passage does not\ncondone this incident, but only commends her attitude. In fact, God will hold individuals\nresponsible for wrong they do, even if they were ordered to do it, as the incident in Acts\n4:19,20 demonstrates. Notice also that the incident to which 1 Peter 3 refers involves a\nsin of omission, not one of commission. The statement in vs. 1 that wives should obey\nhusbands even if they are disobedient to the faith means that the <i>husband himself</i>\nis disobedient, not that his directives are morally wrong. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/mythmw.htm#foot2\">Return\nto the text</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a name=\"Footnote3\">3. </a>Note that in summing up the spouses' respective roles in\nEphesians 5:33, Paul uses the word \"respect\" to describe the wife's role. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/mythmw.htm#foot3\">Return to the text</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a name=\"Footnote4\">4. </a>The New American Standard Bible has chosen to indicate not\nonly a new sentence in verse 22, but a new paragraph. This, in spite of the fact that\nverse 22 is a dependent clause sharing the participle \"submitting\" of verse 21. <i>The\nNew American Standard Bible</i>, Referenced Version (Lockman Foundation, 1963) p. 300. See\ncorrectly the paragraph division in <i>New International Version of the New Testament</i>,\n(Grand Rapids: Zondervan Bible Publishers, 1973). However, in our opinion, they still fail\nto bring home sufficiently the force of the shared action. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/mythmw.htm#foot4\">Return\nto the text</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a name=\"Footnote5\">5. </a>Scholars have demonstrated that exploitation of women is a\ndominant theme in church history. However, to respond by holding that submission to anyone\nis a betrayal of one's own personhood, is throwing out the baby with the bath water. Just\nbecause some have abused the concept of male leadership in the home doesn't mean there is\nno such thing as a sacrificial servant leader. <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/books/mythmw.htm#foot5\">Return to the\ntext</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"style1\"><a name=\"Footnote6\">6. </a>For example, Richard N.

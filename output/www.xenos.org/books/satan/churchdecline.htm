The authors  focused on individual counties in the US and Canada, surveying actual  church/synagogue attendance and comparing it with random surveys they were  conducting.

Their estimate for US actual church  attendance is around 20%.</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">Dave Olson, director of church planting for the Evangelical  Covenant Church, surveying only Christian churches (i.e., evangelical,  mainline, and Catholic) has come up with a similar number.

The great  evangelical movements of today are not a vanguard. They are a remnant,  unraveling at every edge. Look at it any way you like: Conversions. Baptisms.  Membership. Retention. Participation. Giving. Attendance. Religious literacy.  Effect on culture. All are down and dropping. It&#x2019;s no secret. Even as  evangelical forces trumpet their purported political and social victories,  insiders are anguishing about their great losses, fearing what the future  holds. Nobody knows what to do about it. A lot of people can&#x2019;t believe it. No  wonder. The idea that evangelicals are taking over America is one of the  greatest publicity scams in history, a perfect coup accomplished by savvy  politicos and religious leaders, who understand media weaknesses and exploit  them brilliantly. Wicker, ix</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">Evangelicals are not the fastest-growing faith group in  America. Neither are Pentecostals. Nonbelievers are the fastest-growing faith  group in America in numbers and percentage. From 1990 to 2001, which was the  last good count, they more than doubled, from 14 million to 29 million. Their  proportion of the population grew from 8 percent to more than 14 percent. That  means there are more than twice as many people who claim no religion as there  are participating evangelicals who subscribe to beliefs that have made the  religious right powerful. Wicker, 53 (citing &#x201C;The American Religious  Identification Survey)</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">According to a Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life study  in 2004 that showed &#x2018;other&#x2019; Christians make up 67% of the U.S. population,  while traditionalist evangelicals (who would be core religious-right  evangelicals) make up only 12 percent of the population. That means there are  five times more non-religious-right Christians than there are religious-right  Christians. Wicker, 54</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">The Southern Baptist Convention&#x2019;s North American Mission  Board report based on the 2001 U.S. Congregational Life Survey found almost the  same number. Transfers, swithchers, or returners account for all but 8 percent  of those who had been in churches fewer than five years. Wicker, 210</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">Wicker points out that Baptists believe people can only be  saved once, but they can be baptized more than once. Anyone who came to Christ  in a church practicing sprinkling would need to be re-baptized. &#x201C;What all this  means when counting baptisms is that any Southern Baptist count of baptisms  would not be a count of only people who had been unsaved and now were saved.  Instead it could include many Christians already saved and baptized in other  churches.&#x201D; Wicker, 61</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">The evidence comes from Southern Baptists&#x2019; own studies. Only  7 percent of members who&#x2019;ve been in a Southern Baptist church five years of  less are true converts.&#x201D; Wicker, 62</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">In the eighteen-to-thirty-four age group, Southern Baptist  baptisms fell 40 percent from one hundred thousand in 1980 to sixty thousand in  2005.&#x201D; Wicker, 63</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">The truth behind all these numbers is that evangelicals are  not converting and cannot convert non-Christian adult Americans, especially  native-born white people, in significant numbers. Wicker, 64</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">A small and declining group of people has been portrayed as  tremendously powerful and growing so rapidly that they might take over the  country&#x2014;when in fact that number of converts among this group is down and  dropping. They are rarely able to convert and adult, middle-class American.  Their share of the population is not 25 percent, but at most 7 percent of the  country and falling. All these numbers come from the churches themselves. Wicker,  67</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">One group, the 7 percent group&#x2026; was the truly committed,  religious-right group. The other larger group comprised evangelicals who were  born again but didn&#x2019;t accept the great majority of the most basic religious  tenets that evangelicals are &#x201C;supposed&#x201D; to live by. Wicker, 86</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">When the Pew Research center for the People and the Press  asked American evangelicals to self-identify without using Barna&#x2019;s nine  questions, it found surprising attitudes&#x2026; 25 percent don&#x2019;t think homosexuality  is wrong, 27 percent don&#x2019;t think having an abortion is wrong, 32 percent don&#x2019;t  think smoking marijuana is wrong, and 40 percent don&#x2019;t think sex between  unmarried people is wrong. Only 20 percent of evangelicals consider themselves  part of the Religious Right. Wicker, 92</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">Evangelical churches aren&#x2019;t baptizing nearly enough people  to keep up with population growth, and baptisms are falling. Among the white  middle class that&#x2019;s been their political, economic, and social base, they  rarely make a true adult convert. The great majority of people being baptized  in evangelical churches are already baptized Christians and children. Wicker, 93</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">They aren&#x2019;t big, they aren&#x2019;t growing, but are they really in  for a fall? Can they make a comeback? No. &#x2026;In each case, we&#x2019;ll see the paradox&#x2026;  the appearance of great strength and success masking weaknesses that are  quietly bleeding the faith and promise to hasten its demise. Wicker, 95</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\"><strong>Mark Kelly, LifeWay  Research: Unchurched Americans Turned Off by Church, Open to Christians, NASHVILLE</strong></p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">A majority of unchurched Americans are turned off by the  institutional church and don&#x2019;t have a biblical understanding about God and  Jesus, yet they believe Jesus makes a positive difference in a person&#x2019;s life  and would enjoy an honest discussion with a friend about spiritual matters.</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">\"A full 72 percent of the people interviewed said they think the church  &#x2018;is full of hypocrites,&#x2019;\" Stetzer said. \"At the same time, however,  71 percent of the respondents said they believe Jesus &#x2018;makes a positive difference  in a person&#x2019;s life&#x2019; and 78 percent said they would &#x2018;be willing to listen&#x2019; to  someone who wanted to share what they believed about Christianity.\"</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">The negative perception for many people, however, seems to be the church,  not Jesus himself, according to the study.</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">While 64 percent of the respondents think \"the Christian religion is a  relevant and viable religion for today,\" 79 percent think Christianity  \"is more about organized religion than about loving God and loving  people.\" Seventy-two percent said they think the church &#x2018;is full of  hypocrites, people who criticize others for doing the same things they do  themselves,\" and 86 percent believe they \"can have a good  relationship with God without being involved in church.\"</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">\"People on the outside see the church as candles, pews and flowers,  rather than people living out their love for God by loving others,\" he  added. \"Such skepticism can only be overcome by churches and believers who  demonstrate the unity and love for which Jesus prayed.\"</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">78 percent of those surveyed said they would be willing to listen to someone  who wanted to talk about their Christian beliefs. The number rose to 89 percent  among adults 18-29 years of age.</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">\"Even though the unchurched have a confused view of God and a negative  view of the church, they are overwhelmingly open to someone sharing about their  Christian faith,\" Stetzer said.\"We think religion is a topic  that is off-limits in polite conversation, but unchurched people say they would  enjoy conversations about spiritual matters.\"</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">&#x201C;That is a rebuke to us as Christians and, at the same time,  a challenge. What is it about the faith we live that causes our culture to like  Jesus but reject the church?\" Stetzer said.</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\"><strong>Thom S. Rainer and  Sam S. Rainer, <em>Essential Church?:  Reclaiming a Generation of Dropouts,</em> B&amp;H Books 2008 </strong></p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">The American church is dying. Conversions are declinng in  almost every denomination. Even in some of the more relatively healthy  denominations, conversions to Christianity  have stagnated. 8</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">Most churches are dwindling, Most denominations are not  growing. The populaton in the United States is exploding&#x2026; but the church is  losing ground. We are in a steep state fo decline. 8</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">Unless a dramatic change occurs, the American church will  continue down the same path as the European church, which is all but dead. 8</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">The average church is losing the young generation, and those  young adults are not returning. 8</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">The rapid nature of the American church decline in the last  three decades rings a loud alarm bell. 12</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">Perhaps most startling is the gravity of how many exit the  church and the pace at which this exodus is occurring. Each generation that  passes loses more than he previous generation. Shock does not begin to describe  how we felt after reading the research results. The church is losing the  generational battle. Not only are we losing our nation to the ways of the  world, but we are not winning our own children in Christian  families. Multitudes are dropping out of church. But many are also not  claiminig the faith of their parents. 14</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">One survey states that only half of churches feel that they  do a good job of engaging the community and making others feel welcome.  Additionally, only 40 percent of these churches feel that they have any real  impact on the community or the world. This survey was taken among people within  the church. So 60 percent of the people in our churches do not believe they are  making an impact on their community. 55 56</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">more than two-thirds of young churchgoing adults in America  drop out of church between the ages of eighteen and twenty-two. 75</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">Particularly with the younger generation, church is another  time slot to fill. It is a check box on the weekly to-do list. The churches of  the dropouts were not a place where they wanted to spend free time. It was the  opposite. Church was just another time waster for them 75</p>\n      <h2 class=\"style16\"><em><strong>Email from a  denominational leader at SBC:</strong></em></h2>\n      <p class=\"style16\"><strong>From:</strong> Lynn mcgary [lnmcgary@hotmail.com]<br>\n          <strong>Sent:</strong> Tuesday, September 10, 2002 11:09 PM<br>\n          <strong>To:</strong> McCallumD<br>\n          <strong>Subject:</strong> Percentages Question</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">Dennis,</p>\n      \n      <p class=\"style16\">I  spoke with one of the Church Planter directors, Bill George, for Tennessee  Baptist Convention last Thursday to confirm that percentage number. Here  is what he said:</p>\n      \n      <p class=\"style16\">The  North American Mission Board (SBC)  published the number. The statistic is that 90%+ of church growth numbers  [presumably in SBC churches, but  not certain) is from Transfer and Progeny growth.</p>\n      \n      <p class=\"style16\">This  is considered an astonishing and alarming number, obviously. If you wish  to get a publishable reference, which I intend on doing myself, you could go  the the NAMB web-site and make a request. If I get the reference myself,  I would be happy to share it with you.</p>\n      <h2 class=\"style16\"><em><strong>&#x201C;Evangelicals fear the  loss of their teenagers&#x201D; New York Times, 10/6/06</strong></em></h2>\n      <p class=\"style16\">At an unusual series of  leadership meetings in 44 cities this fall, more than 6,000 pastors are hearing  dire forecasts from some of the biggest names in the conservative evangelical  movement. </p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">Their alarm has been  stoked by a highly suspect claim that if current trends continue, only 4  percent of teenagers will be &#x201C;Bible-believing Christians&#x201D; as adults. That would  be a sharp decline compared with 35 percent of the current generation of baby  boomers, and before that, 65 percent of the World War II generation. </p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">While some critics say  the statistics are greatly exaggerated (one evangelical magazine for youth  ministers dubbed it &#x201C;the 4 percent panic attack&#x201D;), there is widespread  consensus among evangelical leaders that they risk losing their teenagers.</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">The board of the  National Association of Evangelicals, an umbrella group representing 60  denominations and dozens of ministries, passed a resolution this year deploring  &#x201C;the epidemic of young people leaving the evangelical church.&#x201D;</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">The phenomenon may not  be that young evangelicals are abandoning their faith, but that they are  abandoning the institutional church, said Lauren Sandler, author of &#x201C;Righteous:  Dispatches from the Evangelical Youth Movement&#x201D; (Viking, 2006).</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">[Mr. Luce] said that a  current poll by the well-known evangelical pollster George Barna found that 5  percent of teenagers were Bible-believing Christians. Some criticize Mr.  Barna&#x2019;s methodology, however, for defining &#x201C;Bible-believing&#x201D; so narrowly that  it excludes most people who consider themselves Christians.</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\"><strong>Scott Thumma and  Warren Bird, <em>Not Who You Think They Are:  The Real Story of People Who Attend America&#x2019;s Megachurches</em>, (Hartford, CN:  Hartford Institute for Religious Research, 2009)</strong></p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">One might logically conclude that a large percentage of the  new people [at megachurches] are also new Christians. Certainly that is what  many megachurch pastors proclaim. However, nearly everyone, including visitors,  described himself or herself as a &#x201C;committed follower of Jesus Christ.&#x201D; &#x2026;barely  2% (roughly 500 people among the entire 24,900 survey respondents) said they  were <em>not </em>a committed follower of Christ. p. 5.</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">BUT&#x2026;</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">Roughly 90% of both  groups claimed quite regular participation in worship services&#x2026; Nearly 45% say  they never volunteer. 32% of megachurch attenders give nothing financially p. 7</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">The percentage of  formerly unchurched did vary somewhat across the 12 churches examined, ranging  from a high of 9% to a minimum of 3%. Nevertheless, these percentages are far  below what might be expected if megachurches brought in large numbers of  unsaved people. 16</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">42% of megachurch  attenders agreed with the statement &#x201C;I have very few close friends at this  church.&#x201D; &#x2026; almost a third of those at these churches over five years still  report having very few close friends there. 23</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\"><strong>R.

(U.S. Census Bureau)</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">Every year, 2.7 million church members fall into inactivity.  This translates into the realization that people are leaving the church. From  our research, we have found that they are leaving as hurting and wounded  victims&#x2014;of some kind of abuse, disillusionment, or just plain neglect! (U.S.  Census Bureau)</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">From 1990 to 2000, the combined membership of all Protestant  denominations in the USA declined by almost 5 million members (9.5 percent),  while the US population increased by 24 million (11 percent). (U.S. Census  Bureau)</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">Half of all churches in the US did not add any new members  to their ranks in the last two years.</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">One study that I did between 1992 and 2002 had surprising  results. I found that church attendance may be half what those survey results  stated. Many polls have indicated that the percentage of people who regularly  attend a church service in the United States is around 40% to 50%, 20% in  Canada, and 8% or less in Europe. But, when we started to count people from  denominational reports and compare to census data and University research data,  the numbers that were originally declared dropped by half!</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">The top reasons why people leave a church have to do with  not being connected in the church and/or being revolted by gossip and turned  away by conflict and strife while ineffective teaching and pastoral care are  also at hand. Another big turn off is being overly money-orientated so that  people feel the church wants their money but not them. The rest are important,  especially youth and children&#x2019;s ministry.</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\"><strong>Bobby Ross Jr. &#x201C;The  Workers Are Few: Gap exists between what large churches need and what  seminaries produce.&#x201D;<em> Christianity Today</em>, posted 7/14/2009 10:17AM</strong></p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">Cionca and other Christian leadership experts agreed that there  are few available pastors with the experience and skills necessary to lead  large churches.</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">The mere existence of pastor search firms&#x2014;which can earn $40,000  or more for a successful hunt&#x2014;underscores the difficulty of filling such  positions, said John Cionca, professor of ministry leadership at Bethel Seminary  in St. Paul.</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">Smaller churches also face a difficult challenge in filling  pulpits, experts stressed&#x2014;but for different reasons.</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">\"Larger, wealthier suburban churches have candidates looking  for them, so their questions are about finding the right fit,\" said Mark  Parker, assistant vice president of Harding University Graduate School of  Religion in Memphis, Tennessee. \"In smaller or more rural contexts, the  churches are the ones seeking a candidate &#x2026; because they cannot afford to pay a  full-time salary. </p>\n      <p class=\"style16\"><strong>Bomar, Chuck. <em>College Ministry 101: A Guide to Working  with 18-25 Year Olds,</em> (Zondervan, 2009)</strong></p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">We support our children until they finish high school; then  we take that support away. We assume they&#x2019;ll transition, but the rarely do.  After high school, many are left to figure out life for themselves. When the  church isn&#x2019;t there for them, they look to the world for guidance. 19</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">College-age people have been disconnecting from Christian  community for far too long. Most churches seem to struggle with the issue, yet the  pervasive lack of action suggests that they don&#x2019;t care as much as they say they  do. 20</p>\n      <p class=\"style16\">The longer I&#x2019;ve been involved in college-age ministry, the  more I realize it&#x2019;s often a back-burner ministry at best, one that doesn&#x2019;t get  much attention from the church leadership. 111</p>\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    </blockquote>    \n      </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"The Declining Church","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/books/satan/churchdecline.htm"}

THE SPIRITUAL  WAR</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">Spiritual war is real, according to the Bible. How should this affect our attitude and outlook? Compare a peacetime vs. a wartime mentality. <br>\n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">CHAPTER 2. WHO IS SATAN?</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">A major question arises when studying God's treatment of Satan: Why does he let Satan rampage on the earth? Why not destroy him or imprison him? Not all passages believed to be about Satan really are. Read an analysis of the key passages advanced as teaching on the origin and nature of Satan and see which ones should be taken that way. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">CHAPTER 3. THE REBELLION  SPREADS TO HUMANITY</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">Satan's first appearance in the Bible is typical of his actions throughout. See how his strategy in tempting Eve fit perfectly with his actions later in scripture. <br>\n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">CHAPTER 4. GOD&#x2019;S PLAN</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">Right from day one, God began unfolding his plan to counter the effects of Satan's work. But as the Old Testament develops, strange features begin to emerge: Prophecies of King Messiah don't match those of the Suffering Servant. But why would God leave out any reference to two comings? </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">CHAPTER 5. SATAN&#x2019;S ODD  BEHAVIOR</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">People were confused when Jesus finally came. Nobody understood his mission. But Satan behaved more strangely than anyone. Why would he conspire to take Jesus to the cross? And was was the result of this foolish action on history and on Satan? </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">CHAPTER 6. SPIRITUAL WARFARE  TODAY</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">Considering what has happened, what is Satan thinking today? What keeps him going? And what is he trying to do?</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">CHAPTER 7. OUR STRATEGY</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">What does God want of us when it comes to spiritual warfare? What is the plan?</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">CHAPTER 8. HOW THE SIDES  MATCH UP</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">Satan's power may be great, but we have even more. On the other hand, he has some other advangates that often cancel out our superior power in Christ.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">CHAPTER 9. BATTLING  SATAN INSIDE THE CHURCH</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">Satan agrees with God on the importance of the church. He won't wait for us to come to him. He aggressively moves in to corrupt the life of the body of Christ. His success in history should give us a new appreciation of his powers of persuasion and deception. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\"><span class=\"style18\">Section 2:<br>\n        Satan and You</span><br>\n        CHAPTER 10. YOUR  PERSONAL BATTLE WITH SATAN</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">Anyone who meets Christ will soon meet his enemy. When Satan comes at you, how will he come? If the fanciful pictures from Hollywood are wrong, what is the real picture? Maybe different than some think!</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">CHAPTER 11. SATAN&#x2019;S  TRUMP CARD</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">Satan's trump card is the beautiful system known as the <em>kosmos</em> in the New Testament. This system is really a kingdom ruled by Satan himself, according to Jesus. It keeps non-Christians form ever considering the claims of Christ. But it also mangles Christians spiritual lives, leaving them impotent for God.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">CHAPTER 12. COUNTERING  SATAN&#x2019;S MOVES</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">Scripture details weapons of warfare that are \"divinely powerful.\" Learning to wield these weapons is essential to victory in Christian living and ministry.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">CHAPTER 13. THE ARROWS  OF SATAN: TEMPTATION</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">How would you know if Satan was tempting you? What would you do about it? Understanding how Satan builds his fortresses is crucial to victory over temptation. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">CHAPTER 14. THE ARROWS  OF SATAN: ACCUSATION</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">Satan is called <em>diabolos</em> \"the accuser.\" Unless we learn how accusation works in all directions, we are doomed to a life of guilt, suspicion, anxiety, and defeat. Our friendships and even our marriage may be shredded. Christians who don't understand satanic accusation are helpless to defend themselves or counsel others.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">CHAPTER 15. SATAN AND  YOUR MINISTRY: DIVERSION</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">Every serving Christian poses a threat to Satan's kingdom that he cannot overlook. But his brilliant tactics for guiding zealous Christians into pointless efforts are remarkable. He may never have to oppose your ministry actively because he knows it is headed nowhere anyway. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">CHAPTER 16. SATAN AND  YOUR MINISTRY: OPPOSITION</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">If you are being used by God, spiritual warfare goes into high gear. People who minister for God meet Satan in a way nobody else does. Are you ready to withstand the vicious hammering Satan has planned for you?</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">CHAPTER 17. SATAN&#x2019;S  POWER MOVES</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">The occult, demonic oppression, and possession are not always real, but then there are the other times. Learn about possession and deliverance, including answers to some surprising questions: Why would the epistles never refer to deliverance from demon possession? Why didn't the Old Testament ever teach on this either? </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">CHAPTER 18. GOING  FORWARD</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">Understanding Satan is crucial to spiritual success. But focusing on him is a big mistake. Maintaining a Christ-centered focus in the midst of spiritual warfare is essential. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p><span class=\"style18\">Section 3<br>\n        For Further Study</span></p>\n      <p><span class=\"style16\">        Chapter 19&#x2014;Satan in the  Old Testament</span></p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p><span class=\"style16\">Why does the Old Testament remain silent about Satan in one book after another? How should we respond to liberal claims that the ancient Jews didn't know about Statan until the 200's BC? In those books where he does appear, what can we learn?</span></p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">Chapter 20&#x2014;Satan in the  New Testament</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">Without debate, most of our information about Satan comes from the New Testament--especially from Jesus. Learn why God delayed much of this revelation until the New Testament period, and survey the key themes revealed.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">Chapter 21&#x2014;Jesus and  Satan: Confrontation</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">The confrontation between God's Son and his enemy was a classic in Spiritual warfare. Study the temptations of Christ, including the underlying thinking.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">Appendix 1&#x2014;How Do We  Know if Satan Is Real?</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">According to recent surveys, nearly half of those calling themselves \"born again Christian\" don't believe Satan is a real personal being. The overwhelming majority of Americans don't believe it. How would you argue that Satan must be real? </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">Appendix  2&#x2014;Problems in Old Testament Predictions of<br>\n&#xA0;the Suffering Servant</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">Why don't the predictions of Jesus' first coming ever identify him as Messiah? Why are there no references to two comings? Why are the contexts for some messianic prophecy so confusing? God must have known this would create confusion.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">Appendix 3&#x2014;Jesus&#x2019;  Teaching On His Own Mission</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">At the last supper, Jesus told the disciples, &#x201C;There  is so much more I want to tell you, but you can&#x2019;t bear it now&#x201D; and \"I  have spoken of these matters in parables, but the time will come when this will  not be necessary, and I will tell you plainly all about the Father.\" (Jn 16:22, 25). Why did Jesus have to wait to tell them plainly of the Father? Why did he want to tell them more, but could not? </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">Appendix 4&#x2014;Assessing  God&#x2019;s Secrecy</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">Paul repeatedly refers to the \"mystery hidden for long ages past\" but recently revealed. He also refers to \"<span lang=\"en-us\">the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past</span>...\" (Rom. 16:25). Why would God need to keep anything secret? </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">Satan&#x2019;s Blindness</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">Is it really possible that one as brilliant as Satan failed to understand what Jesus was doing? How could this be, considering Jesus clearly said what would happen? </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"style16\">Were All People So  Blind, and Should They Have Been?</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"style16\">Some passages suggest key people did understand the mystery, or at least they should have. </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      \n      \n    <br>  \n      </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Satan and His Kingdom","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/books/satan/contents.html"}

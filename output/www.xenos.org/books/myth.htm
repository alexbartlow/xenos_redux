DeLashmutt and McCallum invite us to revel in the hope that intimacy \n        isn't based on finding the right person, but on becoming the right person&#x97;a \n        man or woman of depth, passion and godly character.\"</p>\n      <p> <i>Dr. Dan B.

Your points are carefully \n        explored or supported from a scriptural foundation, and throughout you \n        present hard-to-hear truths in such a kind, caring manner that your readers \n        can't help but pay attention. . . I loved it!\"</p>\n      <p><i>Kathy Olsen, Editor, Tyndale House Publishers</i></p>\n      <p><br>\n        \"McCallum and DeLashmutt argue that finding the right person is secondary \n        to becoming the right person, and that the choice of who and when to marry \n        must be rooted in a different value system than mere physical and emotional \n        attraction.\"</p>\n      <p>\"(<i>Spiritual Relationships That Last</i>) is great for singles \n        wondering how to know they are ready for marriage, a well as study groups \n        and marriage preparation classes.

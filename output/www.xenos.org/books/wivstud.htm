I have referred to myself in the third person in order to keep the focus\non the text. We have seen excellent results using this book as a basis for both small\ngroup and classroom study. The book challenges young and mature Christians alike to seek\nmaturity in Christ at all costs, and to do so through the power of God, not self-effort.\nRomans 5-8 is the most complete and exciting explanation of Christian growth in any of the\nletters of Paul. I hope you are challenged and edified by this wonderful passage that\nnever grows old. \n\n</p><dir>\n  <b></b><p>How to lead a study based on this book:</p>\n</dir>\n\n<p>First discuss the idea of going through the book with the group, and proceed only if\nthey agree to do the work. <i>Walking in Victory</i> is not a typical Sunday School\nquarterly, and will require careful reading, thought, and prayer on the part of your group\nmembers. If you, the leader(s), have read the book and benefited from it, you should be\nable to convince the members of the group they, too, will benefit. People usually respond\nto a challenge, and may like the idea that they are not just going to go over simple\nideas.</p>\n\n<p>Obtain a copy of <i>Walking in Victory</i> for each member of the group. If you cannot\nget quantity pricing from your local bookstore, come to the Xenos Home Page\n(http://www.xenos.org) and order at substantial discount.</p>\n\n<p>This study guide is designed for leader-facilitated discussion. The leader will not be\nlecturing, unless for short five minute introductions. Participation is a preferable way\nto learn. You will be reading in the group, so at least most of the members need their own\ncopy to follow along. <i>Walking in Victory</i> is written very tight, so members won't\nhave to read long passages before you have material to discuss. Unlike most books, this\nbook can be read in the group without boring your members.</p>\n\n<p>The best results come when the members answer the questions before coming to the group,\nand then compare their work. But you may also answer them together in the group after\nreading. With some questions, possible answers have been given. When copying the study\nguide for the group, be sure to mask these suggested answers out by making them hidden\ntext, and printing with hidden text turned off. In Word 6.0 this is done in the tools menu\nunder options/print. Check the box for hidden text to print, and leave it unchecked to\nprint for the discussion guide.</p>\n\n<p>An average study will include about fifteen or twenty minutes of reading, and twenty to\nthirty or more minutes of discussion based on the questions in this guide.</p>\n\n<p>Please feel free to send me feedback about problems or positive results by email, to\nmccallumd@xenos.org, or come to the Xenos Web Site at http://www.xenos.org,\nand send me response there. \n\n</p><dir>\n  <dir>\n    <b></b><p>General introduction</p>\n  </dir>\n</dir>\n\n<p>Welcome to a study of Romans 5 through 8 using the book, <i>Walking in Victory</i>, by\nDennis McCallum. Prepare to have all your ideas about Christian growth challenged, shaken\ndown, and even shattered by a passage of Scripture that flies in the face of every form of\nhuman religious thinking! Ask God to help you stick with this study faithfully, and to\nbenefit fully from Paul's deepest discussion of Christian identity. \n\n</p><dir>\n  <dir>\n    <b></b><p>Chapter 1<br>\n    Who Are You?</p>\n  </dir>\n</dir>\n\n<p>After reading through the text, return to reconsider certain points.</p>\n\n<p>The author claims: \n\n</p><dir>\n  <dir>\n    <dir>\n      <dir>\n        <p>We will be looking at God's answers to human nature--your nature--as detailed in Romans\n        chapters 5 through 8. Any Christian who understands and applies this remarkable passage\n        will see exciting change in his or her life -- a change not only in outward action but\n        also in inner attitudes and thought patterns. Why not commit yourself before God to invest\n        a few hours to complete this study? As you do, ask God to grant you the full understanding\n        He wants you to have of this vital passage. p. 6</p>\n      </dir>\n    </dir>\n  </dir>\n</dir>\n\n<p>Are you ready to make this commitment? If so, before long we will have this section of\nRomans--one of the most important in the Bible--in our hearts and lives. \n\n</p><dir>\n  <b></b><p>The Negative Mandate</p>\n</dir>\n\n<p>He also states: \n\n</p><dir>\n  <dir>\n    <dir>\n      <dir>\n        <p>. . . Before we can experience God&#x92;s &#x91;yes&#x92;, we have to comprehend his\n        &#x91;no&#x92;.... God's answer to our problems has to do with our being \"in\n        Christ.\" But before we can appreciate what that means, we have to understand what it\n        means to be \"in Adam.\"</p>\n      </dir>\n      <p>&#xB7; Read Matthew 23:25-28. Some of our biggest problems don't\n      show on the outside.</p>\n      <p>&#xB7; On page 11 the author presents a list of six typical\n      negatives in our lives.</p>\n      <p>&#xB7; Read each of these and prayerfully consider which ones\n      you can identify with.</p>\n    </dir>\n  </dir>\n</dir>\n\n<p>Rate your reaction to the following: (1=not much, 5=frequent, painful struggle)</p>\n\n<p>I am struggling with my feelings, especially sorrow</p>\n\n<p>1 2 3 4 5</p>\n\n<p>I am struggling with envy and/or bitterness</p>\n\n<p>1 2 3 4 5</p>\n\n<p>I am struggling with feelings of inferiority</p>\n\n<p>1 2 3 4 5</p>\n\n<p>I am struggling with the sense that I am failing</p>\n\n<p>1 2 3 4 5</p>\n\n<p>I am angry that people aren't appreciating me enough</p>\n\n<p>1 2 3 4 5</p>\n\n<p>People around me seem very unreasonable</p>\n\n<p>1 2 3 4 5</p>\n\n<p>I am worried about aging and death</p>\n\n<p>1 2 3 4 5</p>\n\n<p>My walk with God seems dry or stale</p>\n\n<p>1 2 3 4 5</p>\n\n<p>I'm having trouble with my children, and I'm not satisfied with my responses</p>\n\n<p>1 2 3 4 5</p>\n\n<p>Do you see anything here that could be motivation for seeking spiritual maturity at any\nprice? \n\n</p><dir>\n  <b></b><p>The positive mandate</p>\n</dir>\n\n<p>Which of these possible outcomes looks attractive to you?

Let's go!\n\n</p><dir>\n  <b></b><p>Seeking change</p>\n</dir>\n\n<p>Go around the room, having members take turns reading sections in chapter 1. The whole\nchapter takes only a few minutes to read.</p>\n\n<p>Focus on the last section: Doing and Being. McCallum says: \n\n</p><dir>\n  <dir>\n    <dir>\n      <dir>\n        <i></i><p>Doing arises out of <i>being.</i> You <i>do</i> what you <i>do</i> because you <i>are</i>\n        what you <i>are&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. </i>What we <i>do</i> arises out of what we <i>are</i>\n        . . . . If we focus only on changing our behaviors, we miss the real point. . . . The\n        point is not just that we <i>do</i> the wrong thing, but that we <i>are</i> the wrong\n        thing! pg.9</p>\n      </dir>\n    </dir>\n  </dir>\n</dir>\n\n<p>Many Christian leaders and writers focus on changing what we do as Christians. Paul\nalso speaks about the need to change our behavior, but here, we seem to be seeing an\nemphasis, not on <i>behavior</i>, but on <i>identity</i>. \n\n</p><dir>\n  <dir>\n    <dir>\n      <dir>\n        <dir>\n          <p>&#xB7; Have you ever approached spiritual\n          growth by trying to behave better?</p>\n          <p>&#xB7; Have you ever dealt with pain in relationships by trying\n          to change the other person's behavior?</p>\n          <p>&#xB7; Have you ever thought that the key to further progress in\n          your life is to change your circumstances?</p>\n          <p>&#xB7; Have you ever felt frustrated that, even though you try\n          to change, nothing seems to be happening?</p>\n        </dir>\n      </dir>\n    </dir>\n  </dir>\n</dir>\n\n<p>What if you are missing something so important it could defeat all your best efforts to\ngrow? Even those of us who know all about our identity in Christ will find, if we are\nhonest, that we repeatedly fall back into outward performance orientation. \n\n</p><dir>\n  <dir>\n    <b></b><p><a name=\"DDE_LINK11\">Chapter 2<br>\n    As In Adam, So In Christ</a></p>\n  </dir>\n</dir>\n\n<p>We are born with an identity in Adam, according to Romans 5 and parallel passages. The\nimportance of this teaching is not just that we have this identity, but how we got it--the\nprinciple of <i>federal headship</i>. This principle, so important for understanding our\nnegative traits, is also the principle by which God wants to grant us victory over sin,\nand power to live for him.</p>\n\n<p>Have members read sections of the chapter until done. Then:</p>\n\n<p>Read Psalms 51:5 and Ephesians 2:1,3 \n\n</p><dir>\n  <dir>\n    <dir>\n      <p>&#xB7; Discuss what these two passages describe. How does the\n      biblical view of human nature compare to other religions? Have you seen confirmation of\n      the biblical view in your life? In history? Have you ever noticed that the forbidden fruit\n      is sweeter? That rebellion comes naturally? What about children? Are they already fallen?\n      Or do they learn their fallenness from adults?</p>\n      <p>&#xB7; Discuss how we receive this sin nature. Why did Adam's\n      sin affect his offspring? Discuss the definition of federal headship. Make sure all\n      members of the group understand it. Return to the illustration on page 17 if necessary.</p><dir>\n        <p>The author states, \"Because Adam acted for us in this way [his rebellion],\n        bestowing a certain nature and identity upon us, he is called our federal head. Adam\n        stands at the source of a humanity that is the way it is because Adam -- our head, our\n        source -- acted for all of us. (p.13)\"</p>\n      </dir>\n      <p>&#xB7; What are the problems you see with this doctrine? Does\n      anyone in your group feel like it's unfair that we have inherited a sin nature from Adam\n      when we were neither present nor made the choice he did?</p>\n      <p>&#xB7; The nature we inherit from Adam describes the \"half\n      empty glass.\" What hope can you see in this principle?</p>\n    </dir>\n    <b><p>Chapter 3</p><br>\n    Losing Our Identity <br>\n    in Adam</b>\n  </dir>\n</dir>\n\n<p>Hopefully, by now we see that our problems are much deeper than outward actions. In\nfact, our actions are really only symptoms of the deeper problem--our very identity! If we\nwant real change we have to lose our identity in Adam. Remember the author's distinction,\nlosing our identity in Adam is different from losing our sin nature. This will be examined\nin more detail later.</p>\n\n<p>Read through Chapter 3 together. \n\n</p><dir>\n  <dir>\n    <dir>\n      <p>&#xB7; <i>True or False? </i>Attempting to control our external\n      behaviors is pure legalism and will never produce results. Why do you think this is true\n      or false?</p><dir>\n        <dir>\n          <i></i><p>This is a false statement, according to McCallum. \"There is\n          nothing wrong with controlling negative symptoms. (p.20)\" It becomes a problem only\n          \"when it is the only thing we do. It becomes a serious problem when we begin to\n          define our spiritual state by how well the battle with behavior is going.\" p.20</p>\n        </dir>\n      </dir>\n      <p>&#xB7; Have someone read Romans 6:3-4. Discuss what Paul\n      means when he says we are \"baptized into Christ's death and resurrection.\" What\n      arguments would favor understanding this baptism as referring to water baptism? What\n      arguments favor spiritual baptism into Christ (ICorinthians&#xA0;12:13)?</p><dir>\n        <dir>\n          <i></i><p>Make sure the members in the group understand that the word\n          \"baptized\" (or baptizo<i> - Greek) means more literally \"placed\n          into.\" The Christian has been placed into Christ. We now have a NEW identity of being\n          with or in Christ. In other words what is true of Christ becomes true of us.</i></p>\n        </dir>\n      </dir>\n      <p>&#xB7; Read 1 Corinthians 15:45. According to this verse,\n      Jesus is a federal head just as Adam was. We didn't feel anything when we got our identity\n      in Adam, and yet were directly impacted by what he did. (also read 1 Corinthians\n      15:21-22). Will we feel anything when we receive our new identity from Christ? Can we\n      sense ourselves dying or resurrecting?</p>\n      <p>&#xB7; Discuss what people think the term \"identity\"\n      means. What effect does your sense of identity have on your life?</p>\n      <p>&#xB7; Review the table on pages 20 - 21 to highlight the\n      importance of the concept of our position in Christ. Do the group members feel like they\n      are really experiencing the full impact they should from these truths?</p><dir>\n        <dir>\n          <i></i><p>For example, you might feel very insecure in your relationship with\n          your spouse. Subsequently you demand regular proof from him or her of their allegiance\n          This would undoubtedly drive a wedge between the two of you. Do the members of the group\n          understand what it means to draw their security from Christ? This has to do with our\n          identity in him. Now imagine how freeing it would be if you would experience security and\n          love regardless<i> of the actions of your spouse. </i></p>\n        </dir>\n      </dir>\n    </dir>\n    <b><p>Chapter 4</p><br>\n    Identity: What Is It, and <br>\n    How Do We Perceive It?<dir>\n      </dir></b><p>This chapter includes some abstract material, which can be a problem with\n      some concrete thinkers.

They are like ourselves in\n          that they, too, are finite and do not possess any inherent position of authority to make\n          these determinations. Our parents, teachers, friends, relatives, the media, and even our\n          own observations all give input to the formation of our identity. What we think is\n          important and what we think of ourselves is primarily determined through these external\n          finite reference points. The conclusions we draw based on these might be true (consistent\n          with what is actually true about us) or might not be. Most likely we simply view things\n          the way the important people in our lives viewed them. Obviously if our conclusions are\n          inaccurate, and our actions and attitudes are derived from our sense of who we are, then\n          we have a miserable life ahead of us to one degree or another.</p>\n          <p>An external <u>infinite</u> reference point would be a point that stands\n          above all of creation and is inherently in a position of authority. This would be an\n          absolute point of reference, not a relative one. God doesn't need to compare himself to\n          anyone or anything to determine who he is, rather, he is the standard. What he says is\n          true about the identity or significance of anything would be the final word, regardless of\n          what all the finite reference points believed.</p>\n        </dir>\n      </dir>\n      <p>&#xB7; If we compared other's view of us to God's view of\n      us, what would we discover?

What impact would such a difference have on my\n      life?</p><dir>\n        <dir>\n          <i></i><p>Possible answers:</p>\n          <p>Our attitudes and behaviors grow out of who we are.

Therefore, His view of\n          us is the real view of us.

The client repeats in confident tones that he or she is\n          a good person, is worthwhile, has a lot to offer, etc., etc. The problem with this view is\n          that the reference point for changing how a person thinks and feels about himself, is\n          himself, and is therefore completely arbitrary. We could decide we are superhuman or that\n          we are worthless, but either conclusion would have no necessary correspondence with\n          reality.</p>\n          <p>2) Others-Affirmation:</p>\n          <i></i><p>Some counselors urge the client to hang around with people who\n          are affirming and willing to remind us why we are significant. The problem with this\n          approach is two-fold. First, the people upon whom we are depending establish our sense of\n          identity are as finite as we, ourselves. Second, their opinion of us is subject to change\n          based on how we've treated them. Therefore we may well become the slaves of those we hope\n          will establish our sense of identity. The result is that we live for the approval of\n          others -- we become man-pleasers: a position that is incompatible with pleasing God\n          (Galatians 1:10; 2 Corinthians 10:12).</p>\n        </dir>\n      </dir>\n    </dir>\n  </dir>\n\n\n<p>Our sense of identity is our knowledge of who we are, and why we matter. We either make\nup an identity based on nothing more than our hunch about who we are, or we find out who\nwe really are by consulting the God who created us. In the next chapter, we begin to\nconsider how to appropriate God's view of us. \n\n</p><dir>\n  <dir>\n    <b></b><p>Chapter 5<br>\n    Knowing, Believing, <br>\n    Reckoning</p>\n  </dir>\n</dir>\n\n<p>Have someone in the group read Romans 6:3-10 (<u>not</u> 8:3-10 as the book suggests) \n\n</p><dir>\n  <dir>\n    <dir>\n      <p>In this passage, we see the \"baptized into\" language.

These are the passages in\n          which God tells us how to act, what to do, and what attitudes to adopt.</p>\n          <p>What is the key relationship between these two as found in the\n          Bible?</p>\n          <i></i><p>Anything that God asks us to do is in response to what he\n          already has done, is doing, or will do.</p>\n          <p>What is the opposite of this perspective that many of us, even\n          as Christians, fall into?</p>\n          <i></i><p>That we do things in order to<i> gain God&#x92;s\n          acceptance, approval, and blessings.</i></p>\n          <p>How do we know when we have fallen into this mentality?</p>\n          <i></i><p>One unfortunate sign of this is when our circumstances are\n          bad we might try \"pedaling harder\" to get God to come through for us.

They claim that the negative effect of the law (stimulating sin) is only\nfor non-Christians. Their position requires that Romans 7 be referring to the non\nChristian's struggle with law, not with a Christian's struggle.

If some or all members believe the latter, you should definitely take the time to try\nto settle on an interpretation of Romans 7 and its parallels. If, on the other hand, the\nmembers already agree with <i>Walking in Victory</i> and understand the exegesis of Romans\n7, you may decide to skip this part of the study and focus on the application points\nregarding legalism later in the chapter.

(Mt.5:21-48)\" Yes, that is what Jesus says. Unqualified obedience is his\n      standard. The author goes on, saying, \"Faith obeys. Unbelief rebels.

Has worry about\n      your own growth ever drawn your attention away from Christ himself?</p>\n      <p>McCallum says, \"Only those who know where they are headed eternally can be\n      expected to welcome suffering.\" How can reflecting on our future with God give us\n      courage to face trial?</p>\n    \n    <b><p>Chapter 20:<br>\n    How It All Adds Up</p><dir>\n      </dir></b><p>Do not skip this chapter! The things we have been discussing have been too\n      abstract for good assimilation into the average person's daily life. We need a living\n      example of how the principles in this book work together.</p>\n      <p>No better example could be imagined than the author of our passages in Romans. Read\n      this chapter (somewhat longer than most) section by section, stopping to talk as needed.\n      Do you agree with the conclusions McCallum draws from the biographical profile of Paul\n      near the end of his life? Do you find it exciting to contemplate some of these features\n      manifesting themselves more and more in your own life?</p>\n    \n  \n\n&#xA0;\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body></div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"STUDY GUIDE","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/books/wivstud.htm"}

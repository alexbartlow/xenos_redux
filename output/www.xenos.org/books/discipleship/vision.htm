The first two sections are designed to help us pray for vision. The last three sections are questionnaires designed to be answered by the disciple maker thus increasing their vision. </p> <h2>Part One: Focused Prayer</h2> <p>It's good to have a weekly time for focused prayer. For example, every Sunday at 12:00 noon I will pray for at least a half an hour about all the different people I would like to serve. This sheet of paper is simply a way to keep our minds on track. First, we make a list in the far left column of all the people we mean to pray for. Secondly, we reflect in prayer about any positive or negative observations we have had recently. Third, we ask God if any of our thoughts would be good to bring up with the person at this time.</p> <table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tbody><tr><th width=\"25%\"><p>Person</p></th> <th width=\"25%\"><p>Positives</p></th> <th width=\"25%\"><p>Negatives</p></th> <th width=\"25%\"><p>Is there anything to bring up now?</p></th> </tr><tr><td width=\"25%\" valign=\"top\">  </td> <td width=\"25%\" valign=\"top\">&#xA0;</td> <td width=\"25%\" valign=\"top\">&#xA0;</td> <td width=\"25%\" valign=\"top\">&#xA0;</td> </tr></tbody></table><h2><b><i>Part Two: In-depth Prayer</i></b></h2> <p>Every 6 months or so, it's a good idea to do a more big-picture prayer evaluation. It would be nice if these prayerful reflections were saved and could be accessed. You can do one of these prayer evaluations for yourself, your family, or your friends. If you are discipling someone, this type exercise could be completely revitalizing to your vision. Prayerfully analyze how the one you're praying for has grown in the past 6 months. Have there been victories in the areas of character, relationships, equipping, or ministry? Share your insights to reinforce vision.</p> <p><strong>Character</strong> = Has he overcome bad habits? Has she begun new good habits? Is he demonstrating more fruit of the Spirit?</p> <p><strong>Relationships</strong> = Does she have a healthy amount of friends? Has he been trying to meet new people? Are her relational habits healthier than before?</p> <p><strong>Equipping</strong> = What has he learned? What has she been reading/studying? Has he been sharing new knowledge with others?</p> <p><strong>Ministry</strong> = Has she been serving others? Does he have a burden to develop a personal ministry? Does she share their faith?</p> <table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"590\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"118\" valign=\"top\"><p>Person</p></td> <td width=\"118\" valign=\"top\"><p>Character</p></td> <td width=\"118\" valign=\"top\"><p>Relation-ships</p></td> <td width=\"118\" valign=\"top\"><p>Equipping</p></td> <td width=\"118\" valign=\"top\"><p>Ministry</p></td> </tr><tr><td width=\"118\" valign=\"top\">&#xA0;</td> <td width=\"118\" valign=\"top\">&#xA0;</td> <td width=\"118\" valign=\"top\">&#xA0;</td> <td width=\"118\" valign=\"top\">&#xA0;</td> <td width=\"118\" valign=\"top\">&#xA0;</td> </tr></tbody></table><h2><b><i>&#xA0;&#xA0;<br> Part Three: Follow-up Questionnaire </i></b></h2> <p>Introduction: This questionnaire can be filled out for anyone who is trying to evangelize, establish, or pre-disciple someone. In order to get vision, we need to understand where this person is coming from. If you are discipling someone, you could give this worksheet to them in order to help them in their attempts to reach out to friends. You could talk about the questions together and challenge them to learn more about their friends.</p> <p>What is his/her worldview?</p> <p>[If not Christian] = Why not? Does he/she believe in a Creator God? What are their possible problems with God? What is their life story? How could their past play into their view of God?</p> <p>What important role could they play if they went for God? What are altruistic tendencies or natural gifts do they have?</p> <p>[If Christian] = Can they remember a point in their life when they asked Christ into their lives? Do they believe they are a part of God's Body, going to spend eternity with God? Do they understand that their sins are forgiven, they have a new position before God, and they are eternally secure?</p> <p>Do they understand the importance of evangelism; are they reaching out to family and friends?</p> <p>What possible roadblocks exist between them and walking with God? How might Satan try to take them out?</p> <p>What important role can/do they play in the Body? What serving tendencies or spiritual gifts can you see them having?</p> <h2><b><i>Part Four: Disciple-Making Questionnaire</i></b></h2> <p>This is a worksheet is meant to be filled out once per person preferably at the beginning of a new relationship. Keep it, so that in 6 months or a year you can refer back and see the growth that has occurred. If you fill out the sheet privately and are unable to answer a question, ask your friend what the answer is. In this way you will become better acquainted with their spirituality. Another option is filling out the questionnaire with your friend. My suggestion if you choose to do this, is that you give the sheet to them after a period of time (6 months to a year) to show them how they've grown.</p> <p>Have they made the second decision: to become a disciple, to be committed to spiritual growth, and to give their life up to the leadership of God?</p> <h3><b>Part 1 &#x2013; The means of growth</b></h3> <h4>The Bible:</h4> <p>Do they read the word?</p> <p>Do they understand its importance?</p> <p>Do they talk about what they're learning in it?</p> <p>Do they know how to properly interpret it?</p> <p>Are they studying the Bible with anyone?</p> <p>If this area is a weakness, what do you plan to do about it right now (if anything)? If this area is a strength, how can you encourage them?</p> <h4>Prayer</h4> <p>Do they pray privately?</p> <p>Do they pray publicly?</p> <p>Do they understand the importance of prayer?</p> <p>Do they pray for others and for themselves?</p> <p>If this area is a weakness, what do you plan to do about it right now (if anything)?

Do they meet and talk to new people at meetings?</p> <p>Do they understand that they have an important impact &#x2013; that their absence would be damaging?</p> <p>If this area is a weakness, what do you plan to do about it right now (if anything)? If this area is a strength, how can you encourage them?</p> <h4>Suffering/ Discipline of the Holy Spirit</h4> <p>Do they expect suffering and dry times in their faith?</p> <p>Do they understand how to respond to suffering and how it can be used for the good in their lives?</p> <p>What sinful response to suffering are they the most likely to indulge in (i.e. blaming, shutting people out, depression, outbursts of anger, etc.)</p> <p>If this area is a weakness, what do you plan to do about it right now (if anything)? If this area is a strength, how can you encourage them?</p> <h4>Ministry/Serving love</h4> <p>Do they reach out to friends and family?</p> <p>What help can you offer with evangelism (i.e. giving them salvation verses to use, going with them to meet their friends, asking them about their testimony, etc.)?</p> <p>Do they have a vision for disciple-making?</p> <p>Is there someone they could begin discipling?</p> <p>What help can you offer with disciple-making?</p> <p>In which ways are they gifted?</p> <p>Do they use their abilities to serve?</p> <p>Are they able to teach others?</p> <p>Do they have a vision for servant leadership?</p> <p>Do they give financially and take Christian classes?</p> <p>What would hold them back from leadership?</p> <p>What help can you offer with leadership?</p> <h3><b>Part 2 &#x2013; Character/ Relationships</b></h3> <h4>Character</h4> <p>How does past damage play in to their lives?</p> <p>What is their attitude about sin or weaknesses in their lives (are they too hard on themselves, defensive, self-righteous, etc.)?</p> <p>Are there any serious sin problems that need to be addressed (i.e. sexual immorality, addiction, factious, swindling, excessive laziness, excessive greed, etc.)?</p> <p>We all have a number of sin areas we struggle with; What other sin areas are present that you are aware of (i.e. anger, dishonesty, bitterness, infantilism, over- independence, arrogance, gossip, legalism, grace-abusing, lack of loving action, etc.)?</p> <h4>Relationships</h4> <p>Do they have a problem with authorities?</p> <p>What important relationships are they in and are they healthy?</p> <p>What new relationships are they forming, and how is it going?</p> <p>What possible roadblocks exist in their relationships (i.e. are they open? Are they abrasive? Etc.)?</p> <p>Are they lonely?</p> <p>Do they understand that it's more important to focus on how we love than how we are loved?</p> <p><b>Part 3 &#x2013; Strategy</b></p> <p>Look over your answers and write down what the big picture is in one or two sentences.</p> <p>Which things can you encourage them on right now?</p> <p>Which problem area needs to be addressed first, and how do you plan to address it?</p> <p>What are some ideas about what you could study together?</p> <p>What things can you wait to bring up with them?

What are your agreements/ disagreements?</p>   <br clear=\"all\"> <br clear=\"all\">     </td> </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Organic Disciplemaking","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/books/discipleship/vision.htm"}

Trust hands over to God what God has given us\n          and says, ‘Keep it Lord, and use it, for I cannot.’ Then\n          comes holy confidence and assurance of soul which prevents us from ever\n          being disturbed under any circumstances whatever, and out of that confidence\n          there comes a boldness which enables us to act for the glory of God.\n          Faith, when it has conceived, brings forth trust; trust when finished,\n          brings forth confidence and boldness.” H.W. Webb-Peploe “<i>Life\n            of Privilege</i>” </p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <h3><b>3 Attitudes to avoid </b></h3>\n      <ol>\n        <li><b> Fear – Insecurity with ministry </b> </li>\n        <blockquote>\n          <p>“The God most of us worship is too small. The God of most Christians\n            seems anemic, weak, and limited. He does not have the capacity to make\n            a difference, or turn things around. The God most of us serve resembles\n            more the flickering of a candle than the burning of the noonday sun.\n            One reason for this is that we do not understand God’s sovereignty.\n            We have allowed God to be everywhere but on His throne, and we have paid\n            dearly in our own spiritual failure and weakness and limited power because\n            the God we talk about has little to do with the sovereign God of the\n            universe… Only when you understand that this is the kind of God\n            with whom we have to do will you take seriously the issue of His authority. ” Tony\n            Evans.

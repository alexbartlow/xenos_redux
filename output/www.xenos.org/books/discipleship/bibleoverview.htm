This paper is ideal for someone\n        who knows nothing about the story of the Bible. Also, many people are\n        familiar with the new testament, but not the old. In that case, the old\n        testament section can be studied without the new testament section.

Humans rebel against\n        God, causing a separation between them and God. God calls Abraham and\n        begins to work with him and his descendants: Isaac (Gen 22), Jacob (Gen.\n        27-28), and the twelve tribes (Gen. 35:22-29; 49:1-28). </p>\n      <p>Read: Gen. 1-3; 12:1-3 </p>\n      <h4>Questions: </h4>\n      <ul>\n        <li> What were people like before the fall? See how many features of\n          unfallen humans you can find in Chapter 2. </li>\n        <li> Why did humans fall? What tempted them? </li>\n        <li> How is God foreshadowing his plan of reconciliation? </li>\n        <li> What role does the chosen nation of Israel play in God&#x2019;s plan? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Week 2 = Exodus </h3>\n      <p>History: God provides for the Israeli people by bringing them into the\n        land of Goshen , in Egypt . Here they have a place of their own with\n        plenty of food. Later, the Egyptians enslave them, and God raises up\n        Moses to lead them out of slavery. God performs amazing miracles and\n        gives the people his moral law (Ex.19-20). </p>\n      <p>Read: Gen. 45:4-11; Ex. 13:17-14:31; Deut. 8. </p>\n      <h4>Questions: </h4>\n      <ul>\n        <li> How is God providing for his people? </li>\n        <li> What temptations are the people succumbing to? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Week 3 = Conquest </h3>\n      <p>History: The Israelites are afraid to enter God&#x2019;s Promised Land,\n        and subsequently wander the desert for 40 years. After Moses&#x2019; death,\n        Joshua leads the people into the land. </p>\n      <p>Read: Num. 13-14; Josh. 1-5 </p>\n      <h4>Questions: </h4>\n      <ul>\n        <li> What lessons about leadership can be learned from Joshua? </li>\n        <li> What lessons can we learn about trusting God? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Week 4 = Judges </h3>\n      <p>History: Israel is a theocracy: run by God and his appointed judges\n        as opposed to human government. Israel goes through many cycles where\n        they rebel, God removes his protection, a neighboring nation invades,\n        they cry out to God, God raises up a judge to restore them, they rebel\n        again, on and on. </p>\n      <p>Read: Judges 6-8; 13:24-16:31 </p>\n      <h4>Questions: </h4>\n      <ul>\n        <li> What lessons about faith and prayer can be learned by Gideon? </li>\n        <li> What lessons can be learned by the life of Samson? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Week 5 = Monarchy </h3>\n      <p>History: Israel asks for a king and God grants their request, giving\n        them Saul as their first king. Saul is succeeded by David, a man &#x201C;after\n        God&#x2019;s own heart&#x201D;. David&#x2019;s son Solomon builds the first\n        Temple . </p>\n      <p>Read: 1 Sam. 15-16; 2 Sam.7 </p>\n      <h4>Questions: </h4>\n      <ul>\n        <li> How were Saul and David different? </li>\n        <li> What promises does God make to David and what do they mean? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Week 6 = Exile </h3>\n      <p>History: The Israeli nation is split in two with 10 tribes to the north\n        ( Israel ), and 2 tribes to the south ( Judah ). After rejecting God,\n        they are overthrown and exiled into other lands ( Israel is conquered\n        by Assyria in 722B.C.E., and Judah by Babylon in 586B.C.E.) </p>\n      <p>Read: Daniel 1-4:3 </p>\n      <h4>Questions: </h4>\n      <ul>\n        <li> How did Daniel and his friends interact with their new culture? </li>\n        <li> How was God helping them? </li>\n        <li> What did their choices show those around them? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Week 7 = Rebuilding </h3>\n      <p>History: Ezra, Nehemiah, and others get permission to return home and\n        rebuild their lost city wall and temple. </p>\n      <p>Read: Neh. 1-5 </p>\n      <h4>Questions: </h4>\n      <ul>\n        <li> How was Nehemiah&#x2019;s prayer answered (ch.1-2)? </li>\n        <li> What can we learn about leadership from Nehemiah&#x2019;s example? </li>\n        <li> What can we learn about overcoming discouragement and opposition? </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h2>New Testament </h2>\n      <h3>Historical Setting: </h3>\n      <p>The Greeks become a superpower under the leadership of Alexander the\n        great. During the Greek era, Greek culture and language became widespread\n        in Palestine . When the Romans came to power they built paved roads,\n        allowed Jewish local leaders, and created a common Roman citizenship.\n        These were the conditions Jesus was born into, allowing news of Him to\n        spread easily. Jewish religious fluctuation created the desire to worship\n        at the central sanctuary of the Temple                         &#x2013; causing\n        all devout Jews to make pilgrimages to Jerusalem . Jews of many different\n        countries could take the news about Christ home with them. The paved\n        roads and common Greek language allowed early missionaries like Paul\n        to travel and communicate with relative ease. Jewish synagogues, which\n        had been introduced during the Greek era, were perfect places for missionaries\n        to begin their ministries in when they came to a new city . </p>\n      \n      <h3>Important Definitions in the New Testament </h3>\n      <h4>Jewish Religious Groups: </h4>\n      <p>Pharisees = This was a group of religious zealots that began in response\n        to the Hellenization that was happening during the Greek era. They had\n        no political power, but were respected. They sought to interpret and\n        follow the Law and traditions of Rabbis carefully. </p>\n      <p>Rabbi = A rabbi was a Jewish teacher and mentor. </p>\n      <p>Sadducees = This group was descended from the Maccabean aristocracy\n        and believed that there were no spirits and no resurrection from the\n        dead. </p>\n      <p>Scribes = Ezra was the first scribe. Scribes were law experts, or lawyers,\n        and often taught children the Law. </p>\n      <p>Sanhedrin = 70 of the top Jews of the day were given the right to exercise\n        authority in judging certain matters </p>\n      <h4>Jewish Religious Places: </h4>\n      <p>Synagogues = Assembly places used by the Jewish people for prayer, scripture\n        reading, and community meetings. </p>\n      <p> Temple = Found in Jerusalem , this was the main worship center for\n        the Jews </p>\n      <h4>Political Groups </h4>\n      <p>Zealots = Jewish revolutionaries who wanted to throw off the rule of\n        Rome . </p>\n      <p>Jewish Under lords = &#x201C;Kings&#x201D; in Israel , like Herod, were\n        not really kings. They had some power, but were under Roman authority. </p>\n      <p>Roman prefects = Roman prefects, like Pilate, were like governors of\n        Israel </p>\n      <p>Praetorians = The Praetorian guard were high-ranking Roman soldiers\n        who guarded the Emperor and watched Paul during his house arrest. They\n        retired early and lived on large inherited plots of land in different\n        countries. </p>\n      <h4>Other Important People Groups </h4>\n      <p>Gentile = A non-Jew. </p>\n      <p>Samaritans = A people group of mixed Jewish and Gentile ancestry. Hated\n        and rejected by the Jews, they continued to worship God at a new worship\n        site at Mount Gerizim . </p>\n      <p>Tax-gatherers = Tax-gatherers, like Matthew, were Jews who defected\n        from Judaism and worked for the Romans &#x2013; collecting taxes from\n        their neighbors with the help of Roman guards. </p>\n      <p>Apostle = A commissioned messenger and overseer. </p>\n      <p>Judaisers = Some early Jewish Christians falsely taught that Christians\n        needed to be circumcised and adhere to the Jewish Law. </p>\n      <p>Gnostics = This complicated heresy began during the early-church era\n        and believed that the physical body was evil, while the spirit was good.\n        Some began beating and depriving their bodies, some began indulging in\n        any physical activity they wanted to. </p>\n      <h3>Books of the New Testament </h3>\n      <table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"590\">\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"><p>Types of Books </p></td>\n          <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"><p>Books </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"><p>Gospels &#x2013; these tell the story\n              of Jesus: His life, death, and commissioning to his followers </p></td>\n          <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"><p>Matthew, Mark, Luke, John </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"><p>Historical &#x2013; This tells the story\n              of the early Church and early missionaries </p></td>\n          <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"><p>Acts </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"><p>Epistles &#x2013; These letters were\n              written to early Churches describing spirituality </p></td>\n          <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"><p>Romans-Jude </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"><p>Apocalyptic &#x2013; This tells of the\n              future fate of the world, humankind, and Satan </p></td>\n          <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"><p>Revelations </p></td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Organic Disciplemaking","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/books/discipleship/bibleoverview.htm"}

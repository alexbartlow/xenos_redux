Dennis has personally mentored more  people into spiritual maturity and leadership than anyone I know.\"</p>\n      <p class=\"style1\">McCallum and Lowery have used personal disciplemaking to raise up scores\n        of Christian leaders. Those leaders have raised up hundreds. Speaking\n        from their 50 years of combined experience in Xenos Christian Fellowship\n        (where more than 250 home churches have been planted), the authors explain\n      in practical and biblical terms how anyone can raise up disciples. </p>\n      <p class=\"style1\">This book is intensely practical, but with solid biblical foundations\n        throughout. The authors cover eight specific areas that make up the bulk\n        of any discipling ministry: </p>\n      <ul class=\"style1\">\n        <li><strong>Friendship building</strong> - Learn how to initiate and\n          develop quality spiritual relationships as the foundation for making\n          disciples;</li>\n        <li><strong>Scripture -</strong>.

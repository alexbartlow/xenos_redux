Therefore,\n            we begin by taking what we can determine as the normal, everyday meaning\n            of the words, phrases, and sentences to the extent possible. In other\n            words, our interpretation must correspond to the words and grammar\n            in the text in a reasonable way. Otherwise, the interpreter could assign\n            his own meaning without objective control. The Bible would become a\n            horoscope of vague sayings we try to plug into our lives however we\n            want.<br>\n            <br>\n            Most of the Bible can be easily interpreted by simply taking the language\n            (either in the original or translation) in the usual way (John 3:36;\n            Acts 1:11). In other words, if the plain sense makes sense, seek no other\n            sense.<br>\n            A plain sense reading should not be confused with a literalistic interpretation.\n            We should allow for figures of speech, symbolism, and poetic language\n            (Mark 1:5; Luke 22:19). If a passage contains symbols or a special literary\n            genre (or style) this should be indicated in the text, either by textual\n            cues, or because symbolism is required in order to make sense of the\n            text. Most symbols are explained by the Bible itself (Rev. 1:9-20)</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p><strong>Interpreting historically</strong><br>\n            Historical interpretation means that we take into account the historical\n            background of the author and the recipients as much as possible. The\n            Bible was written to common people, and is understandable to anyone.\n            However, it was written thousands of years ago to a different culture.\n            Therefore, as modern readers, we have to try to recover a general sense\n            of the meaning of words, phrases and concepts in the ancient cultures.<br>\n            We are not interested at first in the question, \"What does it mean\n            to me?\" but rather, \"what did it mean to those whom it\n            was originally written?\"<br>\n            Examples:          </p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>              Rev. 2:12,13 - Pergamum was the center of the worship of Aesclepius.</li>\n            <li>              I Cor. 11:4-6 - Shorn hair was typical of Aphrodite priestesses,\n                who were also ritual prostitutes; shaven heads were typical of\n            convicted adulteresses (vs. 5).</li>\n          </ul>\n          <p>Use Bible dictionaries or other sources to discover customs,\n            money, geography, etc. Then find a corresponding meaning in our\n            culture.<br>\n            Examples:</p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>              Good Samaritan (Luke 10)</li>\n            <li>              200 Denarii (Mark 6:37)</li>\n            <li>              50,000 Drachma (Acts 19:19)</li>\n            <li>              Pharisees' teaching on the relationship between illness and sin\n            (Mark 2:5-10; John 9:1-2)</li>\n          </ul>\n        </li>\n      \n        <li>\n          <p><strong>Interpret Critically</strong><br>\n            Your interpretation must make rational sense. If interpretation is\n            permitted to contradict itself or other passages, there in no reason\n            for hermeneutics since we can make a passage say whatever we want.</p>\n        </li>\n      </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Organic Disciplemaking","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/books/discipleship/appendix4.htm"}

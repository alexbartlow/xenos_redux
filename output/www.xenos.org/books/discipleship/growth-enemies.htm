Understanding\n        how to grow is essential, but understanding the factors that erode this\n        growth is important too. </p>\n      <p><b>A. Satan </b></p>\n      <p>Satan used to be a powerful angel, until He became proud and rebelled\n        against God. He thought that He should be followed instead of God. The\n        first humans were seduced by Satan into rebellion against God. That&#x2019;s\n        the reason this world is the way it is. That is the reason for our sufferings\n        and imperfections. Humans have given Satan a place of authority in this\n        world that is very real (Col. 1:13, 21, 2 Cor. 4:4, 1 Jn. 5:19, Eph.\n        2:1-7). Once we begin a relationship with God, we cannot expect that\n        Satan will leave us alone. He will try to accuse us, divide us from others,\n        tempt us, scare us, distract us, and alienate us from God. Therefore,\n        we should: </p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>Be sober &#x2013; realize that Satan is real and may try to attack\n          in some way. This includes staying way from drunkenness and drug abuse </li>\n        <li>Forgive others, because Satan uses bitterness to penetrate Christ&#x2019;s\n          body (2 Cor. 2:11). </li>\n        <li>Pray against Satan (Eph. 6:18) </li>\n        <li>Stay in fellowship with God and others. </li>\n        <li>Learn the Bible so we can know the truth and use it to resist\n          Satan like Jesus did (Luke 4). </li>\n        <li>Stay away from occult practices or witchcraft (Deut. 18) </li>\n      </ol>\n      <p><b>B. The world system </b></p>\n      <p>The Bible teaches that we should not try to avoid the world or\n        our culture (Jn. 17:15-16, 1 Cor. 5:9-10, Phil. 2:15, Mt. 3:13-16, Jn.\n        16:33). We should be involved in our culture, and most importantly, in\n        the lives of people in our culture. However, many of the values in the\n        world stand in opposition to God, including pride and lust. (1 Jn. 2:15;\n        Jn. 12:31, Jn. 14:30, Jn. 16:11, 2 Cor. 4:4, Eph. 2:2, 1 Cor. 2:8, Eph.\n        6:12, 1 Jn. 5:19) If we want to grow spiritually, we should try to detect\n        and stand against these values (Jn. 18:36, Jn. 16:33, Jn. 12:31, Jas.\n        4:4, 1 Jn. 2:15-16, 1 Jn. 5:4). </p>\n      <p><b>C. Our sin nature </b></p>\n      <p>Just because we are no longer slaves to sin, does not mean that we will\n        not still struggle with sin. While we live in this world, we will still\n        have our sin nature inside &#x2013; a nature that hates God and loves\n        self. We can struggle against our sin nature by deciding to have faith\n        in God&#x2019;s way, and &#x201C;feeding&#x201D; our spirit with the Bible,\n        prayer, and serving love relationships. The chart below shows some of\n        the ways God has spiritually transformed us from people who are naturally\n        hateful and rebellious toward God to people who are renewed in mind,\n        will, and emotions. </p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"><p><b>The Old Mind </b></p></td>\n            <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"><p><b>The New Mind </b></p></td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"><p>1 Cor. 1:18-31, Rm. 1:18ff, Eph.\n                4:17-18, Gen. 6:5, Rm. 8:6-7, 1 Cor. 2:14, Col. 2:18, Rm. 12:3,\n                Titus 1:15, 1 Tim. 6:5, Phil. 3:19, 2 Cor. 4:4.&#xA0;&#xA0; </p>\n                <p>Darkened, empty, evil, foolish, death, at enmity with God,\n                  ignorance, blind, incapacity to receive the things of God,\n                  depraved, carnal, fleshly, conceited, defiled, corrupt, earthly. </p></td>\n            <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"><p>1 Cor. 2:7-16, 2 Cor. 5:17, Rm. 12:1-2,\n                Titus 3:5, Jn. 14:26, Jn. 16:12-15, Rm. 8:5-8, Rm. 7:23 + 25,\n                Eph. 4:23, Col. 3:5-9, Phil. 2:5, Phil. 4:8, Phil. 3:10, 1 Pet.\n                2:2, Phil. 4:6-7, 2 Tim. 1:7, 2 Cor. 10:3-5. </p>\n                <p>We have the mind of Christ, renewed, spiritually discerning,\n                  in harmony with God, spiritual, of God, renewed in knowledge,\n                  humble, true, pure, guarded by the peace of God, sound, powerful\n                  weapons. </p></td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"><p><b>The Old Heart </b></p></td>\n            <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"><p><b>The New Heart </b></p></td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"><p>2 Cor. 4:6, Ps. 14:1, Rm. 2:5, Heb.\n                3:10-12, Jas. 1:26, Rm 1:31, 2 Tim. 3:2, Jas. 4:4, 1 Jn. 2:14. </p>\n                <p>Dark, foolish, calloused and impenitent, blind, erring, evil\n                  and unbelieving, deceived, love has grown cold, enmity with\n                  God, dead.&#xA0; </p></td>\n            <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"><p>1 Cor. 2:9-11, 2 Thess. 3:5, 1 Jn.\n                4:7-21, 1 Jn. 2:9-11, 1 Thess. 4:3-7, Col. 3:2, Rm. 12:9, 1 Thess.\n                4:9-10, 1 Pet. 1:22, </p>\n                <p>knowledge of the glory of God, directed by God into the love\n                  of God, love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, loving, in\n                  the light, holiness, hidden with Christ, good, taught by God,\n                  pure, living. </p></td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"><p><b>The Old Will </b></p></td>\n            <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"><p><b>The New Will </b></p></td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"><p>Jn. 6:35-45 + 60-65, Rm. 6:14 + 16-20,\n                Gal. 5:17-21, Rm. 7:15-18 + 23, Rm. 5: 12-21, Eph. 2:2 </p>\n                <p>Enslaved by sin, death, contrary to the Spirit, captivity,\n                  death reigning, lustful, children of wrath, unwilling to come\n                  to God, no good thing, evil.&#xA0;&#xA0; </p></td>\n            <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"><p><span lang=\"IT\">Col. 3:1-15, 2 Cor.\n                  5:17, Rm. 6:12-13 + 18 + 22, Rm. 8:2, Gal. 5:1, Eph. 4:22-24,\n                  Col. 3:9-12, </span></p>\n                <p>Freedom, alive from the dead, righteous, holy, emancipated,\n                  energized, fruits of the Spirit. </p></td>\n          </tr>\n        </table>\n        </blockquote>\n      \n      \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Organic Disciplemaking","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/books/discipleship/growth-enemies.htm"}

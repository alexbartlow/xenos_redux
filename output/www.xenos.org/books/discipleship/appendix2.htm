We usually read the text and look\n          up the verses, asking for each what implications they see for the doctrine\n          of inspiration.</p>\n      <h3>Definition</h3>\n      <p><b>Inspiration</b> - &#x201C;All Scripture is inspired\n          by God [<i>theopneustos=    &#x201C;God-breathed&#x201D;</i>] and profitable\n          for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness.&#x201D; (2&#xA0;Tim.\n          3:16) - God so moved the authors of Scripture that the resulting product\n          was the Word of God written, totally without error in the autographs,\n          in every area including theology, history, geography and science.</p>\n      <h3>Reasons for Accepting This View</h3>\n      <p>An inductive case for verbal inspiration:</p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>Demonstrate the relative\n          historical reliability of the Gospel records.        </li>\n        </ol><ul>\n          <li>            <b>Bibliographical test</b> - Are there enough copies to reconstruct\n          the originals?</li>\n          <li>            <b>Internal test</b> - Does the author disqualify himself\n          by contradictions or known factual errors?</li>\n          <li><b>External test</b> - Do other historical materials confirm or\n            deny the author's testimony? (See F.F. Bruce, <i>The New Testament Documents,\n              Are They Reliable?</i> or Gleason Archer, <i>Survey of Old Testament\n                Introduction</i> for details on these questions.)</li>\n        </ul>\n        <li>Note the claims of Christ\n          to deity recorded in the Gospels.</li>\n        <li>Verify the claims deductively\n          by eliminating unsatisfactory explanations (the Lord, liar, lunatic\n          argument) or by demonstrating the authentication of Christ based on\n          biblical prophecy.</li>\n        <li>Therefore, since Christ\n          is God, his teaching on biblical inspiration is authoritative.</li>\n      \n      <h3>Christ's Teaching on Inspiration</h3>\n      <p>With your disciple, go over each of the following passages,\n        answering the question, &#x201C;What does this passage teach or imply\n        about the nature of inspiration?&#x201D;</p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>The Old Testament:<br>\n          Mat. 5:18; John 10:35; John 5:39-47; Mark 12:36; Mat. 19:4-5; Mat. 22:29-32;\n          Mat. 12:39,40; Luke 17:26-32; Luke 24:44 </li>\n        <li>His own words:<br>\n          Mat. 24:35; Mat. 7:24-27; John 3:5 \"truly I say\"; John 8:31,\n          32</li>\n        <li>The Apostles' writings:<br>\n          Jesus preauthenticated the apostles' writings during the last\n          supper: John 14:26; John 15:26,27; John 16:13,14</li>\n      </ol>\n      <h3>The Human Authors Agree with Christ's Position</h3>\n      <p>Again, if you have your disciples read these passages with you,\n        and determine what each teaches or implies about inspiration, the knowledge\n        will last longer in their memory than simply telling them.</p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>The Old Testament:<br>\n          Joshua 1:8; 22:5; 2 Sam. 23:2; Neh. 10:29</li>\n        <li>The New Testament:<br>\n          John 21:24; 1&#xA0;Cor. 14:37; Gal. 1:11-12; 1&#xA0;Thess. 2:13; 1 Tim.\n          5:18 (Where in the scripture does it say &#x201C;The laborer is worthy&#x2026;?&#x201D;)\n          2&#xA0;Tim. 3:16; 2&#xA0;Pet. 1:16-21; 2&#xA0;Pet. 3:2; 2&#xA0;Pet.\n          3:15, 16; Rev. 1:3; Rev. 22:18,19</li>\n      </ol>\n      \n      \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Organic Disciplemaking","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/books/discipleship/appendix2.htm"}

While we can never fully understand the infinite God, he has\n        revealed important points about his character. Understanding the character\n        of God is important. These features of God, or attributes of God, are\n        all eternal and coequal. We should never stress one attribute of God\n        at the expense of another. Anything we say about God should not contradict\n        any of these attributes. You can study each attribute and read the verses,\n        considering how theologians get these attributes from the passages listed.\n        Then ask how each particular attribute might apply to daily Christian\n        living. Think how an attribute of God might affect your prayer life,\n        your ministry, your attitudes toward him, etc.</p>\n      <p>1.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; God is <i>omniscient.</i> That\n        means he knows all things actual or possible at once. This includes the\n        past and the future (Ps. 147:5; Is. 40:28).</p>\n      <p>2.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; God is <i>omnipresent.</i> This\n        means God transcends all limits of space. He can be everywhere at once\n        (Ps. 139:7-10).</p>\n      <p>3.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; God is <i>omnipotent.</i> That\n        means he can do whatever he wants. God's power is unbounded except\n        by his own nature (Gen. 18:14; 2&#xA0;Tim. 2:13).</p>\n      <p>4.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; God is <i>sovereign</i>. This\n        means he owns the creation and rules it, and all of his creatures depend\n        on him. Sovereignty doesn't have to mean God directly causes everything,\n        but nothing can happen without him permitting it. (Ps. 14:1; Gen. 14:19;\n        Acts 7:24-28)</p>\n      <p>5.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; God is <i>loving</i> or <i>gracious</i>.\n        He treats his creation with love and an attitude of mercy (1 John 4:8,16;\n        Isaiah 30:18-21;49:14-16).</p>\n      <p>6.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; God is <i>righteous</i>. God's\n        moral character is the definition of goodness (Mark 10:18; Job 34:10;\n        Hab. 1:13; James 1:13).</p>\n      <p>7.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; God is <i>immutable</i>, or <i>unchanging</i>.\n        He is devoid of change with regard to His attributes or promises. Note\n        that this doesn't imply that God never does or says anything different.\n        Only his attributes and promises are unchanging (Heb. 13:8; James 1:17;\n        1 Sam. 15:29).</p>\n      <p>8.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; God is <i>truthful</i> and <i>reliable</i>.\n        He tells the truth and cannot lie. He is also faithful (Heb. 6:18; Num.\n        23:19; Titus 1:2; 2 Tim 2:13).</p>\n      <p>9.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; God is <i>infinite</i>. This\n        means both that he had no beginning, and he is free from all limitations.\n        It also means he holds all his attributes to an infinite degree (Ps.\n        90:2; Jude 1:25; Isaiah 44:6; Rev. 1:8).</p>\n      <p>10.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; God is <i>self-existent</i>, or <i>independent</i>.\n        The ground of God's existence is himself. He is uncaused and exists\n        by necessity of his own being. (See divine name YHWH which means &#x201C;I\n        am.&#x201D;) This attribute also means God does not need his creation.\n        He meets all his own needs (Ex. 3:14; John 8:58; Isaiah 40:28; Acts\n        17:25).</p>\n      <p>11.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; God is <i>just</i> or <i>fair</i>. God cannot\n        ignore evil. He must repay evil or good fairly (Rom. 2:1-5; Gen. 18:25;\n        Ps. 19:9.</p>\n      \n      \n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    </td>\n  </div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Organic Disciplemaking","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/books/discipleship/appendix6.htm"}

We refer to ourselves \n        in the third person in order to keep the focus on the text. The guide \n        is arranged for use in any one of four venues: \n      </p><ul>\n        <li>Individual enrichment </li>\n        <li>Couples premarital study </li>\n        <li>Married couples' enrichment </li>\n        <li>Group study </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>We have seen excellent results using this book as a basis for small group \n        as well as in premarital counseling. If using <i>Spiritual Relationships \n        That Last</i> as a premarital or marital counseling aid, you may want \n        to read the chapter together before going over the questions. For group \n        leaders, the facilitator's guide provides suggested answers or tips to \n        key questions. The other three venues will have no use for the facilitator's \n        guide. </p>\n      <p>Hundreds of couples planning their marriage have reported this study \n        brought to light issues God wanted to call to their attention. May God \n        use the material to richly bless your present or future marriage as well \n        as the other relationships in your life.</p>\n      <h3>How to lead a group study based on this book:</h3>\n      <p>First read the chapter from the book. Then come to this guide to deepen \n        and apply the principles you learn in the book. You can obtain copies \n        of <i>Spiritual Relationships That Last</i> for each member of the group \n        either at your bookstore, or you get quantity pricing from the Xenos <a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/cgi-bin/shopper.exe?preadd=action&amp;key=b006\">webstore</a>. \n        Also, get both this facilitator's guide and the discussion guide. Copy \n        the pages from the discussion guide and pass them out, preferably a week \n        before the discussion on a given chapter. The facilitator may need to \n        select which questions to cover on a given chapter because covering all \n        questions may take too long. </p>\n      <p>You can download for free either the leader's version or the group member \n        or counselee version (missing suggested answers) from the Web site mentioned \n        above, or call 800-698-7884 and request they be sent to your address. \n        Hard copies are not free like soft copies, because paper, reproduction, \n        mailing, and handling all cost.

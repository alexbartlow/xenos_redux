If we want our\nculture to take the message of the gospel seriously, we need to demonstrate Christ's\nunique love in their relationships with one another. (John 13:34,35; 17:21,23) But\nChristian relationships often betray conformity to this culture rather than expressing the\ntransforming power of Christ. Christians therefore need a scriptural and practical picture\nof the kind of love relationships Jesus envisioned as the context for communicating his\nlife-giving message. </p>\n\n<p>But what does this kind of relationship look like? <i>Loving God's Way </i>answers this\nquestion by studying the main \"one another\" imperatives in the New Testament\nepistles. These imperatives are the apostles' own explanation and application of Jesus'\ncommand to \"love one another as I have loved you.\" Taken together, they provide\nyou with a practical and balanced understanding of Christian love. This book does not\nrequire sophisticated theological understanding on the reader's part. It explains\ntheological vocabulary and concepts with an emphasis on practical application. </p>\n\n<p>You will benefit most from being able to survey all of the main \"one another\"\nimperatives in one volume. A complementary, balanced understanding of biblical love\nrelationships emerges from this approach. For example, the importance of encouraging one\nanother is paired with the importance of admonition. The importance of confessing our sins\nto one another is tempered by the necessity of forgiving those who have sinned against us.\nBy studying these \"one another\" imperatives and the biblical principles related\nto them, you will be introduced in a practical way to a lifestyle of Christian love. </p>\n\n<p><i>Loving God's Way</i> was published by Kregel in early 1996. Look for it at your\nChristian bookstore, or order it at a discount directly from us. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/cgi-bin/shopper.exe?preadd=action&amp;key=b007\">Order a copy</a> of <em>Loving\nGod's Way</em>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.xenos.org/index.htm\">Return to Xenos Home Page</a>  \n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n</p>\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</div>","date_published":null,"dek":null,"lead_image_url":null,"title":"Loving God's Way","rendered_pages":1,"path":"www.xenos.org/books/lgw.htm"}

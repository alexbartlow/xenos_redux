<h1>The Objectification Of Religion:<br>
Universal Themes VI</h1>

<h5>By <a href="../personal/den.htm">Dennis McCallum</a></h5>

<hr>

<h3>Endnotes:</h3>

<p>1 Edward Norbeck, <i>Religion in Primitive Society</i>, (Harper &amp; Row, Publishers,
New York, NY. 1961)p. 71 Although this book does, as its title suggests, focus on oral
cultures' religions, it also contains extensive sections on other religions as well. </p>

<p>2 Edward Norbeck, <i>Religion in Primitive Society</i>, p.71 </p>

<p>3 Geoffrey Parrinder, <i>Worship in the World's Religions</i>, (Association Press, New
York, NY. 1961)p. 18 </p>

<p>4 Parrinder documents some of these errors, including the famous error made by Darwin
in Teirra del Fuego in 1883. He asserted that the natives there were at a pre-religious
state, and this was widely believed for decades, but later proved false. Geoffrey
Parrinder, <i>Worship in the World's Religions</i>, p. 20 </p>

<p>5 Parrinder, Geoffrey. <i>Worship in the World's Religions</i>, p. 19 Of course, the
present author is a theologian. In addition, Parrinder himself does not shrink back from
discerning patterns that run across all religions. </p>

<p>6 Norbeck, Edward. <i>Religion in Primitive Society</i>, p. 267,268 </p>

<p>7 Carmody Denise L. and Carmody, John T., <i>Ways To The Center Second Edition</i>,
(Wadsworth Publishing Co. Belmont CA. 1984) p. </p>

<p>8 Without, however, ignoring other areas entirely. </p>

<p>9 Edward Norbeck, <i>Religion in Primitive Society</i>, p. 72 Norbeck also
adds,&quot;It is doubtful that any body of philosophical or ethical principles could
survive unless it involved...unity among its members brought about by joint acts, in
short, a church-like organization and ritual of some kind in which adherents
participate.&quot; p.71 </p>

<p>10 Douglas Davies, &quot;Myths and Symbols&quot;, in <i>Eerdman's Handbook to World
Religions</i>, (Grand Rapids, MI.: William Eerdman Publishing Company, 1982,) p. 36. </p>

<p>11 Edward Norbeck, <i>Religion in Primitive Society</i>, &quot;Whether himself a
performer of the ritual or an onlooker, the individual may participate by seeing and
hearing and through the vicarious experiences evoked.&quot; p. 73 </p>

<p>12 Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism, and Confucianism are examples of religious
traditions that began with few or no external forms. </p>

<p>13 Edward Norbeck, <i>Religion in Primitive Society</i>, p. 72 The paper is often
placed on an altar and petitions are addressed in that direction. Of course, Islam has no
problem with sacred space, or with sacred time. </p>

<p>14 John 4:21-24. All quotations from <i>The New American Standard Bible</i>, (Lockman
Foundation, 1963) It is also noticeable from a historical point of view as Norbeck points
out, &quot;Early Christianity involved no objectification by means of paintings and
statuary...&quot; Yet this was changed radically before long. Edward Norbeck, <i>Religion
in Primitive Society</i>, p. 72 </p>

<p>15 Anthony F. C. Wallis, &quot;Rituals: Sacred and Profane--An Anthropological
Approach&quot;, from Religion: An Anthropological View, (Random House, Inc. 1966)
reprinted in <i>Ways of Being Religious, Readings For a New Approach to Religion</i>,
Allen, Jay T., Lloyd, Charles L. Jr., Streng, Frederick J. (Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey:
Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1973). p. 157. </p>

<p>19 Harold Turner, &quot;Holy Places, Sacred Calendars&quot;, in <i>Eerdman's Handbook

<p>20 Mircea Eliade, <i>Patterns in Comparative Religion</i>. p. 370 </p>

<p>21 Sir James George Frazer, <i>The Golden Bough</i>, (New York, NY.: Macmillan Company,
1940) p. 56. </p>

<p>22 Alfred C. Haddon, <i>Magic and Fetishism</i>, (Constable &amp; Company Ltd.
Leicester Square, W.C. 1921) p. 92 </p>

<p>23 Alfred C. Haddon, <i>Magic and Fetishism</i>, p. 77 He also says, &quot;Animism sees
all things animated by spirits; fetishism sees a spirit incorporated in an individual
object.&quot; p. 77 &quot;The material objects which form the tutelary deities or Boshun
of the natives of the Gold Coast are not symbols of gods which usually reside elsewhere;
each is the actual receptacle or ordinary abiding-place of an indwelling god.&quot; p. 78
He explains that these containers are prayed to, sacrificed to, and venerated like any
other deity. </p>

<p>24 Eliade, Mircea. <i>Patterns in Comparative Religion</i>. p. 369 </p>

<p>25 Sir James George Frazer, <i>The Golden Bough</i>, (New York, NY.: Macmillan Company,
1940) p. 56 </p>

<p>26 Geoffrey Parrinder, <i>Worship in the World's Religions</i>, p. 27 We would have to
side with Parrinder here against Frazer. The argument referred to runs thus, &quot;But if
in the most backward state of human society now known to us we find magic thus
conspicuously present and religion conspicuously absent, may we not reasonably conjecture
that the civilized races of the world have also at some period of their history passed
through a similar intellectual phase, that they attempted to force the great powers of
nature to do their pleasure before they thought of courting their favor by offerings and
prayer--in short that, just as on the material side of human culture there has everywhere
been an Age of Stone, so on the intellectual side there has everywhere been an Age of
Magic?&quot; Sir James George Frazer, <i>The Golden Bough</i>, (New York, NY.: Macmillan
Company, 1940) p.55 </p>

<p>This argument, cited here in full because it is typical of the attitude of many
scholars, is based on conjecture and misinformation. There is never an absence of religion
in &quot;primitive&quot; societies, nor is there an absence of magic in the so-called
&quot;civilized races of the world&quot;, as this paper hopefully shows. </p>

<p>27 Alfred C. Haddon, <i>Magic and Fetishism</i>, p. 79 This description fits most
priestly mystical practices in well developed objectified religion. Haddon further states,
&quot;...the conception of the fetish as the vehicle of communication between spirit and
worshiper raises fetishism to a higher plane in religious evolution...&quot; p. 80 And
again, &quot;...(fetishism) includes conceptions which persist into higher forms of
religion, such as the worship of the symbol of an unseen power.&quot; p. 92 Here we see an
example of language that is somewhat outdated, although the content of the statement is
true. </p>

<p>28 Harold Turner, &quot;Holy Places, Sacred Calendars&quot;, in <i>Eerdman's Handbook
to World Religions</i>, (Grand Rapids, MI.: William Eerdman Publishing Company, 1982,)
Turner is typical of many when he says, &quot;Since divine power is more accessible at
sanctuaries, these become places of pilgrimage.&quot; Here is the &quot;vehicle&quot;
notion to be sure. However, he then feels it necessary to add, &quot;The synagogues,
churches and mosques of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, however, should be seen as
meeting-places for the worshipers, not as sacred dwelling-places for God.&quot; p.20 This
distinction seems unwarranted. Why is it necessary to remove one's shoes before entering a
mosque? Why are children not permitted to run in the &quot;sanctuary&quot;? Why may we
smoke in the parking lot, but not in the sanctuary? What does the term Sanctuary mean? </p>

<p>Carmody and Carmody have a more accurate view when they say, &quot;A mosque, a
synagogue, and a church all show likenesses of a Hindu or a Buddhist temple. All five
enclose sacred space.&quot; Denise L. Carmody and John T. Carmody, <i>Ways To The Center
Second Edition</i>, p. 352 </p>

<p>29 Edward Norbeck, <i>Religion in Primitive Society</i>, p. 82 </p>

<p>30 This is the interpretation favored by Wallis for many objectified aspects of
religion. For instance &quot;...the simple ritual act of crossing oneself, in Catholic
custom, by touching the fingers to the forehead and chest in four, must be understood as a
statement of intent to secure divine power as a protection against danger, spiritual or
physical. The &quot;sign of the cross&quot;, the extremities of which are indicated by the
points touched, invokes the whole story of Christ and its complex meanings; the
accompanying litany--&quot;In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
Amen&quot;--...constitutes both a prayer and a primitive magical conception of power
inherent in naming; Thus, this simple act may be a statement ...of beliefs based both on
ancient Christian mythology and even more ancient conceptions of magic.&quot; Anthony F.
C. Wallis, &quot;Rituals: Sacred and Profane--An Anthropological Approach&quot;, in <i>Ways
of Being Religious Readings For a New Approach to Religion</i>, p. 156 </p>

<p>31 Haddon, Alfred C. <i>Magic and Fetishism</i>, p.9432 Geoffrey Parrinder, <i>Worship
in the World's Religions</i>, p. 28. He acknowledges that there are some temples among
non-literate peoples, but points out that they are small, and often not built of lasting
material. </p>

<p>34 Edward Norbeck, <i>Religion in Primitive Society</i>, p. 56 </p>

<p>35 Robert Brow, &quot;Origins of Religion&quot;, in <i>Eerdman's Handbook to World
Religions</i>, (Grand Rapids, MI.: William Eerdman Publishing Company, 1982,) p. 31 For a
good defense of this theory on the popular level, see Don Richardson, <i>Eternity in Their
Hearts</i>, (Ventura CA: Regal Books, 1981) </p>

<p>36 Robert Brow, &quot;Origins of Religion&quot;, in <i>Eerdman's Handbook to World
Religions</i>, &quot;The essence of priestcraft is the rise of a group of people who claim
to control access to God, and who suggest that the offering of sacrifice is a meritorious
act which forces God to grant favors&quot;. p. 38 Brow cites the case of India, &quot;The
Brahmins were suggesting that by the right sacrifices, which they could alone offer, they
could procure the favors of the gods, various temporal blessings, and a good place in
heaven. Gods, men, governments, all were under priestly control.&quot; p. 38 </p>

<p>37 Robert Brow, &quot;Origins of Religion&quot;, in <i>Eerdman's Handbook to World
Religions</i>, (Grand Rapids, MI.: William Eerdman Publishing Company, 1982,) &quot;This
shows how easily priestcraft degenerates into magic. Once sacrifice becomes a meritorious
act which forces God to give blessings, it can be used to obtain benefits for oneself and
harm for one's enemies. Obviously we are now only one stage removed from the medicine
man...&quot; p. 38 </p>

<p>38 Sir E.A. Wallis Budge, <i>Amulets and Talismans</i>, (University Books, 1961, New
Hyde Park, NY) p. xvi. </p>

<p>39 Sir E.A. Wallis Budge, <i>Amulets and Talismans</i>, &quot;...from early Christian
times the Cross has been regarded as the amulet and talisman par excellence throughout
Ethiopia.&quot;p.xxii, </p>

<p>and again,&quot;...civilized priests of Egypt, Sumer and Babylonia... did not reject
the crude magical beliefs and practices of their predecessors...on the contrary they
adopted many of them unaltered, and they formed an integral part of the mystery of the
religion which they formulated. Henceforth magic and religion went hand in hand. The gods
became magicians, and employed magic when necessary, and dispensed it through their
priests to mankind.&quot; p.xvi </p>

<p>and finally, &quot;...in Babylonia, Assyria and Egypt amulets were designed and made by
workmen attached to the great temples, and the inscriptions on them were drafted by the
priests and engraved by employees in the temples.&quot; p.xxiv </p>

<p>40 Sir E.A. Wallis Budge, <i>Amulets and Talismans</i>, &quot;Shortly after the close
of the IVth century of our Era, a sort of revival in the use of amulets began and the
Christians began to make use of amulets...by the clergy and laity alike to drive away
devils and disease-producing spirits. (the cross)...Then came pictures of the Virgin Mary,
and pictures and figures of the Archangels and the great saints, and the cult of the
relics of the martyrs... Untanned leather and parchment and papyrus and stones were also
inscribed with extracts from the Scriptures, and finally, after the invention of paper, <i>Amulets
and Talismans</i> of paper became common. And a species of Christian Magic came into
being. The greatest name and word of power was Jesus, and the Host and sacramental oil and
incense became, to many, amulets of invincible power, and the Sacred Elements were
actually called &quot;immortal medicine&quot;.&quot; p. xxviii </p>

<p>41 Robert Brow, &quot;Origins of Religion&quot;, in <i>Eerdman's Handbook to World
Religions</i>, p. 38 and p. </p>

<p>42 His chronology is open to debate in my view, although the major point is correct. </p>

<p>42 Anthony F. C. Wallis, &quot;Rituals: Sacred and Profane--An Anthropological
Approach&quot;, in <i>Ways of Being Religious Readings For a New Approach to Religion</i>,
Wallis also applies these steps to &quot;secular&quot; ritual. </p>

Approach&quot;, in <i>Ways of Being Religious Readings For a New Approach to Religion</i>,

<p>45 Anthony F. C. Wallis, &quot;Rituals: Sacred and Profane--An Anthropological
Approach&quot;, in <i>Ways of Being Religious Readings For a New Approach to Religion</i>,
p. 159 </p>

<p>46 Wallis affirms that &quot;The ritual process, as described above, is a universal
human phenomenon...&quot; and, &quot;One- but only one- way of institutionalizing the
ritual process is to interpret and apply it within the context of a belief in supernatural
beings.&quot; Anthony F. C. Wallis, &quot;Rituals: Sacred and Profane--An Anthropological
Approach&quot;, in <i>Ways of Being Religious Readings For a New Approach to Religion</i>,
p. 160 </p>

<p>47 Paul did so frequently, but most clearly in I Cor. 3:16 (note plural
&quot;humas&quot;), Christ did so in John 2:19-21, Peter in I Pet.2:5. </p>

<p>48 Heb. 8:13; 13:10-14; Acts 7:48-50 etc. </p>

<p>49 Col.2:16-17 directly declares the idea of a sacred calendar to be obsolete. Gal.
4:9,10 says that a sacred calendar is among the &quot;weak and worthless elemental
things.&quot; Even though Paul allows &quot;weaker brethren&quot; to observe &quot;one day
greater than another&quot;, it is clear that he views this outlook as unnecessary. (Rom.
14) </p>

<p>50 Hebrews chapters 5 through 8 decisively limits the intercession of the high Priestly
role to Christ, as does I Tim. 2:5. At the same time, Peter refers to all believers as
&quot;a nation of priests&quot; in I Pet. 2:5, because we are able to intercede for
others. </p>

<p>51 It could be argued that the anointing with oil mentioned in James 5:14 and the
laying on of hands practiced in Acts were elements of objectification also (Acts 13:3; I
Tim. 4:14; II Tim. 1:6; I Tim. 5:22). However, I think these were cultural features that
were not directly related to the worship of God-- that is, they deal with ways believers
relate to each other rather than to God. </p>

strong here. </p>

<p>61 Objectified religion is often just as mechanistic as I am suggesting, as can be seen
from the following observation, &quot;Many of the important reforms of Nicon, for example,
are small matters of ritual performance, of which perhaps the most important in arousing
contention was the question of the number of fingers to be used in making the sign of the
cross.&quot; Edward Norbeck, <i>Religion in Primitive Society</i>, p. 74. </p>

<p>62 We cannot, in my view, rule out the idea that the possession phenomena mentioned by
Wallis could involve real spiritual contact of some sort. </p>

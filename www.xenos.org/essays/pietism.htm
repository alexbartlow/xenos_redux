<h1 align="CENTER">Early German Lutheran Pietism's<br>
Understanding of Justification</h1>

<hr align="LEFT">

<p>by <a href="../personal/gary.htm?subject=lutheran%20pietism's">Gary DeLashmutt</a></p>
<font face="Arial">

<p>Introduction</p>
</font>

<p>The purpose of this research project is to examine the early German Lutheran Pietists'
understanding of justification. Specifically, the teaching of Johann Arndt, Philip Jacob
Spener and August Hermann Francke will be studied. Three specific areas of their view of
justification will be examined: the basis of justification, the relationship between
justification and sanctification, and the role of baptism in justification. </p>

<p>An effort has been made to identify and study the primary sources of each of the above
Pietists in these doctrinal areas. Direct quotation of their works accompany and
substantiate any assertion concerning their teaching. Secondary sources have also been
evaluated for additional interaction in the interpretation of the primary sources.</p>

<p>Consideration has also been given to the theological and political climate of
Protestantism during the seventeenth century. This has been done in order to assure
fairness in evaluating the doctrinal emphases of the Pietists. </p>
<font face="Arial">

<p>The Background of German Pietism</p>
</font>

<p>Like all religious movements, German Pietism was, at least in part, a reaction to the
spiritual and political climate of its day. Any attempt to understand the theological
emphases of Arndt, Spener and Francke must therefore be preceded by an overview of the
religious and political climate in which they lived.</p>
<b>

<p align="CENTER">The Religious Situation</p>
</b>

<p>The most important factor in German Lutheranism just prior to the emergence of Pietism
was its rigid confessionalism, or <i>Verkonfessionalisierung</i>.</p>

<p>After Luther died in 1546, Lutheran scholars tried to precisely formulate the doctrines
of the Christian faith as they understood them. This was felt to be necessary since the
Lutherans were experiencing acute doctrinal pressure from both aggressive Calvinists and
Jesuit Catholics.<a href="#Footnote1B"></a><a name="Footnote1A">Footnote1</a> Two camps
developed within Lutheranism: the &quot;Philippists&quot;, who, following the example of
Luther's mentor Philip Melanchthon, emphasized the common doctrinal ground that they
shared with the Calvinists, and the &quot;Gnesio-Lutherans&quot;, who held rigidly to
Luther's main tenets and regarded all other groups with suspicion. It was the
Gnesio-Lutherans who won out in this struggle for ascendancy.<a href="#Footnote2B"></a><a name="Footnote2A">Footnote2</a> The Formula of Concord of 1580 formally resolved the
doctrinal disputes within Lutheranism.<a href="#Footnote3B"></a><a name="Footnote3A">Footnote3</a></p>

<p>With its center at the University of Wittenberg<a href="#Footnote4B"></a><a name="Footnote4A">Footnote4</a>, the same school from which Luther launched the
Reformation, Lutheranism lapsed into a rigid orthodoxy and sterile scholasticism.
Ironically, though Luther had unseated Thomist scholasticism from its throne of power over
theology, the Lutheran scholars of this period consciously reintroduced it in order to
formulate their doctrinal statements.<a href="#Footnote5B"></a><a name="Footnote5A">Footnote5</a>
The University of Wittenberg declared that the resulting creedal formulations of
Lutheranism &quot;possessed the force of divinely revealed and binding truth, not only in
matters of doctrine, but in all affairs.&quot;<a href="#Footnote6B"></a><a name="Footnote6A">Footnote6</a></p>

<p>This defensive, heavily dogmatic emphasis produced Lutheran Confessionalism--a dead
orthodoxy that Luther would hardly have desired. Stoeffler describes this confessionalism
and its effects on how people came to view Christianity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It (<i>Verkonfessionalisierung</i>) refers to the rigid confessionalizing of
  Lutheranism which was undertaken by its seventeenth century theologians. The process was
  aided by the reappearance of Aristotelianism in German universities and gymnasia early
  during that century. The result was an unprecedented hardening of Lutheran doctrine. Not
  only did the guardians of orthodoxy endeavor to keep pure the teachings of the communion
  but the truth had to be stated in accepted phrases. Any deviation in phraseology was
  immediately viewed with great suspicion. After John Gerhard the various minutiae of the
  seventeenth century systems of Lutheran theology had to be treated in proper order and
  sequence so as not to raise apprehensions of heresy. In this heavily dogmatic atmosphere
  the essence of Christianity came to be regarded as consisting in a series of rationally
  ordered propositions. Faith had been largely re-defined so as to consist in personal
  assent to those propositions. Confessional theology and Christianity were regarded as
  almost synonymous.<a href="#Footnote7B"></a><a name="Footnote7A">Footnote7</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brown is similarly critical in his evaluation of Lutheran Confessionalism, viewing it
as a virtual reversal of the Reformation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Negatively, some have felt that in Protestant Scholasticism we have an
  &quot;intellectual Pelegianism&quot; in which the good works of the medieval church were
  exchanged for the works of understanding. Aristotle, who had been thrown out the front
  door, quickly came in the back. Justification by faith became one of the dogmas instead of
  the source of dogma. Luther's God, who was a Thou, became an It. The testimony of the Holy
  Spirit became a mere intellectual process of increasing acquaintance with the truth.
  Though there was an apotheosis of the Bible, the Scriptures were used primarily as proof
  texts to verify the creedal dogmas.<a href="#Footnote8B"></a><a name="Footnote8A">Footnote8</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spener, writing in <i>Pia Desideria</i>, similarly complained about the scholasticism
of Lutheran Confessionalism:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although by God's grace we still have pure doctrine derived from the Word of God, we
  cannot deny that much that is alien, useless, and reminiscent of the world's wisdom has
  here and there been gradually introduced into theology.<a href="#Footnote9B"></a><a name="Footnote9A">Footnote9</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since the pastors were being educated in this spiritual climate, it is not surprising
that their preaching consisted mainly of dogmatic expositions of Lutheran doctrine and
polemical denunciations of Catholicism and Calvinism, rather than applied scripture which
would build up the spiritual life of their congregations.<a href="#Footnote10B"></a><a name="Footnote10A">Footnote10</a></p>
<b>

<p align="CENTER">The Political Situation</p>
</b>

<p>The spiritual unhealthy of late sixteenth century Germany was further aggravated by the
political situation. Two factors in the political situation helped stir the spiritual
hunger of the people who responded to the Pietists' message.</p>
<font face="Arial">

<p>The Thirty Years War</p>
</font>

<p>The Thirty Years War lasted from 1609 until 1637, although the Peace of Westphalia
which formally ended the war was not signed until 1648.<a href="#Footnote11B"></a><a name="Footnote11A">Footnote11</a> This war, fought largely because of the religious
intolerance between Catholic and Protestant rulers, devastated Europe worse than any other
war before the twentieth century. </p>

<p>The war ended without any genuine resolution. The rulers simply wearied of the
bloodshed and economic loss caused by it. The Peace of Westphalia granted to both rulers
and subjects &quot;freedom of religion&quot;--as long as they were Catholic, Lutheran or
Reformed. Although this increased religious tolerance was an improvement, it was not
promulgated by the political rulers &quot;out of a deeper understanding of Christian love,
but rather out of a growing indifference to religious matters.&quot;<a href="#Footnote12B"></a><a name="Footnote12A">Footnote12</a></p>

<p>This same indifference spread to the common people, whose lives were devastated by the
war. The war had the effect of weakening the people's moral fiber. Cruelty and drunkenness
became commonplace among the peasants. Their spiritual malaise was further aggravated by
the ruthless and uninhibited behavior of both rulers and soldiers.<a href="#Footnote13B"></a><a name="Footnote13A">Footnote13</a> &quot;The seemingly interminable war raised religious
doubts among the laity and generated indifference to moral and spiritual matters.&quot;<a href="#Footnote14B"></a><a name="Footnote14A">Footnote14</a></p>
<font face="Arial">

<p>The German State-Church Relationship</p>
</font>

<p>For a variety of reasons which lie outside the scope of this project, Luther did not
sever the state's control over the church at the time of the Reformation. This wedding of
church and state had a damaging effect on the spiritual health of German Lutherans for two
reasons.</p>

<p>First, with the church and state under common jurisdiction, the church's power to
exercise discipline with its members was limited by the agreement of the state rulers. As
Stoeffler says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Under the circumstances no presbyterial element had an opportunity to develop within
  Lutheranism. In most instances the churches and clergy were at the mercy of territorial
  rulers, the latter being often dissolute and seldom devout. Even if Lutheranism had
  developed a concept of church discipline, which it did not, effective discipline would
  have been difficult under these conditions.<a href="#Footnote15B"></a><a name="Footnote15A">Footnote15</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since church discipline is one of the means Christ provided to maintain the church's
spiritual vitality<a href="#Footnote16B"></a><a name="Footnote16A">Footnote16</a>, its
absence from German Lutheranism left the church much more vulnerable to spiritual decay.</p>

<p>A state-run church tends to lower the collective spirituality of the church in another
way. Since everyone is supposedly a Christian in a state which is &quot;Christian,&quot;
the society does not tend to rise to the ethical or spiritual quality of the church.
Rather, the church tends to conform to the society. This was certainly the case in
seventeenth century Germany.<a href="#Footnote17B"></a><a name="Footnote17A">Footnote17</a></p>
<b>

<p align="CENTER">The Resultant Nominalism</p>
</b>

<p>The factors described above combined in German Lutheranism in the seventeenth century
to produce a form of Christianity which was nominal both in practice and in doctrine. </p>

<p>Confessional Lutheranism was doctrinally nominal because it defined being a Christian
almost exclusively in terms of mental affirmation of Lutheran dogma.<a href="#Footnote18B"></a><a name="Footnote18A">Footnote18</a> Nicolaus Amsdorf, a theologian of this period, even went
so far as to teach that good works were hurtful to the Christian life since they could
foster a doctrine of justification by works!<a href="#Footnote19B"></a><a name="Footnote19A">Footnote19</a> Stoeffler describes this doctrinal nominalism:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When their rigidly objective interpretation of justification was joined to an equally
  objective interpretation of baptismal regeneration the centrality of the saving
  relationship was rather effectively eliminated from seventeenth century Lutheran
  orthodoxy. The Christian was now thought to be a person who interprets the Bible in terms
  of the Lutheran symbols as the truth of these symbols is expressed in an orthodox system
  of theology. <cite>Fiducia</cite> had become <cite>assensus</cite>, the liberty of the
  Christian man had given way to the tyranny of scholastic theology, and the Bible had once
  again become an arsenal of proof texts.<a href="#Footnote20B"></a><a name="Footnote20A">Footnote20</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This gross distortion of the theology of Paul and (to a lesser extent) Luther had the
predictable effect of producing a behavioral nominalism that was worse than that of other
post-Reformation Protestant churches. The laity had little appreciation of Christianity as
a way of life as well as a series of doctrinal beliefs.<a href="#Footnote21B"></a><a name="Footnote21A">Footnote21</a> Though the churches were well attended, there was little
evidence of ethical transformation which was encouraged and manifested in the New
Testament church. Personal spiritual devotion was replaced by superficial and mechanical
religious observance<a href="#Footnote22B"></a><a name="Footnote22A">Footnote22</a> which
God, speaking through the Old Testament prophets, says He hates.<a href="#Footnote23B"></a><a name="Footnote23A">Footnote23</a> In Arndt, Spener and Francke, a similar prophetic voice
was sounded.</p>
<font face="Arial">

<p>Early Lutheran Pietis<cite>ts</p>
</cite></font>

<p>Johann Arndt (1555-1621) has been widely acknowledged as the theological father of
German Lutheran Pietism.<a href="#Footnote24B"></a><a name="Footnote24A">Footnote24</a> As
a Lutheran pastor and a scholar of Luther's writings, his <i>True Christianity</i> (1605)
was the first German Pietist work to challenge the spiritual maladies of Lutheran
orthodoxy.</p>

<p>Philip Jacob Spener (1635-1705) is credited with forging the ideas of Arndt into a
reform movement within Lutheranism.<a href="#Footnote25B"></a><a name="Footnote25A">Footnote25</a>
Like Arndt, he was a Lutheran pastor and scholar. He was deeply influenced by <i>True
Christianity</i>, and in 1675, he wrote a foreword to a new edition of <i>True
Christianity</i>. This foreword, reissued separately a year later, was entitled <i>Pia
Desideria, or Heartfelt Desire for a God-pleasing Reform of the True Evangelical Church,
Together with Several Simple Christian Proposals Looking Toward this End</i>. As the title
suggests, this work not only critiqued the spiritual state of German Lutheranism; it also
outlined a plan of reform. It was greeted with an enthusiastic response by many German
people, but with sharp criticism by much of the the clergy. In his subsequent works,
Spener continued to outline the needed reform of the Lutheran church.</p>

<p>August Hermann Francke (1663-1727) was Spener's disciple and friend. As a Lutheran
pastor, he found himself in conflict with other Lutheran clergymen after undergoing a
profound conversion experience. As a result of Spener's influence, Francke was invited to
become professor of Greek and Oriental languages at the newly formed University of Halle.
Under his leadership, Halle became a key means of Pietist reform as it trained men for the
Lutheran pastorate who were taught the theology and practice of Arndt, Spener and Francke.<a href="#Footnote26B"></a><a name="Footnote26A">Footnote26</a></p>
<font face="Arial">

<p>The Basis of Justification</p>
</font>

<p>The critical rediscovery of Luther and the Reformers was the doctrine of justification
by grace through faith alone. God legally cancels the debt of our sins and imputes
Christ's righteousness to us when we place our faith in Christ and His work on the cross
to make us acceptable to God. Arndt, Spener and Francke completely agreed with this
doctrine. Their impact was the result not of a different view of justification, but of a
different definition of the faith that effects justification.</p>
<b>

<p align="CENTER">Justification by Faith Alone</p>
</b>

<p>Many Lutheran Confessionalists accused Arndt, Spener and Francke of teaching
justification by works, or of confusing justification with sanctification.<a href="#Footnote27B"></a><a name="Footnote27A">Footnote27</a> However, an examination of
their writings proves that all three men believed that justification is by grace through
faith alone, and that justification must precede sanctification.</p>

<p>Because Arndt was aware of the accusations leveled at him, he went out of his way to
state his Lutheran orthodoxy in this area of theology. The following quotes clearly reveal
Arndt's view of justification.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You must take care that you do not connect your works and the virtues that you have
  begun, or the gifts of the new life, with your justification before God, for none of man's
  works, merit, gifts, or virtue, however lovely these may be, count for anything. Our
  justification depends on the exalted, perfect merit of Jesus Christ, received by faith, as
  it is sufficiently discussed in chapters 5, 19, 34, and 41 of this book, and in the first
  three chapters of Book II. Take great care, therefore, not to confound the righteousness
  of faith with the righteousness of the Christian life, but make a clear distinction
  between them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<a href="#Footnote28B"></a><a name="Footnote28A">Footnote28</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Through this faith (in Christ) we receive forgiveness of sins, in no other way than
  through pure grace without any of our own merits (Eph. 2:8) but only by the merits of
  Christ&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Even if it (our faith) is weak and we are still hemmed
  around with many sins, these are covered over out of grace for Christ's
  sake&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;From this you can see that works cannot make you righteous.
  First, you must be established in Christ through faith and be righteous in him before you
  can do any good work. See to it indeed that your righteousness is the grace and gift of
  God that comes before all your merit.<a href="#Footnote29B"></a><a name="Footnote29A">Footnote29</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In like manner, Spener clarified to his accusers the orthodoxy of his view of
justification. Three passages will suffice to demonstrate this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We gladly acknowledge that we must be saved only and alone through faith and that our
  works or godly life contribute neither much nor little to our salvation, for as a fruit of
  our faith our works are connected with the gratitude which we owe to God, who has already
  given us who believe the gift of righteousness and salvation. Far be it from us to depart
  even a finger's breadth from this teaching, for we would rather give up our life and the
  whole world than yield the smallest part of it.<a href="#Footnote30B"></a><a name="Footnote30A">Footnote30</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know, believe and teach that as far as our justification is concerned, it takes place
  out of pure grace for the sake of Christ and is not in the least reflected directly or
  indirectly by our holiness or righteousness. If anyone should endeavor to mix anything of
  human worthiness, I would oppose that person from the bottom of my
  soul&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;none of our works or merits avail anything but only the
  merits of Christ, not what He has done in us but for us by Him. When we say that faith
  saves, I understand that such saving is not a work of faith as if it were a virtue that we
  possessed and therefore belong among works but that one receives justification only by
  God's grace and Christ's merit alone.<a href="#Footnote31B"></a><a name="Footnote31A">Footnote31</a></p>
</blockquote>
<i>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Ought we not also bring such sacrifices (ourselves and our good works) to God the
  Lord in order to make atonement for our sins?</i>&quot; No, for Christ alone has made
  satisfaction for us by his sacrifice, and he who wishes to add to it his own sacrifice for
  atonement blasphemes the sacrifice of Christ (Heb. 10:14).<a href="#Footnote32B"></a><a name="Footnote32A">Footnote32</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Francke also clearly stated his theology of justification in terms designed to disprove
all charges of heresy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1. We are justified only by faith in the Lord Jesus without merit or the addition of
  work in that the Heavenly Father because of the perfect satisfaction and the precious
  merit of his Son judges us free and liberated from all our sins.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>2. Through this justification, which occurs through faith, the justified person becomes
  completely and totally perfect; indeed, it is seen as the justification of God himself, as
  St. Paul writes: God made him who knew no sin to be sin for us that we might become the
  justification of God (2 Cor. 5:21). Just as God looks on the Lord Christ as sin (because
  our sins were reckoned to him), so he sees the sinner as just and completely perfect
  because he gives to the sinner as the sinner's own the innocence and righteousness of
  Christ.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>3. He who does not have this perfection cannot become holy. Perfection is nothing other
  than faith in the Lord Jesus and is not in us or ours but in Christ or of Christ for whose
  sake we are considered perfect before God and thus his perfection is ours by
  ascription&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>10. From this it follows that both the following statements are true in a certain
  sense: We are perfect, and we are not perfect. Namely, we are perfect through Christ and
  in Christ through our justification and according to the righteousness of Christ ascribed
  to us. However, we are not and will not be completely perfect in the sense that we will
  nevermore be able to grow, to set aside evil and to take on good toward sanctification.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>11. The one who does not wish to err in this matter must distinguish well the article
  concerning justification and that concerning renovation or sanctification. Otherwise he
  will increasingly become entangled in controversy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<a href="#Footnote33B"></a><a name="Footnote33A">Footnote33</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;God
  having thus received me into his grace by faith in his son Jesus, I am not at one time
  justified and at another time not: but I am always and constantly in God's
  favor&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<a href="#Footnote34B"></a><a name="Footnote34A">Footnote34</a></p>

<b>

<p align="CENTER">Faith as <i>Fiducia</p>
</i></b>

<p>One of the the key contributions of the Pietists to Protestantism's view of
justification was its insistence that justifying faith is<cite> </cite><i>fiducia</i>
rather than <i>assensus</i>. </p>

<p>The Pietists insisted that biblical faith is more than merely mentally assenting to
doctrinal truths (<i>assensus</i>); it is a personal faith (<i>fiducia</i>) which lays
hold of the life of Christ and therefore results in regeneration and sanctification. To
prove that this definition of faith was no doctrinal innovation, Spener was fond of
quoting Luther's &quot;Preface to Romans, &quot; where he says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But it (unbiblical faith) is a human imagination an idea that never reaches the depths
  of the heart, and so nothing comes of it and no betterment follows it. Faith, however, is
  a divine work in us. It changes us and makes us to be born anew of God (John 1:13). It
  kills the old Adam and makes altogether different men of us in heart and spirit and mind
  and powers, and it brings with it the Holy Spirit. O, it is a living, busy, active, mighty
  thing, this faith, and it is impossible for it not to do good works incessantly. It does
  not ask whether there are good works to do, but before the question rises it has already
  done them and is always at the doing of them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&quot;<a href="#Footnote35B"></a><a name="Footnote35A">Footnote35</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Luther did not develop or emphasize this dimension of faith because his primary battle
was against the works soteriology of Roman Catholicism. But the Pietists <i>did</i>
develop and emphasize it because their battle was against the dead orthodoxy of
Confessional Lutheranism.<a href="#Footnote36B"></a><a name="Footnote36A">Footnote36</a>
This passage from Luther thus became a key part of their defense that they were not
overturning the Reformation, but merely continuing it.<a href="#Footnote37B"></a><a name="Footnote37A">Footnote37</a></p>

<p>Arndt develops this view of faith as one of his main themes in <i>True Christianity</i>.<a href="#Footnote38B"></a><a name="Footnote38A">Footnote38</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>True Christianity consists, not in words or in external show, but in living faith, from
  which arise righteous fruits, and all manner of Christian virtues, as from Christ himself.<a href="#Footnote39B"></a><a name="Footnote39A">Footnote39</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that faith consists in living, consoling trust and not in empty sounds and
  words&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;This is true knowledge of God, which arises out of
  experience and consists in living faith. Therefore, the Epistle to the Hebrews calls faith
  a substance, a being, an undeniable witness (Heb. 11:1). This is a piece of the inner,
  spiritual worship, the knowledge of God, which consists in living faith, and faith is a
  spiritual, living, heavenly gift, light and power of God.<a href="#Footnote40B"></a><a name="Footnote40A">Footnote40</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the living and working faith and in the following of the holy life of Christ, the
  true living knowledge of Christ consists.<a href="#Footnote41B"></a><a name="Footnote41A">Footnote41</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spener stresses the personal and experiential dimension of biblical faith in
&quot;Christian Joy.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The basis of joy (is) the assurance of divine grace. Joy is not without peace; it
  follows upon justification that is upon forgiveness of sins (Rom. 5:1; 1 John 3:21). True
  faith takes on such assurance; insofar as we are joyous insofar do we
  believe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Ps. 73:18. This faith brings it about that we know the
  proper good because we have and have grasped it as a present reality. . .<a href="#Footnote42B"></a><a name="Footnote42A">Footnote42</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In <i>Pia Desideria</i>, Spener stresses the spiritual dimension of biblical faith and
the moral change it effects.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Accordingly they (i.e., nominal Lutherans) have such a fleshly illusion of faith (for
  godly faith does not exist without the Holy Spirit, nor can such faith continue when
  deliberate sins prevail) in the place of faith that saves&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;So it
  is that all those who live under the rule of sin, with the consequence that they have no
  capacity for the Holy Spirit and hence for true faith, can have no other kind of faith
  than such human delusion.&quot;<a href="#Footnote43B"></a><a name="Footnote43A">Footnote43</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That Francke agreed with Arndt's and Spener's view of true faith is evident from his
comments in &quot;A Letter to a Friend Concerning the Most Useful Way of Preaching.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;let a minister carefully and clearly
  distinguish&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;between mere morality and true religion, between the
  moral honest man and the believer who, from a deep conviction of the depravity of his
  nature and the errors of his life, has learned to hate sin from his heart and lives by the
  faith of the Son of God&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to enquire
  if&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;they can find in themselves the genuine marks of a true
  conversion to God, and a living faith in Christ&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<a href="#Footnote44B"></a><a name="Footnote44A">Footnote44</a></p>

<p>The Relationship Between Justification and Sanctification</p>
</font>

<p>It is in their understanding of the relationship between justification and
sanctification that Arndt, Spener and Francke made their greatest impact on Protestantism.
Though historians do not deny the <b>fact</b> of their impact in this area, they hotly
debate the <i>value</i> of it. Some regard German Pietism as a terrible aberration of
Reformation soteriology.<a href="#Footnote45B"></a><a name="Footnote45A">Footnote45</a>
Others regard it as the recovery and development of the true soteriological spirit of the
Reformation.<a href="#Footnote46B"></a><a name="Footnote46A">Footnote46</a> It falls
outside the scope of this project to make a detailed study of Luther's understanding of
the relationship between justification and sanctification. Rather, the views of these
three German Pietists will be surveyed and evaluated.</p>
<b>

<p align="CENTER">Justification is Evidenced by Sanctification</p>
</b>

<p>It was the emphasis on <i>fiducia</i> that developed German Pietism's view of
sanctification. The kind of faith which justifies is also the kind of faith that
regenerates and sanctifies.<a href="#Footnote47B"></a><a name="Footnote47A">Footnote47</a>
If there is no evidence of sanctification, there is no evidence for regeneration and
therefore no evidence for justification. Sanctification thus becomes the proof that one
has been justified.</p>

<p>Passages from <i>True Christianity</i> and <i>The Garden of Paradise</i> suggest that
although Arndt believed in justification by faith, he saw sanctification as a non-optional
component of justification to such an extent that sanctification is a practical evidence
of justification.<a href="#Footnote48B"></a><a name="Footnote48A">Footnote48</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since Christ now lives and dwells in you through faith, his indwelling is not a dead
  work but a living work&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it renews you in Christ so that you grow,
  blossom, and live in him. What is the use of a graft in a stem if it does grow and bring
  forth fruit?<a href="#Footnote49B"></a><a name="Footnote49A">Footnote49</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can a person who believes on Christ at the same time have a desire to sin, not wish
  to leave sin, for which Christ had to pay with his blood and death, and with his
  life?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Therefore, all those who call themselves Christians
  crucify Christ again and hold him up to contempt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;They cannot
  partake of the sufferings of Christ for they have tread on the blood of Christ with their
  feet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;they must experience the righteous judgment of
  God&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<a href="#Footnote50B"></a><a name="Footnote50A">Footnote50</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Christ understood the whole newborn man, the tree with its fruits, renewed through
  faith, in which Christ lives and dwells through faith. Such faith he will find in few.
  Where one does not follow Christ in his life through faith, there is neither faith nor
  Christ, but that one is cast out and denied.<a href="#Footnote51B"></a><a name="Footnote51A">Footnote51</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where Christ is, a holy life exists in man&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;This relationship
  and unity of Christian faith and life is described in 2 Peter
  1:5ff.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Peter says expressly: The person who does not have such
  unity and Christian faith does not know Christ; he has lost faith and walks in darkness.
  That is true faith which renews and makes the whole man alive in Christ so that Christ
  lives and remains in him and he in Christ.<a href="#Footnote52B"></a><a name="Footnote52A">Footnote52</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is a most false and absurd thing for any one to profess himself a Christian, and yet
  to lead at the same time an unchristian life; or to pretend to faith and the true church,
  and yet never produce any of its true and genuine fruits&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<a href="#Footnote53B"></a><a name="Footnote53A">Footnote53</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The passages above show that Arndt wrote in such a way that he left himself vulnerable
to the false charge of teaching justification by works.<a href="#Footnote54B"></a><a name="Footnote54A">Footnote54</a> Even though this charge is refuted by Arndt's
affirmation of justification by faith, he is in this writer's opinion excessively rigid
because he does not describe sanctification as a gradual process punctuated by moral
lapses. </p>

<p>Spener was also accused of teaching justification by works by many orthodox Lutheran
theologians of his day.<a href="#Footnote55B"></a><a name="Footnote55A">Footnote55</a> The
following statements explain Spener's vulnerability to this charge.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;this sin (drunkenness), too, must once and for all be
  renounced if they are to be children of God&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;unless such sins are
  earnestly and resolutely rooted out these vicious and unrepentant persons will lose their
  salvation&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;If some advance the argument that drunkenness cannot
  be so grave a sin because, if it were, there would be very few true Christians among us, I
  shall accept the conclusion&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&quot;<a href="#Footnote56B"></a><a name="Footnote56A">Footnote56</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>For Godly faith cannot exist without the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit cannot exist
  along side of premeditated and prevailing sins.<a href="#Footnote57B"></a><a name="Footnote57A">Footnote57</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the faith, which alone justifies us and makes us holy, is inseparable from good
  works, so no one will be justified other than those who are intent upon
  sanctification.&quot;<a href="#Footnote58B"></a><a name="Footnote58A">Footnote58</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;pure doctrine and holy living must necessarily be united in
  the case of those who want to be saved&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<a href="#Footnote59B"></a><a name="Footnote59A">Footnote59</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the basis of passages like these, Brown is correct when he says that Spener saw good
works as &quot;a<cite> </cite><i>conditio sin quo non</i>, necessary attributes which
inhere in salvation.&quot;<a href="#Footnote60B"></a><a name="Footnote60A">Footnote60</a>
He also seems to share Arndt's excessively rigid view of sanctification which does not
allow for serious moral lapses.</p>

<p>Francke focused on propagating Spener's understanding of Christianity, so it is not
surprising that we find in his works the same emphasis sanctification as the evidence of
justification.<a href="#Footnote61B"></a><a name="Footnote61A">Footnote61</a> In Francke's
writings, though, there is a much greater emphasis on the love of God which motivates
sanctification and the power of the Holy Spirit which empowers sanctification. Perhaps
this emphasis was Francke's corrective to the harsh language used by Arndt and Spener
concerning the necessity of sanctification for those who wish to be justified.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>6. If the newborn Christian acknowledges such sins of the flesh, he strives with all
  earnestness against the evil which arises in his flesh. And he does so not through his own
  power and strength,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but through the spirit (sic) and he depends
  on the power of Jesus Christ which is made sanctification for him and conquers the evil in
  him.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>7. In such sinful habits and crimes the justified man remains, however, never standing
  in one position, but through the grace of God he sets aside ever more and more the evil,
  and day to day grows in faith and in love&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<a href="#Footnote62B"></a><a name="Footnote62A">Footnote62</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Insomuch as I cease from all my workings and am convinced that of myself I can do
  nothing but sin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but depend purely on God's
  grace&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;my heart begets new strength&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and
  the new man, as a good tree, breaks out in blossoms which send forth a sweet odor and
  bears fruits that are acceptable to God and man. It is not another way by which I have
  been justified and again another by which I seek to be sanctified, but it is one in the
  same way, to wit, Christ. . .As I depend on nothing but Christ whenever I pray for
  forgiveness of sins, so I depend on him alone and turn to his grace and power only
  whenever I desire to be strengthened in faith, love, and hope. Yes, all that I have to do
  is to abide by in the grace which I have received&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Then the work
  of God will be accomplished in me. For God wants none of my help for the accomplishment of
  his work. If I do but suffer myself to be prepared by him like a child in the mother's
  womb, not resisting the operations of his spirit, then he himself will work in me whatever
  is pleasing to him. Nevertheless it is by no means his will that I should be inattentive;
  and, instead of true resignation, fall into negligence or seek rest and peace in nature.
  For thereby I should even imperceptibly lose his workings.<a href="#Footnote63B"></a><a name="Footnote63A">Footnote63</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it is a very great moment that a minister not only instruct
  his hearers what they must do and how they ought to act, but that he also labor fully to
  apprise and to convince them by the evidence of Scripture of their own native weakness and
  impotency for all that is spiritually good. And that he further show them, by the same
  word of truth from which they must look for, and from whom they may hope to receive, all
  grace and strength, not only to renew their souls in their first conversion but also
  afterwards to enable them to perform every duty as well of inward religion. They must be
  told that they can do nothing without Christ, according as he has assured us, Jn. 15:5,
  &quot;Without me ye can do nothing&quot;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Thus the holy apostles
  preached. These were the topics which they insisted much upon, and if their example is not
  followed in this matter, it will be no wonder if our modern preaching comes vastly short
  of the success of theirs. And by this means some of our hearers will be in danger of
  sinking into a mere legal frame and spirit of bondage while they are pressed to duty and
  working, but not encouraged by the grace of Christ nor directed where to look for strength
  to perform it.<a href="#Footnote64B"></a><a name="Footnote64A">Footnote64</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The love of Christ ought to be much more insisted on by preachers than what is commonly
  done, because when we apply ourselves in right manner to his passion, death, and
  atonement, his merit and that purchase of salvation which he hath made for us, the
  knowledge of his love to us, and of our pardon and justification through faith in his
  blood, it is the truest spring and most powerful attraction of our love to him. Now the
  more we love Christ and that for this very reason, `because he first loved us,' the better
  will every branch of our religion flourish, every other grace and every duty will flow
  from its proper fountain. Therefore, the more a minister endeavors to instill this
  principle of sacred love into the hearts of his hearers, the more comfortable success will
  he probably see of his labors in their spiritual improvement and growing obedience to the
  gospel.<a href="#Footnote65B"></a><a name="Footnote65A">Footnote65</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="CENTER">Evaluation</p>

<p>Arndt, Spener and Francke reestablished the biblical relationship between justification
and sanctification which had been practically severed by Confessionalist Lutheranism. By
insisting that those who are justified will evidence it by sanctification, they implicitly
called into question the doctrinal validity of Confessionalism, which did not stress any
practical connection between justification and sanctification. This is probably the reason
for the Confessionalist's severe attack on the Pietists.</p>

<p>While this emphasis is the proper corrective to dead orthodoxy<a href="#Footnote66B"></a><a name="Footnote66A">Footnote66</a>, it can easily lead in practice to a legalistic emphasis
on good works which forgets that sanctification is a gradual process punctuated by moral
lapses.<a href="#Footnote67B"></a><a name="Footnote67A">Footnote67</a> In this writer's
opinion, Arndt and Spener were vulnerable to this interpretation by those who read them.
Francke appears to have best understood this danger and supplied the corrective to this
tendency in his emphasis on God's role in sanctification.</p>
<font face="Arial">

<p>The Relationship Between Justification and Water Baptism</p>
</font>

<p>It is fair to say that in their doctrinal understanding of the ritual of water baptism,
Arndt, Spener and Francke agreed with each other and with the doctrine of classic German
Lutheranism. But they were reacting against what they saw as a mechanical view of baptism
promoted by their Confessionalist contemporaries.</p>
<b>

<p align="CENTER">Their Doctrinal Understanding</p>
</b>

<p>Arndt, Spener and Francke agreed with Luther that infant water baptism was a means of
&quot;prevenient grace&quot; whereby the infant was placed in objective state of grace by
God.<a href="#Footnote68B"></a><a name="Footnote68A">Footnote68</a> In keeping with
Lutheran teaching, they also insisted that baptismal grace must be later confirmed by
faith in Christ to actually effect justification.<a href="#Footnote69B"></a><a name="Footnote69A">Footnote69</a> Because they were accused by the Confessionalists of
Pelagianism, all three men sought to refute this charge by affirming the Lutheran view of
baptism. </p>

<p>Arndt expressed his belief that one's objective standing with God was changed through
infant baptism in all of his important written works. Consider the following passages.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dear Lord Jesus Christ, you who have. . .instituted the holy sacrament of baptism. . .I
  thank you from the heart that You have through this sacrament led me into the holy
  Christian Church and thereby made me a partner of all your heavenly and eternal benefits.
  . .through baptism you have clothed me with your holy obedience, merit, righteousness,
  holiness, and innocence. Through the waters of baptism the Holy Spirit has created new
  life and changed a sinner into one who has been justified. . .You have received me because
  of your eternal grace and promise and bound me unto Yourself through this means of grace.
  . .<a href="#Footnote70B"></a><a name="Footnote70A">Footnote70</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Through the Holy Spirit's power and activity, man is newborn. The new birth occurs
  first through the Holy Spirit (Jn. 3:4). This is what the Lord calls &quot;to be born of
  the Spirit.&quot; Secondly, it occurs through faith (I Jn. 5:1). In the third place it
  occurs through holy baptism (Jn. 3:5).<a href="#Footnote71B"></a><a name="Footnote71A">Footnote71</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a means to it (our salvation), holy baptism is ordered by which we are baptized in
  the death of Christ so that we might die with Christ to our sins by the power of his death
  and once again arise from our sins through the power of his resurrection.<a href="#Footnote72B"></a><a name="Footnote72A">Footnote72</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where the Spirit of God is, there also is the Spirit's power, salvation, regeneration,
  renewal; all this is the work of the Holy Spirit. Therefore we know that we are born again
  through baptism. . .and cleansed from our sins.<a href="#Footnote73B"></a><a name="Footnote73A">Footnote73</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spener was in complete agreement with Arndt in his view of baptism, as is made clear in
the following citations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nor do I know how to praise Baptism and its power highly enough. I believe that it is
  the real &quot;washing of regeneration and renewal in the Holy Spirit&quot; (Titus 3:5),
  or as Luther says in the Catechism, &quot;it effects forgiveness of sins, delivers from
  death and the devil, and grants (not merely promises) eternal salvation&quot;.<a href="#Footnote74B"></a><a name="Footnote74A">Footnote74</a></p>
</blockquote>
<i>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;How does Baptism point to it (our obligation to build up other Christians)?&quot;</i>
  Since by it we are united to Christ, and so all become members of one spiritual body, this
  communion also imposes the obligation that one member shall, according to his ability,
  further the best welfare of the other (I Cor. 12:18; Eph. 4:15f.).<a href="#Footnote75B"></a><a name="Footnote75A">Footnote75</a></p>

<p align="CENTER">The Necessity of <i>Fiducia</p>
</i></b>

<p>The real difference between Arndt, Spener and Francke and the Lutheran Confessionalists
was on their insistence that baptismal grace must be confirmed by personal faith (<i>fiducia</i>)
in Christ rather than mere mental assent (<i>assensus</i>) to doctrine if it is to have
any lasting value.</p>

<p>The Confessionalists' view of Christianity did not emphasize the necessity of making a
personal commitment to trust Christ for one's justification. As has already been shown,
they held that mental assent to the creedal statements was sufficient. With such a
perspective typically comes a corresponding belief in ritual as efficacious in itself.<a href="#Footnote79B"></a><a name="Footnote79A">Footnote79</a> Thus, it was commonly assumed
that unless someone expressly denied Christ, they had &quot;faith&quot; in Christ and thus
remained in the state of baptismal grace conferred upon them as an infant. For all intents
and purposes then, many Germans believed that they permanently entered a state of grace at
infant baptism.</p>

<p>While the German Pietists did not reject the Lutheran doctrine of baptism, they
reaffirmed that it could not<cite> </cite><i>keep</i> a person in a state of grace unless
that individual came to <i>personal</i> faith in Christ. By emphasizing the personal
nature of saving faith and the moral change by which it was evidenced, they rejected the
validity of mental assent faith. This in turn led them to warn against depending upon the
abiding efficacy of infant baptism. They saw this negative emphasis as necessary in order
to call people to genuine faith; one's false security in baptism must often first be
destroyed before one will come to true saving faith.</p>

<p>In <i>True Christianity</i>, Arndt does not expressly state that infant baptism must be
coupled with personal faith in order to stay in a state of grace. Rather, one reaches this
conclusion as a logical inference by his emphasis on the nature of saving faith and its
necessity. As Stoeffler says, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Arndt held the historic Lutheran view of baptism. In
  point of fact, however, he said little about it and put the emphasis on conversion,
  oneness with Christ, and a holy life.&quot; <a href="#Footnote80B"></a><a name="Footnote80A">Footnote80</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What was a logical inference from Arndt became an open declaration with Spener. Two
statements from <i>Pia Desideria</i> make this clear.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just as the above illusion of faith as the only means of salvation from our side does
  great harm, so from the side of the divine means of Word and sacraments the shameful
  illusion of an <i>opus operatum</i> is added. This is not less harmful to the church,
  leads many people to damnation, and strengthens the aforementioned false notion of what
  true faith is. We cannot deny--on the contrary, daily experience convinces us--that there
  are not a few who think that all that Christianity requires of them (and that having done
  this, they have done quite enough in their service of God) is that they be baptized, hear
  the preaching of God's Word, confess and receive absolution, and go to the Lord's Supper,
  no matter how their hearts are disposed at the time, whether or not there are fruits which
  follow, provided they at least live in such a way that the civil authorities do not find
  them liable to punishment&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It (baptism) will be in vain that you
  comfort yourself in your Baptism and in its promise of grace and salvation if for your
  part you do not also remain in the covenant of faith and a good conscience or, having
  departed therefrom, return to it with sincere repentance. Accordingly if your Baptism is
  to benefit you, it must remain in constant use throughout your life.<a href="#Footnote81B"></a><a name="Footnote81A">Footnote81</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nor is it enough to be baptized, but the inner man, where we have put on Christ in
  Baptism, must also keep Christ on and bear witness to him in our outward life.<a href="#Footnote82B"></a><a name="Footnote82A">Footnote82</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Francke continued Spener's emphasis on the uselessness of baptism unless it was
accompanied by personal faith.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thus you ought not to say, &quot;I am baptized, I go to church, I am a Christian.&quot;
  The hypocrites do the same. There is many a person baptized who yet went back on his oath
  and was faithless and fell out of his baptismal covenant&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;You
  must make no decisions (about whether you are justified) because you follow externals
  (i.e. baptism, church attendance, communion). The Scripture is directed to your heart and
  indicates how you must find proper certainty and be sealed by the Spirit of God. You must
  receive the Spirit of God from God and from it you must know how richly you are graced by
  God. See, there you are commanded, there you might know what happens in the heart of God
  for your sake, whether God loves you, whether you are his child.<a href="#Footnote83B"></a><a name="Footnote83A">Footnote83</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="CENTER">Evaluation</p>

<p>Arndt, Spener and Francke held an orthodox Lutheran view of baptism. They saw baptism
as a means of prevenient grace which must be confirmed in adult life by personal faith in
Christ in order to have permanent validity. They disagreed, however, with both the
Confessionalists' and the common people's view of baptism who essentially viewed it as a
permanent entrance into grace. They struggled to maintain the Lutheran view of baptism
while stressing the supreme importance of personal faith in Christ as the sole assurance
of salvation.</p>

<p>It is the opinion of this writer that Arndt, Spener and Francke were struggling with a
Lutheran doctrine which was logically contradictory and biblically unnecessary. </p>

<p>There is an inherent logical tension in the Lutheran doctrine on baptism which Arndt,
Spener and Francke inherited. On the one hand, Lutheran doctrine affirms that baptism
effects an objective change in the infant's standing with God, placing the infant in the
sphere of God's grace. On the other hand, it affirms the necessity of exercising faith in
Christ in order to be justified. Many have noted the difficulty of understanding why faith
is necessary if baptism places one under grace, or why baptism is effective if faith is
what justifies.<a href="#Footnote84B"></a><a name="Footnote84A">Footnote84</a></p>

<p>It is evident from the writings of both Luther and the Lutheran Pietists that the
source of this &quot;tension&quot; is their interpretation of several New Testament
passages which teach that &quot;baptism&quot; objectively changes our relationship with
God.<a href="#Footnote85B"></a><a name="Footnote85A">Footnote85</a> It appears that
neither Luther nor the Lutheran Pietists ever seriously questioned the Roman Catholic
interpretation of these passages as referring to Christian water baptism. If it is granted
that these passages refer instead to the baptism by the Holy Spirit into Christ (I Cor.
12:13), an invisible event which occurs at the moment of faith (Eph. 1:13,14), the
apparent biblical and logical &quot;contradiction&quot; disappears. Water baptism is then
understood as an outward affirmation of what has already taken place at the moment of
personal faith in Christ (see Acts 10:44-47).</p>

<p>Rather than challenge the Lutheran doctrine of baptism, the Lutheran Pietists simply
emphasized the necessity of coupling baptism with personal faith. But the tension inherent
in Lutheran baptismal doctrine was such that many later Pietists wrestled with their views
of baptism.<a href="#Footnote86B"></a><a name="Footnote86A">Footnote86</a> The adoption of
believers-only baptism became one of the distinctives of the Radical Pietists.</p>
<font face="Arial">

<p>Conclusion</p>
</font>

<p>Arndt, Spener and Francke were in agreement with Luther and Lutheran orthodoxy that
justification is a gift of legal righteousness received by faith alone. </p>

<p>They were insistent that the faith that justifies is a living, personal faith (<i>fiducia</i>)
rather than a barren mental assent to orthodox creeds (<i>assensus</i>). In this area,
they were more in keeping with the teaching of Luther than their Confessionalist
contemporaries, though admittedly Luther did not develop this theme to a great degree. </p>

<p>Arndt, Spener and Francke were also in agreement with Luther and Lutheran orthodoxy
about the meaning of baptism as a means of prevenient grace which must be later confirmed
by personal faith. But their emphasis on <i>fiducia</i> as necessary for justification led
them to decry the false confidence that many Germans had placed in their baptism as an <i>ex
oper operato</i> rite.</p>

<p>From their insistence on living faith, they concluded logically, biblically and
experientially that sanctification will follow and give evidence of justification. It was
this position that called forth from their Confessionalist contemporaries the charge that
they were overturning the Reformation by reintroducing works as a condition for
justification. </p>

<p>Throughout their lives, Arndt, Spener and Francke consistently denied that they were
overturning the doctrine of the Reformation. They did not even claim to be
&quot;completing&quot; the Reformation that Luther began, though some have charged that
they did. Rather, they saw themselves as a reform movement within Lutheranism, calling for
a return to the spiritual dynamic between justification and sanctification that they read
in scripture and in Luther, and that they had experienced in their own lives.<a href="#Footnote87B"></a><a name="Footnote87A">Footnote87</a></p>

<p>Paul indicates this in 1 Cor. 5:6-8, where he says that serious sin which goes
undisciplined is like &quot;leaven&quot; which leavens the rest of the loaf (the local
church). Properly exercised, it has the ability to restore the spiritual vitality of the
local church so that the believers walk in &quot;sincerity and truth.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="#Footnote17A"></a><a name="Footnote17B">Footnote17</a></p>

<p>&quot;Quite as serious is another difficulty which is always associated with a
territorial church. In such a situation nearly everybody who happens to be born, baptized,
and confirmed in a particular territory is a member of the Church. Under these
circumstances the Christian ethic tends to lose itself in a commonly accepted folk
morality. This is especially true when the emphasis of the Church's witness is upon assent
to doctrinal truth and when the doctrine of the Christian calling is watered down to mean
little more than obedience to authority and acceptance of the <i>status quo</i>.&quot;

<p>&quot;The basic requirement for being a Christian was to recognize these statements of
church doctrine as being the authoritative formulations of the essence of divine
revelation contained in Scripture. All the people had to do was accept them. In the
meantime, the vitality of the people's faith declined, and their spiritual lives
suffered.&quot; G. Thomas Hallbrooks, ed., <i>Pietism</i> (Nashville: Broadman Press,
1981), p. 149. Stoeffler concurs with this evaluation when he says that &quot;the emphasis
of the Church's witness (was) upon assent to doctrinal truth. . .&quot; Ernest F.

<p>&quot;People attended church partly because they were required to do so by law, and
attendance was sometimes thought of as a good work whose mere performance gave them credit
in God's sight. Even more was participation in the Lord's Supper regarded as an act which
had a mechanical effect on one's relation to God, and most people were regular
communicants, whether once a year, once a quarter, or (occasionally) once an month.&quot;

the meaning of faith as <i>fiducia</i> rather than the more current emphasis on faith as <i>assensus</i>.

faith alone he desired to stress the idea that justification is meaningless from the

<p>&quot;Precisely at a time when Lutherans were understandably intent upon defending the
heritage of the Reformation. . .Arndt discerned behind the theological conclusions of
Luther the function of doctrine as the perimeter around the experience of penance and
salvation; in short, he brought to light again the spontaneity of Christian service as the
true fruit of a living faith. Arndt is entitled to the honor of being the first
&quot;Luther scholar&quot; to see, underscore, and apply Luther's vision that
justification by faith alone does not preclude but, to the contrary, unleashes good works

<p>&quot;It (faith) is in essence, he thought, absolute trust in Christ and commitment to
him. Here he differed markedly from many of his contemporaries to whom faith at best was
trust in a historic act rather than commitment to a person.&quot; Ernest F. Stoeffler, <i>The

<p>&quot;Arndt discerned behind the theological conclusions of Luther the function of
doctrine as the perimeter around the experience of penance and salvation; in short, he
brought to light again the spontaneity of Christian service as the true fruit of a living
faith. Arndt is entitled to the honor of being the first `Luther scholar' to see,
underscore, and apply Luther's vision that justification by faith alone does not preclude
but, to the contrary, unleashes good works in terms of the whole Christian, his action in
the Church and in the world.&quot; Heiko A. Oberman's preface in Johann Arndt, <i>True
Christianity</i>, trans. Peter Erb (New York: Paulist Press, 1979), p. xv.</p>

<p><a href="#Footnote47A"></a><a name="Footnote47B">Footnote47</a></p>

<p>&quot;Pietists in general held that the new birth must necessarily manifest itself in a
new pattern of life. . .Though denying that good works are necessary to justification,
they put a new stress on them as attributes which necessarily follow from an active,
living, justifying faith. They saw an intimate connection and coordination between
justification and sanctification due to the conviction that the faith which justifies is
also the faith which sanctifies.&quot; Dale R. Stoffer, &quot;The Background and
Development of Thought and Practice in the German Baptist Brethren (Dunker) and the
Brethren (Progressive) Churches (c. 1650-1979)&quot; (Ph.D. dissertation, Fuller
Theological Seminary, 1980), pp. 52,53. Oberman says, &quot;Unlike his Orthodox
contemporaries, Spener focused more on the subjective appropriation of the believer's
redemption than on God's objective saving act in history in the incarnation.&quot; Peter
C. Erb, ed., <i>Pietists: Selected Writings</i>, p. 6.</p>

<p><a href="#Footnote48A"></a><a name="Footnote48B">Footnote48</a></p>

<p>&quot;While Arndt thoroughly understood that the blessings of justification are
obtained solely by the merits of Christ, he insisted that they be accompanied by the
reality of sanctification. Arndt believed that while it is true that God alone knows
whether a man possess (sic) valid faith, it is also true, according to the teachings of
Jesus Christ, that a man's pattern of behavior gives a real indication of the genuineness
of his faith.&quot; George Samuel Spink, &quot;John Arndt's Religious Thought: A Study in
German Proto-Pietism&quot;, p. 163.</p>

<p>&quot;A quick perusal of the contents of.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<i>True
Christianity</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.reveals a heavy
emphasis&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;on the new life in Christ and the fruits that should
accompany such a walk. One is tempted to weigh the pages devoted to sanctification and
find what seems to be an inordinate amount of space spent on this doctrine and conclude
that to be a Christian one must attain to the virtues therein described thus confusing law
and gospel, justification and sanctification. . .It is very easy for the reader to skip
over Arndt's `Foreword to the Christian Reader'. . .where Arndt explains that he is going
to write on sanctification. If this is done, the reader can very easily surmise that Arndt
is talking about justification.&quot; Trygve R. Skarsten, &quot;The Doctrine of

<p>&quot;Spener went beyond Orthodoxy when he hinted that such works must necessarily
follow. Although he desired to disassociate himself from the formula that good works are
necessary for salvation, he practically implied it in the way he spoke of the necessity of
an active Christianity. He referred to good works as a <i>conditio sin qua non</i>,
necessary attributes which inhere in salvation.&quot; Dale Brown, <i>Understanding Pietism</i>,

<p>&quot;He (Francke) made sure that he absorbed thoroughly the Spenerian understanding of
Christianity and that he devoted his energies to its propagation by word and deed. .
.There can be no doubt about the fact that. . .the theological insights of Spener were not
only conserved but compacted by Francke into a clear-cut body of ideas which could be
communicated to the younger generation with relative ease.&quot; Ernest F. Stoeffler, <i>The

<p>The epistle of James applies this corrective to dead orthodoxy in Jas. 2:14-26. The
fact that neither Arndt, Spener, nor Francke quote James in support of their position is
probably due to Luther's doubts about its canonicity.</p>

<p>&quot;In perspective, one beholds consistently in the writings and thought of these
early Pietist leaders the effort to avoid the appearances and errors of moralism. Yet one
sees in the teleological test of doctrine a moralistic temptation. . .The shift from the
judging function of the law and the commandments to their role as requirements of
Christian life tended toward legalism. The application of the sanctification test to the
justification experience led in many cases to greater subjectivization. The attempted
classification of people into regenerate and unregenerate contained the potential seeds of
prideful self-assertion.&quot; Dale Brown, <i>Understanding Pietism</i>, p. 101.</p>

<p><a href="#Footnote68A"></a><a name="Footnote68B">Footnote68</a></p>

<p>&quot;Luther prized infant baptism precisely as a demonstration of God's prevenient
grace. . .The benefit of baptism, then is God's gracious covenant promise, which is no
merely symbolic word about some future effect, but the active presence of Christ Himself
beginning a new work in us to make us new. . .(baptism is) God's attested and operative
promise.&quot; Julius Bodensieck, ed., <i>The Encyclopedia of the Lutheran Church</i>,
(Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1965), Vol. 1, pp.180,183. As long as the necessity of
personal faith is not denied, Lutherans do not object to speaking of &quot;baptismal
regeneration.&quot; &quot;Lutherans have regarded it (baptism) as regeneration (Tit. 3:5,
cf. John 3:5). . .&quot; Bodensieck, p. 180.</p>

<p>While the Confessionalists themselves did not technically hold to this belief, it
appears that many of the common people did. Spener held the Confessionalists responsible
for the spread of this erroneous among the people. &quot;Just as the above illusion of
faith as the only means of salvation from our side does great harm, so from the side of
the divine means of Word and sacraments the shameful illusion of an <i>opus operatum</i>
is added. This is not less harmful to the church, leads many people to damnation, and
strengthens the aforementioned false notion of what true faith is. We cannot deny--on the
contrary, daily experience convinces us--that there are not a few who think that all that
Christianity requires of them (and that having done this, they have done quite enough in
their service of God) is that they be baptized, hear the preaching of God's Word, confess
and receive absolution, and go to the Lord's Supper, no matter how their hearts are
disposed at the time, whether or not there are fruits which follow, provided they at least
live in such a way that the civil authorities do not find them liable to punishment.&quot;

Stoeffler, &quot;In faithfulness to his Lutheran heritage Francke also spoke at times of
baptism as a means toward entering the new life. Following Spener, however, he made very
sure not to introduce any <i>ex opere operato</i> concepts into his theology of baptism.
For that reason he always speaks of baptism and faith together and makes it a special
point to say that the promise of salvation is not connected with baptism only. It appears
to have been his belief that the baptized infant finds himself in a relation of special
divine solicitude, which, however, never precludes the absolute necessity of a personal
decision for God either on the part of a child or an adult. At some point in the
maturation of the individual personal faith must be added to baptism.&quot; Ernest F.
Stoeffler, <i>The Rise of Evangelical Pietism</i>, p. 17.</p>

<p><a href="#Footnote84A"></a><a name="Footnote84B">Footnote84</a></p>

<p>Stoeffler agrees: &quot;The difficulty here is that Luther by insisting on salvation <i>sola
fide</i> and, at the same time, on a rigidly objective interpretation of baptism
bequeathed to posterity what comes close to a logical contradiction. The attempt to deal
with this contradiction has perennially exercised and often agitated the minds of Lutheran
theologians.&quot; Ernest F. Stoeffler, <i>The Rise of Evangelical Pietism</i>, p. 208.</p>

<p>Jn. 3:5; Rom. 6:3,4; 1 Cor. 12:13; Gal. 3:27; Eph 5:26; Titus 3:5; 1 Pet 3:21 all speak
either of &quot;baptism&quot; or of &quot;washing&quot; which unites us with Christ.
Lutherans typically refer to these verses as speaking of water baptism. See Julius
Bodensieck, <i>The Encyclopedia of the Lutheran Church</i>, Vol. 1, p. 180.</p>

<p><a href="#Footnote86A"></a><a name="Footnote86B">Footnote86</a></p>

<p>Of Arndt, Stoeffler says that &quot;He thus linked himself definitely with many of the
later Lutheran Pietists to whom the Lutheran doctrine of baptismal regeneration as
popularly held was always an occasion of regret or at least of embarrassment. . .&quot; Of
Spener, he says &quot;He never really rid himself of the strongly objective (sacramental)
overtones which are inherent (sic) in the Lutheran tradition. Accordingly he held that the
baptism of an infant establishes some sort of objective relationship between the baptized
infant and God, a relationship in which unbaptized persons do not find themselves. . .It
evidently did not occur to him that he was holding to two more or less radically disparate
views of salvation. The one is based on sacramentally infused grace, or at least on a
sacramentally induced change in God's attitude, the other on a personal faith commitment.
. .In view of this contradiction it is understandable that the doctrine of baptismal
regeneration lost more and more of its importance for Spener's followers who became
progressively aware of the difficulties involved.&quot; Ernest F. Stoeffler, <i>The Rise
of Evangelical Pietism</i>, pp. 208,242.</p>

<p><a href="#Footnote87A"></a><a name="Footnote87B">Footnote87</a></p>

<p>&quot;The many allusions, citations and references to Luther and the Book of Concord,
directly and indirectly, leads one to believe that seventeenth century Lutheran Pietism
saw itself as a reform movement returning to the dynamic and vibrantly alive doctrine of
justification that Luther and the Confessions had espoused and not a movement bent upon
completing the Reformation left unfinished by Martin Luther.&quot; Trygve R. Skarsten,
&quot;The Doctrine of Justification in Classical Lutheran Pietism: A Revisionist
Perspective&quot;, p. 28.</p>

<h3>1Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization, &quot;Christian Witness to the Chinese
People&quot;, in <i>Perspectives on the World Christian Movement: A Reader</i>, Ralph D.
Winter, Editor, (Pasadena, CA: William Carey Library, 1981) p.670. This source is from the
early 1970's. Similarly, by relying on the Government figures, WCE allows for 1,080,000
Chinese (Roman) Catholics, and 495.000 Protestants, with an additional 1,600,000 admitted
&quot;crypto Christians&quot; (secret Christians). Furthermore, only 114,000 Catholics,
and 70,000 protestants openly profess church affiliation. This is typical of sources
derived from the mid to early 70's. At the end of the article, the comment is added,
&quot;By 1981, evidence was increasing of very rapid church growth in many areas of China,
including among tribal peoples, with large numbers of young people everywhere.&quot; This
comment seems to be tacked onto the end of the article. <i>World Christian Encyclopedia: A
comparative study of churches and religions in the modern world AD 1900-2000</i>, David B.
Barrett Editor, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1982) pp.231-234. </h3>

<p class="style1">2&quot;There may be as many as 30 million Christians in China today. . . &quot; Jim
Falkenberg, &quot;A Word on the Word&quot;, in <i>The Quiet Miracle</i>, Vol. 63, No. 2
(Mar. 1985) p. 2. Compare G. Thompson Brown, <i>Christianity in the People's Republic of
China</i>, (Atlanta: John Knox Press, 1983) p. 178. Also, &quot;The respected Chinese
Church Research Center in Hong Kong claims that house-church members. . . total to 30
million an more. Privately, some Chinese officials say the figure is closer to 20 million.
&quot;A Church in Crisis Weeps and Prays&quot;, <i>Time Magazine</i>, Vol. 124 No. 12
(Sept.17,1984) p. 74. </p>

<p class="style1">3&quot;. . . now even conservative estimates range between 30 and 50 million.&quot; C.
Peter Wagner, On The Crest of the Wave: Becoming a World Christian, (Ventura, CA: Regal
Books A Division of GL Publications, 1983) p.30. Winter says, &quot;In China the
staggering truth is clearer every day: despite intense opposition. . .Christians have
grown from one or two million to easily 50 million.&quot; Ralph D. Winter, &quot;About
You,&quot; (Pasadena, CA: U.S. Center for World Mission, 1983) p. 2. One has to suspect
that this figure is exaggerated. However, the fact that scholars are making these
statements certainly point to breath-taking growth. </p>

<p class="style1">4Bohr says that there were 750,000 Protestant Chinese Christians. This figure is
apparently based on formal church membership, which may overlook some converts involved in
informal types of fellowship. He also says that there were over 3 million Catholics,
although much of this is to be discounted because of the Catholic practice of counting as
Catholics all those who have been baptized Catholic. Since no adult decision is implied,
the number claimed by the Catholic church is often unrelated to the number actually
attending mass with some regularity. Richard Bohr, &quot;State Religion in China Today:
Christianity's Future in a Marxist Setting,&quot; <i>Missiology: An International Review</i>,
Vol. XI, No. 3 (July 1983) p. 321,323 WCE allows 1,200,000 Protestants in the year 1900!
These figures are impossible to reconcile. World Christian Encyclopedia, David B. Barrett
Editor, p. 231. Winter allows 1-2 million true believers in 1949. See note #3 above.
Wagner holds for &quot;fewer than 1 million&quot; authentic believers in 1949. C. Peter
Wagner, <i>On The Crest of the Wave</i>, p. 30. </p>

<p class="style1">5This figure is even more difficult to ascertain with certainty. We will probably never
know how many Christians were killed in this modern holocaust. According to Judith
Banister, Chief of the Chinese Branch of the U.S. Bureau of the Census, &quot;More people
died in China during the period of the Great Leap forward than in all the battles of First
World War, or the holocaust of Europe's Jews, or the Soviet Collectivization and Stalin's
terror.&quot; Ansley of The National Academy of Sciences and Princeton University says
that &quot;about 27 million&quot; died. Both quoted in Carl Lawrence, <i>The Church in
China: How It Survives and Prospers Under Communism</i>, (Minneapolis: Bethany House
Publishers, 1985) pp. 31ff. It is not known how many of these were Christians, but it is
clear that a significant percentage of them were. </p>

<p class="style1">21As Wang Ching Wei, one of the leading opponents of Christianity put it, &quot;. . .
it (Christianity) is the wedge of foreign influence driven into our country by foreign
money and organization, controlled by foreign personnel and backed by foreign

<p class="style1">24It is interesting to note that there is very little biographical material available
that deals directly with Nee. The definitive biography (and the only complete biography
that I have found) is Angus Kinnear's excellent work, Against the Tide. A much shorter
summary appears in Norman H. Cliff, &quot;Watchman Nee-- Church Planter and Preacher of
Holiness,&quot; <i>Evangelical Review of Theology</i>, Vol.8 No. 2 (Oct. 1984). Otherwise,
there has been much more interest in Nee's doctrine than in his ministry. </p>

<p class="style1">28Cheung comments on the contrast between the vigor and wealth of the Little Flock
churches compared to the weakness and dependence of the other mission churches. &quot;The

life and the intensive training in the Word of God.&quot; James Mo-Oi Cheung, <i>The

<p class="style1">31II Thess. 3:8 Kinnear thinks that Nee was also stimulated by the business world, and
that this played a part in his decision. Angus I. Kinnear, <i>Against the Tide: The Story
of Watchman Nee</i>, pp. Cliff sees this period as a clear breech on Nee's part of his own
teaching on church finance. However, he does not explain his reasoning, and I am more
inclined to agree with Kinnear that it was in harmony with his teaching in <i>Concerning
our Missions</i>. See Norman H. Cliff, &quot;Watchman Nee-- Church Planter and Preacher of
Holiness,&quot; <i>Evangelical Review of Theology</i>, Vol.8 No. 2 (Oct. 1984):p. 294 </p>

<p class="style1">32According to Chua Wee Hian, in one of the early episodes of migration evangelism,
seventy families went into northwest China and thirty went into northeast China in 1930.

<p class="style1">39Watchman Nee, <i>The Normal Christian Church Life</i>, pp.97-111 This work was
originally published under the title &quot;On the State of Our Missions&quot; in Chinese.
Nee wrote a preface to the book expressing his reluctance to issue an English translation.
He said that he would prefer having a book published which &quot;better represents my
ministry&quot;. He added that he dreaded &quot;those who agree and would use it as a
manual for service&quot; far more than &quot;those who oppose and would use it as a chart
for attack,&quot; p. 6. Ironically, just as he feared, this book has been used by Witness
Lee to substantiate his doctrine of &quot;Locality&quot;. Although the book contains much
that is useful, the reader must remember that Nee was struggling with how to set up the
church in China (which often had no existing churches in a given locality), not with how
to reorganize American Christianity. See the critique of Nee's doctrine below. </p>

<p class="style1">40Very early in Nee's career while still with a student group in Shanghai, he had shown
his unwillingness to compromise on these issues, &quot;Nee and Leland Wang clashed, the
former strongly opposing the need for ordination or for Christian workers to receive fixed
salaries. Nee was asked to discontinue fellowshipping with these Christians.&quot; Norman
H. Cliff, &quot;Watchman Nee-- Church Planter and Preacher of Holiness,&quot; <i>Evangelical
Review of Theology</i>, Vol.8 No. 2 (Oct. 1984): p. 290. </p>

<p class="style1">44&quot;It is a shameful thing to profess to trust in God and yet play pauper,
disclosing one's needs and provoking others to pity.&quot; Watchman Nee, <i>The Normal
Christian Church Life</i>, p. 105. </p>

<p class="style1">45The example above (note # 31) illustrates this well. Nee actually advocates lying for
the sake of integrity! note p.104. In another incident, Nee refused to explain his own
actions during the war (because he believed it was vainglorious to defend one's self when
under attack), and as a result, was thrown out of the church! Angus I. Kinnear, <i>Against
the Tide: The Story of Watchman Nee</i>, pp. 165-166. </p>

<p class="style1">46For example Watchman Nee, <i>The Normal Christian Life</i>, (Wheaton, ILL: Tyndale
House Publishers, Inc, 1957) p. 66 on &quot;reckon&quot; and numerous other vocabulary and
textual notes in the same work. </p>

noted that he heard Nee say that he got through the New Testament once a month. </p>

<p class="style1">51Cited in James Mo-Oi Cheung, <i>The Ecclesiology of the &quot;Little Flock&quot;</i>
p. 6. The statement was changed after 1931, and dropped the anti-rational portion.
However, see his comment in 1948 that, &quot;We cannot dissect divine facts and outline
and systematize them. It is only the immature Christian who demands always to have
intellectually satisfying conclusions.&quot; Watchman Nee, <i>What Shall This Man Do? </i>(Fort
Washington, Pennsylvania: Christian Literature Crusade, 1967), p. 8. </p>

<p class="style1">52&quot;Spiritual inertia was never in fact a feature of the `little Flock' work. If
some groups. . . made Bible study their first exercise, most were very vigorous indeed in
their evangelistic witness and outreach. They supported it too with imaginative follow-up
of converts.&quot; Angus I. Kinnear, <i>Against the Tide: The Story of Watchman Nee</i>,
p. 156. </p>

<p class="style1">53Cliff's attempt to divide Nee's teaching career up into three stages is not
successful in my mind. The influences that Cliff says were present later, such as Keswick,
were also present earlier. One wonders whether Cliff is not confusing different periods in
Nee's ministry with different translators and publishers of his sermons. These tend to
coincidentally follow a rough chronological correspondence-- the Little Flock group in New
York publishing the later sermons. Norman H. Cliff, &quot;Watchman Nee-- Church Planter
and Preacher of Holiness,&quot; <i>Evangelical Review of Theology</i>, Vol.8 No. 2 (Oct.
1984). </p>

<p class="style1">54Angus I. Kinnear, <i>Against the Tide: The Story of Watchman Nee</i>, p.81. </p>

<p class="style1">55 See a ringing denunciation by Ranald McCauley and Jerram Barrs in <i>Being Human:
The Nature of Spiritual Experience</i>, (Downers Grove, ILL: Inter-Varsity Press, 1978)
pp. 44ff. with notes. What they call neo-platonism is actually neo-Chinese-ism. They also
exaggerate and unfairly quote Nee, taking several of the statements cited out of context.
They fail to adequately explain why, if an inner man- outer man dichotomy is so bad, does
Paul use the same language. It is clear that Nee's objectionable language is not coming
from Plato at all, but from Romans 7, and IICorinthians 4. It is also quite clear that in
several cases Nee's Chinese word for &quot;self-willed,&quot; or &quot;stubborn,&quot; is
translated &quot;reason&quot;. While I cannot speak to the translation issue involved, a
study of the context in Release of the Spirit, and Normal Christian Worker, will confirm
that there is a translation difficulty, because the word &quot;reason&quot; is
non-sensical in context. </p>

<p class="style1">56He said that Spiritual Man was too dogmatic and systematized, and that Concerning Our
Missions was liable to distortion. See note # 27 above and Watchman Nee, <i>The Normal
Christian Life</i>, (Wheaton, ILL: Tyndale House Publishers, Inc, 1957)p. . </p>

<p class="style1">57 Not a single audio tape or movie of Nee has surfaced. </p>

<p class="style1">58Cliff and Kinnear both noticed this trend. Norman H. Cliff, &quot;Watchman Nee--
Church Planter and Preacher of Holiness,&quot; <i>Evangelical Review of Theology</i>,
Vol.8 No. 2 (Oct. 1984)pp.293,294 and Angus I. Kinnear, <i>Against the Tide: The Story of
Watchman Nee</i>, pp. 180,181. </p>

<p class="style1">59 Witness Lee has founded the `Local Church' movement, which according to Cliff, is
&quot;exclusive and traveling a different doctrinal path to that of Nee.&quot; Norman H.
Cliff, &quot;Watchman Nee-- Church Planter and Preacher of Holiness,&quot; <i>Evangelical
Review of Theology</i>, Vol.8 No. 2 (Oct. 1984), p. 295. However, Cheung fails to see this
distinction. He even thinks that Witness Lee can be studied in order to discover Nee's
views on ecclesiology. But this overlooks important differences, particularly in the area
of ecclesiology. Lee took the mild tendency of Nee to allegorize Scripture to such radical
extremes that little if anything of Nee can be learned from studying Lee. Even Cheung
admits that Lee's teaching on the kingdom is heretical. James Mo-Oi Cheung, <i>The
Ecclesiology of the &quot;Little Flock&quot;</i> p. 15. <br>
Other off-shoots are not as radical. &quot;A group of assemblies formed by his colleague
Stephen Kaung on the east coast of the USA has been cooperative with all evangelical
causes, retaining the best elements in Nee's teaching.&quot; Norman H. Cliff,
&quot;Watchman Nee-- Church Planter and Preacher of Holiness,&quot; <i>Evangelical Review
of Theology</i>, Vol.8 No. 2 (Oct. 1984), p. 295. This author met Stephen Kaung in 1972.
He was a stirring speaker, deeply committed to the cause of Jesus Christ, but also seemed
somewhat legalistic and authoritarian. Again, these tendencies are not striking at all in
a Confucian society. <br>
In India, Bok Sing continues to lead a vigorous revival, but with some of the same
shortcomings mentioned above. </p>

indigenous Brethren Church movement which seemed at first an avowed rival to the
established mission-related churches, but Nee's strong emphasis on evangelical doctrines
and returning to biblical Christianity proved to be beneficial to all Chinese Christians.

<p class="style1">65Cliff also points out that Nee's influence has been considerable outside of China,
especially in the Catholic Charismatic Movement, and the so-called &quot;shepherding
movement&quot; associated with Mumford and others. His books are also, according to Cliff,
being studied regularly in mainline Churches in the USA, including Methodist, Lutheran,
and Baptist churches. According to Enroth, Ericson, and Peters, the so-called &quot;Jesus
Movement&quot;, read Nee as on of their few extra-Biblical sources. Norman H. Cliff,

<p class="style1">73 Interestingly, this posture is not new with Mao, but is in harmony with Chinese
tradition: &quot;Since the beginning of imperial times, over 2,000 years ago, religion was

Review</i>, Vol. XI, No. 3 (July 1983) p. 322. </p>

<p class="style1">78This is the argument in <i>The Quiet Miracle</i>, Vol.63, No.2 (Mar. 1985). The TSPM
church itself is basically the product of appeasement and compromise with the government. </p>

(Chicago: The Moody Bible Institute of Chicago, 1984), pp. 163-169 Rausch demonstrates

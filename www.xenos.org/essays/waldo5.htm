<h1>The Waldensian Movement From Waldo to the Reformation IV</h1>

<h5>By <a href="../personal/den.htm">Dennis McCallum</a></h5>

<hr>

<h3>Waldensian Beliefs Before the Reformation</h3>

<p>Either in 1184 or in 1215 the Waldensians were excommunicated from the Roman Catholic
Church.50 We know that in 1184 the French bishops who were called to the Council of Verona
included them in the list of &quot;condemned movements.&quot; Further, in 1190 the Bishop
of Narbonne pronounced a condemnation for heresy.51 </p>

<p>As in the case of Luther, over 350 years later, the excommunication of Waldo proved to
be the occasion of increased theological polarization. Tourn argues that during this
period, Waldo was influenced by &quot;the Cathari, Pierre de Bruys, the monk Henri and
others.&quot;52 From these schismatics, they heard stiff criticism of the Roman Catholic
Church. </p>

<p>For the first time, the movement began to include radical protest in its views.
Clearly, there was a need to re-define their views on the sacraments, and other features
of ecclesiology, since they no longer had access to these &quot;means of grace&quot;
through the Church. Yet the shift seems to have been minimal, especially in the area of
soteriology. There was still no breakthrough in the area of salvation by grace. On the
other hand, all of the changes that did occur during this period were in the same
direction as later reform movements. </p>

<p>Adding momentum to change was the merger with some northern Italian splinter groups.
These groups heard in the preaching of the Poor of Lyons views that they already held.
Latourette says that the Waldensians were &quot;. . .joined by many of the Humiliati, who
had arisen in and near Milan and in that same year (1184) had come under Papal
prohibition. . . They criticized prayers in Latin on the ground that they were not
understood by the people, and derided church music and the canonical hours.&quot;53 </p>

<p>These dissidents were established before the time of Waldo, and tended to have a more
communal ideal in their piety. They probably had the effect of stabilizing a movement
which was devoted to vagrancy by providing centers of agitation (this also made them easy
to locate, and therefore vulnerable). Milan had such a welcoming attitude that they
permitted the Waldensians to build their own house of prayer. This may have been the only
occasion on which they could openly have such a building for the next 300 years. </p>

<p>The Lombards, as the North Italian group was called, had many ideas of their own. They
were actually thrown out of the Waldensian movement in 1205 by Waldo, but later re-joined.
</p>

<p>Melia, who argues that the Waldensians were not Protestant in their doctrine, can be
counted on to refuse all exaggeration in the area of the Poor's evangelical beliefs. He
does admit (and documents each from more than one authentic Waldensian source) the
following listing of their divergent views during the period before the Hussite
revolution. 

<ol>
  <li>The Church of God has failed. </li>
  <li>The Holy Scriptures alone are sufficient to guide men to Salvation. </li>
  <li>The blessings and consecrations practiced in the Church do not confer any particular
    sanctity upon the things or persons blessed or consecrated. </li>
  <li>Catholic priests. . .have no authority; and the Pope of Rome is the chief of all
    heresiarchs. </li>
  <li>Everyone has the right to preach publicly the word of God </li>
  <li>Every oath is a mortal sin.54 </li>
  <li>Purgatory is a dream, an invention of the sixth century. </li>
  <li>The indulgences of the Church are an invention of covetous Priests. </li>
  <li>There is no obligation to fast, nor to keep any holy day, Sunday excepted. </li>
  <li>The invocation of Saints cannot be admitted. </li>
  <li>Every honor given in the Church to the holy images of paintings, and to the relics of
    Saints is to be abolished. </li>
</ol>

<p>To this list, he adds doctrines that belong to the period between the Hussite revolt
and the Lutheran Revolution: 

<ol>
  <li>Auricular Confession is useless, and. . .it is enough to confess our sins to God. </li>
  <li>The definition of the church is, &quot;the whole of the elect from the beginning of the
    world to its end.&quot; and that regarding ministries, &quot;the holy Catholic Church is
    the congregation of all ministers and people obeying the Divine will, and by obedience
    united. . .&quot; </li>
  <li>It is necessary to receive the Eucharist under two kinds.55 </li>
</ol>

<p>To these I would add, 

<ol>
  <li>The church and the state should remain as separate authorities.56 </li>
  <li>The Eucharist is to be viewed as a memorial, not as a sacrifice.57 </li>
</ol>

<p>You can see that <b>every one of these doctrines are the natural outgrowth of exclusion
from the Roman Church</b>. It was natural that the Poor of Lyons, feeling that they had
acted out of devotion to God from the beginning, would wonder whether denial of access to
the priestly functions of the Roman Church could alter their destiny. Especially with the
Bible in their own language, it was natural that they would re-examine these issues, and
ultimately deny Roman Catholic teaching in these areas. Therefore the rejection of
priestly function in the church was probably done in reaction to the action of the Roman
Church, rather than being a native sentiment of the movement. </p>

<p>Regarding the last point, on the Eucharist, it may be asked how the Waldensians thought
they would obtain salvation, since Roman Catholic doctrine has the grace of God becoming
effective through the sacraments. Here, it seems that no clear answer is available.
Apparently, the worshiper is to do his/her best to be good, and ask forgiveness from God
for the rest. There was also confession to a &quot;barba&quot; (&quot;uncle&quot; or
teacher-leader) and prayer on behalf of the penitent.58 Unfortunately, the grace aspect of
Huss' teaching seems to have been substantially lost on the Waldensians. </p>

<p>Given these tenets, there does not seem to be warrant for referring to &quot;two
reformations&quot; as does Amedo Molnar--the first being the Hussite and the Waldensian
movements, and the second, being the movements of the sixteenth century.59 At the same
time, it must be admitted that these two movements did make a substantial though
incomplete movement back toward the biblical model. The Waldensian movement was a
revolution based on radical ecclesiology, but without substantial change in soteriology.
Their contribution should not be disregarded any more than the Lutheran and Calvinists,
who continued to accept defective doctrine in the area of eschatology and ecclesiology.</p>

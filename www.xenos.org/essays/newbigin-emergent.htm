      <h3 align="left">Reviewed by <a href="../personal/den.htm">Dennis McCallum</a></h3>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Lesslie Newbigin is a brilliant
        writer, and served as a missionary in India for 40 years. Unfortunately,
        his analysis of postmodern society reveals that he is substantially persuaded
        by postmodern assumptions, to the extent that he undermines any basis
        for objective truth, for apologetics, or for the perspicuity (&ldquo;understandableness&rdquo;)
      of Scripture.</p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, Newbigin takes his
        place among the burgeoning caste of postmodern sympathizers writing on
        contemporary ministry (now increasingly known as the &ldquo;Emergent
        Church Movement&rdquo; or &ldquo;postconservatives.&rdquo;)<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote1anc" href="#sdendnote1sym">1</a></sup> In
        fact, this book is one of the handbooks read and quoted often by leaders
      in the movement. </p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Newbigin scores
        effective hits on modernistic rationalism, his attack overruns the opponent
        until he finds himself on ground alien to the biblical world view&mdash;the
        ground of postmodern perspectivalism. Not only rationalism, but rationality
        itself is jettisoned in favor of subjective mysticism and <i>a priori</i> blind
      faith.</p>
      <h2 class="western style1">Apologetics &ndash; a waste of time and a compromise
      with modernism</h2>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Newbigin begins by analyzing
        the interaction of Christianity and Western culture since the middle
        ages. He believes Christianity saw the rise of enlightenment rationalism
        and <i>fell back</i>, or <i>retreated</i> to a position where Christianity
        had to justify itself in rational terms. He never interacts with biblical
        authors&rsquo; or Christ&rsquo;s own efforts to give rational evidence
        for the gospel.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote2anc" href="#sdendnote2sym">2</a></sup> This
        discussion would have been interesting because such arguments in the
        Bible fly directly in the face of his anti-rational posture. If offering
        rational evidence for the truthfulness of Christianity is such a modern
        and pointless task, why do Jesus and Paul do exactly that repeatedly?
        Why did God waste so much time and effort recording a prophetic message
        in advance that would validate Jesus? Wasn&rsquo;t it Jesus who argued, &ldquo;all
        things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets
        and the Psalms must be fulfilled&rdquo;? (Luk. 24:44) It was not modernists,
        but Paul who argued that, &ldquo;that Christ died for our sins according
        to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third
        day according to the Scriptures.&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Cor. 15:3,4) If arguing
        from reason for Jesus is such an unspiritual approach, why does the Bible
        itself record that Paul, &ldquo;reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
        explaining and proving that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the
        dead.&rdquo;? (Acts. 17:2,3) Was it that Newbigin didn&rsquo;t know about
        these passages and many others that advance an intellectually defensible
        faith? Or was it that he purposely left them out of his discussion? In
        fact, biblical teaching has little or no role in Newbigin&rsquo;s discussion
      on this point.</p>
      <h2 class="western style1">&ldquo;Story&rdquo; versus Truth</h2>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Newbigin deplores Newton&rsquo;s
        suggestion that &ldquo;God provided two ways of making himself known
        to us: the book which we call the Bible, and the book of nature.&rdquo; This
        formulation is wrong, he feels, because, &ldquo;We are not, in this view,
        part of a story, a drama of creation, fall, redemption, and consummation.
        We are in a timeless world where timeless truths, valid for all times
        and all peoples, are being communicated in two different ways.&rdquo;<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote3anc" href="#sdendnote3sym">3</a></sup> Evangelical
        readers will naturally feel nervous when Newbigin suggests truths about
        God are not timeless, or that they don&rsquo;t apply to all people. We
        are left to wonder what God&rsquo;s truth is. Careful readers of the
        Bible will feel confused as to why Newbigin feels the need to falsely
        dichotomize story and propositional truth, when we see both advanced
        together and separately throughout the Bible. What are these &ldquo;stories&rdquo; that
        are put over against propositional truth? Is it the story of Jesus going
        to the cross and rising from the dead? Why would such a story be viewed
        as not advancing &ldquo;timeless truths, valid for all times and all
      peoples&rdquo;? Clearly, the story language is code for something else.</p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Newbigin&rsquo;s denial that
        we can apprehend objective truth is really a rejection of the notion
        that God has made his character &ldquo;evident within them,&rdquo; or
        that it &ldquo;is clearly seen through what has been created.&rdquo; (Rom.
        1:18) Newbigin does not feel that reason in any way points to Christianity,
        and he implies that any resort to reason in apologetics constitutes a
      capitulation to the enlightenment.</p>
      <p class="style1" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in"> I
        began to see.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [the domestication] in my own Christianity,
        that I too had been more ready to seek a &ldquo;reasonable Christianity,&rdquo; a
        Christianity that could be defended on the terms of my whole intellectual
      formation as a twentieth-century Englishman.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote4anc" href="#sdendnote4sym">4</a></sup></p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, he implies that reason
        is merely an English (read European) cultural bias, rather than a reliable
      tool for analyzing the world.</p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Instead, he argues that Christianity
        must be based on <i>dogma</i>. Dogma, which resonates with people, or &ldquo;seems
        right&rdquo; is, according to Newbigin, the style of argument used in
        the New Testament, and still the most appropriate. He does a good job
        demonstrating that other secular thinkers also resort to dogma in their
        so-called &ldquo;factual&rdquo; approaches to science and other disciplines.
        Likewise, no one can deny that Christian thinking must include faith
        assumptions at various points. But Newbigin&rsquo;s analysis, like other
        postmodern thinkers today, leaves us in a world where nothing can be
        known for sure, nor, for that matter, is anything even comparatively
        more likely than another. We simply pick our team and bark and screech
      for our side over against the others.</p>
      <p class="style1" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in"> Those
        who, through no wit or wisdom or godliness of their own, have been entrusted
        with this message can in no way demonstrate its truth on the basis of
      some other alleged certainties: they can only live it and announce it.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote5anc" href="#sdendnote5sym">5</a></sup></p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He claims that,</p>
      <p class="style1" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in"> The
        presupposition of all valid and coherent Christian thinking is that God
        has acted to reveal and effect his purpose for the world in the manner
      made known in the Bible.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote6anc" href="#sdendnote6sym">6</a></sup></p>
      <p class="style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.33in; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-after: auto"> But
        if all this is a presupposition, we are starting with God to arrive at
        God. All apologetics are a waste of time. Likewise, our basis for faith
        is identical to Muslims, cultists, or Communists. Faith with reasonable
        backing, or which is compatible with reason, is no better in this view
        than completely blind faith. Again, how different this is from Paul&rsquo;s
        approach! He felt called to &ldquo;persuade men.&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5) Newbigin
        never explains why someone would begin with an infinite personal God,
      or with the Bible.</p>
      <h2 class="western style1">The Sociology of Knowledge</h2>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">In a more serious error,
        Newbigin foolishly welcomes the sociology of knowledge (by name) and
      claims that,</p>
      <p class="style1" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in"> When,
        in any society, a belief is held to be &ldquo;reasonable,&rdquo; this
        is a judgment made on the basis of the reigning plausibility structure.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        Reason does not operate in a vacuum. The power of a human mind to think
        rationally is only developed in a tradition which itself depends on the
        experience of previous generations.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The definition of what
        is reasonable and what is not will be conditioned by the tradition within
      which the matter is being discussed.&rdquo;<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote7anc" href="#sdendnote7sym">7</a></sup></p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, all reason is reduced
        to nothing but cultural tradition, thinly veiled. This of course leads
        to a puzzling contradiction in Newbigin&rsquo;s own argument: How is
        he able to stand back and describe culture&rsquo;s &ldquo;group-think&rdquo; when
        he, himself must be a part of that group? Clearly, he believes he is
        doing the very thing he suggests is impossible&mdash;stepping outside
        his own culture&rsquo;s plausibility structure. But there&rsquo;s a double
        irony. Looking deeper, we discover Newbigin is not standing outside modern
        culture discovering the principles of sociology of knowledge at work.
        Instead, he is an illustration of his own point as he joins into the
        group-think of postmodern ideology! But if he is only aping his contemporaries,
      why should we take him seriously?</p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">His claims in this section
        are hollow for many reasons. If a culture&rsquo;s plausibility structure
        determines absolutely what people in that culture are able to accept,
        why do we see the antithesis of that in our world today? Evangelical
        Christianity is growing as never before, but almost entirely in the developing
        world (Asia, Africa, and Latin America).<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote8anc" href="#sdendnote8sym">8</a></sup> All
        of these cultures have no place for evangelical Christianity in their
        reigning plausibility structure. But in the west, where our plausibility
        structure is centered in our Christian history, Christianity is in decline!
        This is exactly the opposite of what Newbigin and other postmodern evangelicals
        predict with their culturally deterministic theories. Neither can they
        explain why Christianity took root in the first place when the Greco-Roman
      world had no place for it in their plausibility structure.</p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Newbigin correctly warns
        us that we should not try to advance Christianity by domesticating it
        to the reigning plausibility structure. Instead, we should challenge
        the reigning structure with the new. Unfortunately, only two paragraphs
      later he says,</p>
      <p class="style1" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in"> The
        dogma, the thing given for our acceptance in faith, is not a set of timeless
        propositions: it is a story. Here, I think, is the point at which we
        may well feel that the eighteenth-century defenders of the faith were
        most wide of the mark. The Christian religion which they sought to defend
        was a system of timeless metaphysical truths about God, nature, and man.
        The Bible was a source of information about these timeless truths.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        The Christian faith, rooted in the Bible is&mdash;I am convinced&mdash;primarily
        to be understood as an interpretation of the story&mdash;the human story
      set within the story of nature.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote9anc" href="#sdendnote9sym">9</a></sup></p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">First, Christian thinkers
        of the 18<sup>th</sup> century taught the Bible was far more than book
        of &ldquo;information.&rdquo; Theologians from this period were clear
        in insisting the Bible is good for information, as well as for a personal
      encounter with God through his word.</p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Secondly, instead of challenging
        today&rsquo;s views with the gospel, he has domesticated the gospel to
        the reigning postmodern plausibility structure. It turns out that the
        heart of Christianity is story interpretation&mdash;the very thing at
        the center of postmodern social analysis! In place of unchangeable, objective
        propositions, is the script, or narrative, and subjective interpretation.
        The old, na&iuml;ve approach was the one based foolishly on a system
      of timeless metaphysical truths. He claims that </p>
      <p class="style1" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in"> Philosophers
        of science have also shown convincingly that the popular dichotomy between &ldquo;facts&rdquo; (as
        what we know) and &ldquo;beliefs&rdquo; (of which we can only say, &ldquo;this
      is true for me&rdquo;) rests on an illusion.&rdquo;<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote10anc" href="#sdendnote10sym">10</a></sup></p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">So, what we thought were
        facts are really nothing more than subjective choices on our part to
        believe what we want. This is nothing short of a denial of our ability
      to know objective truth. And again,</p>
      <p class="style1" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in"> Facts
        do not imprint themselves on the brain like images on a photographic
        plate. They have to be grasped and understood. All so-called facts are
        interpreted facts.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What we see as facts depends on the
      theory we bring to the observation.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote11anc" href="#sdendnote11sym">11</a></sup></p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course Newbigin is right
        in saying that facts have to be understood and grasped &ndash; operations
        that require interpretation. But his last comment goes way further. We
        are only able to see as &ldquo;facts&rdquo; what our &ldquo;theory&rdquo; allow
        us to accept. The implication is clear and frightening: we are completely
        determined by our cultural pre-learning. What we observe will depend
        only on what we bring to the observation&mdash;but wait. Does that include
        this observation we just read? How can Newbigin make such sweeping truth
        affirmations without falling victim to his own critique? According to
        his own analysis, his claim that all facts are interpretation is only
        his own interpretation&mdash;only his own belief, &ldquo;about which
        we can only say, &lsquo;This is true for me.&rsquo;&rdquo; How, then,
      do we know that pre-learning completely determines what facts we see?</p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">I think Newbigin is painfully
      wrong.</p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Ask yourself: was it cultural
        pre-learning that showed 15<sup>th</sup> century Europe that the world
        was round? How could it be, when hardly anyone in Europe believed it
        before Columbus? Why do so many more people believe the earth is round
        today than then? Is it nothing but our cultural plausibility structure?
        Is this nothing but the latest interpretation of the story? Or could
        it have something to do with the &ldquo;fact&rdquo; that the world <i>really
        is round</i>? Might it not be that observation of facts in this case
        actually <i>overthrew</i> the reigning plausibility structure? Yes indeed.
        But such has no place in Newbigin&rsquo;s postmodern acceptance of the
        sociology of knowledge. According to him, all offers of evidence, whether
        eyewitness accounts of sailing around the world or satellite photographs
        would be a complete waste of time. Believers in the round earth could
      only live and declare their faith, hoping it might resonate with someone.</p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">This is a good example of
        how postmodern exaggeration sounds plausible until we notice it utterly
        fails to correspond with key points in history where individuals and
        even whole cultures have overthrown their own plausibility structures
      based on new arguments and evidence.</p>
      <h2 class="western style1">Relativism?</h2>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Newbigin tries to steer a
        course that falls short of utter postmodern skepticism, but he finds
        it difficult to affirm postmodern assumptions and still hold for any
        objective truth. After saying what we saw above, he goes on to make this
      statement:</p>
      <p class="style1" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in"> Nevertheless,
        I am responsible both for learning the skills and faithfully using the
        tools for understanding that my culture furnishes, and also for criticizing,
        refining, and even perhaps changing these tools. This is all my personal
        responsibility, and the beliefs which I hold are beliefs for which I
        must accept responsibility.... I am responsible for seeking as far as
        possible to insure that my beliefs are true, that I am&mdash;however
        fumblingly&mdash;grasping reality and therefore grasping that which is
      real and true for all human beings...<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote12anc" href="#sdendnote12sym">12</a></sup></p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">How can this statement be
        harmonized with the claims we just read, that the distinctions between
        facts and faith assumptions are illusions? If there is no difference
        between facts and &ldquo;that which is only true for me,&rdquo; how could
        I ever tell whether my beliefs are &ldquo;that which is real and true
        for all human beings&rdquo;? What test would I apply when raising this
      question? Newbie seems to be speaking from two sides of his mouth.</p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Am I exaggerating apparent
        contradiction in Newbigin&rsquo;s work? Not at all. One page earlier
        Newbigin repudiated the notion of &ldquo;truth as the correspondence
        between a person&rsquo;s beliefs and the actual facts.&rdquo; This correspondence
        theory of truth he calls &ldquo;bogus objectivity.&rdquo; And for rhetorical
        reasons, he places the correspondence theory in the mouth of one of the
        rankest of all modernists&mdash;Bertrand Russell! (Nothing is said of
        the vast majority of evangelical scholars who believe the correspondence
        definition of truth is exactly what the Bible teaches).<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote13anc" href="#sdendnote13sym">13</a></sup> Newbigin
        rejects correspondence because, &ldquo;I cannot apply this definition
        of truth to test my own perceptions of truth, since <i>there is no way</i> in
        which I can stand outside my own perception of the facts.&rdquo;<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote14anc" href="#sdendnote14sym">14</a></sup> (emphasis
      mine)</p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">But we must wonder, apart
        from the correspondence theory of truth what does Newbigin mean when
        he calls us to make sure &ldquo;my beliefs are true?&rdquo; In fact,
        how does anyone ever realize they are mistaken? How can we ever change
      our minds about anything?</p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">This self-contradictory form
        of argumentation is typical of most of the evangelical postmodern writers
        I have read, and I find it quite frustrating and even infuriating. The
      argument really follows the form:</p>
      <p class="style1" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in"> On
      the one hand, black is white.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
      <p class="style1" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in"> But
        at the same time, we have to remember that black should never be considered
      white!</p>
      <p class="style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.33in; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-after: auto"> As
        a result of this approach, critics who complain about the author&rsquo;s
        acquiescence to postmodern assumptions can be pointed to these apparently
        orthodox passages to show that they really haven&rsquo;t understood what
        the author meant. Yet the whole thrust of the work is in the opposite
        direction. For instance, Emergent authors routinely deny the validity
        of theology based on propositional truths, but in the same work adamantly
        claim they accept the historic creeds of the church&mdash;each one a
      series of propositional truths!</p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Newbigin is so self-contradictory
        one has to wonder whether he actually understands his own subject (a
        question raised often today by scholars examining Emergent literature).<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote15anc" href="#sdendnote15sym">15</a></sup> McLaren
        responds to these observations by claiming he is championing a different
        kind of postmodernism. He claims the postmodernism the rest of us (including
        non Christian scholars) refer to is a figment of our imagination. He
        says, &ldquo;This definition of postmodernism (it denies truth, denies
        reality, denies morality) is useful, I think, to scare people so they&rsquo;ll
        stay loyal to their modern institutions&hellip;.&rdquo; He thinks this
        kind of &ldquo;postmodernism probably doesn&rsquo;t exist outside the
        imaginations of frightened modern people and those who seek to intimidate
        them &ndash; plus among some college freshmen who get carried away after
        drinking too much.&rdquo;<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote16anc" href="#sdendnote16sym">16</a></sup> And
        yet his own and Newbigin&rsquo;s books teach exactly that, as we have
      just seen&mdash;the difference between facts and assumptions is an illusion. </p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the milder second form
        of postmodernism that is deconstructive and denies metanarratives, is
        hard to find, according to McLaren. &ldquo;Outside of sophomore English
        and graduate philosophy classes, you don&rsquo;t find this form of postmodernism
        much any more.&rdquo; This part made me wonder if McLaren ever spends
        time with non Christian students and younger people. For him to claim
        that those who think &ldquo;there is no such thing as objective truth&rdquo; are
        rare is incomprehensible. That is exactly what most students today believe,
        at least in our area. Where are these more mature postmodernists who
        see through the fallacy of relativism? In street interviews at our university,
        barely one in twenty students hold for any view other than complete relativism.
        I think it&rsquo;s incredible that McLaren would dare to suggest that
      postmodern people today are not relativists.</p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">I suspect that McLaren <i>et
          al</i>. are embarrassed by the discrepancies now demonstrated in their
          own analysis of postmodernism, and are reacting by inventing a form
          of postmodernism that is more domesticated and amorphous, mainly for
          rhetorical purposes. David Mills, who admits he doesn&rsquo;t understand
          postmodernism very well,<sup> <a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote17anc" href="#sdendnote17sym">17</a></sup> echoes
          McLaren&rsquo;s denial that postmodernism has to do with epistemology.
          He thinks the fact that cultural events have come along during the
          same period somehow negates the epistemological nature of postmodernism.
          We are left in the pitiful position where once again, Christians have
          their own definitions for mainstream words, and must take our place
          as a linguistic backwater, busily talking to ourselves, but incomprehensible
          to the rest of the world. Is there even one secular scholar who would
          agree with these bizarre claims about the nature of postmodernism?
          I think not. Christians should reject the formation of an intellectual
          ghetto where we assign our own meaning to words commonly used in secular
      culture.</p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Like Buddhist koans, Newbigin&rsquo;s
        self-contradictions pile up one on another. On one hand he argues that, &ldquo;The
        relativism which is not willing to speak about truth but only about &lsquo;what
        is true for me&rsquo; is an evasion of the serious business of living.
        It is the mark of a tragic loss of nerve in our contemporary culture.&rdquo;<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote18anc" href="#sdendnote18sym">18</a></sup> But
        how are we to avoid relativism if we accept his claim that the correspondence
        view of truth, &ldquo;implies a standpoint outside the real human situation
        of knowing subjects&mdash;and no such standpoint is available.&rdquo;<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote19anc" href="#sdendnote19sym">19</a></sup> I
        wonder, if truth doesn&rsquo;t have to correspond to reality, from what
        ground then, do we resist or refute relativism? Why can&rsquo;t Newbigin
        see that the position he just affirmed (that there is no way to know
        if something actually corresponds with reality) is exactly what makes
        relativism inevitable? This failure to connect the dots again makes it
      look like he actually doesn&rsquo;t understand his own subject matter.</p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">I think Newbigin answers, &ldquo;The
        Christian, on the other hand, will relativize the reigning plausibility
        structure In the light of the gospel.&rdquo;<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote20anc" href="#sdendnote20sym">20</a></sup> Is
        this different, or the same as that relativism he has just deplored?
        If our worldview &ldquo;relativises&rdquo; the rest of culture, aren&rsquo;t
        we saying the other world views are held relative to our view? How is
        this different than anyone else&rsquo;s relativism? He has already dismissed
        the possibility that other views are relative to any objective absolute.
        If all views are relative to other views that are also relative, in what
        sense has he avoided relativism? Again, if we hold our faith without
        any rational basis, only because &ldquo;it resonates with me,&rdquo; as
        he earlier suggested, what makes us think we are any different from the
      millions of relativists populating the postmodern west?</p>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">In view of the latent relativism
        in Emergent theology, we should not feel surprised to see their top leaders
      accepting universalism and denying the substitutionary death of Jesus.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote21anc" href="#sdendnote21sym">21</a></sup></p>
      <h2 class="western style1">Newbigin&rsquo;s view of the church</h2>
      <p class="western style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">When Newbigin turns to the
        church, his work is no less disturbing. His assessment of liberal theology
      is way too lenient and sympathetic, in my view.</p>
      <p class="style1" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in"> I
        am referring to the deep and tragic split which divides Christians between
        those who are usually labeled liberals and fundamentalists.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        There are on the one hand those who seek to identify God&rsquo;s revelation
        as a series of objectively true propositions, propositions which are
        simply to be accepted by those who wish to be Christians. And on the
        other hand there are those who see the essence of Christianity in an
        inward spiritual experience, personal to each believer, and who see the
        Christian doctrines as formulated during church history as symbolic representations
      of these essentially inward and private experiences.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote22anc" href="#sdendnote22sym">22</a></sup></p>
      <p class="style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.33in; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-after: auto"> I&rsquo;m
        sorry to see that Newbigin sees only two categories&mdash;fundamentalists
        (of which any who believe in objective, propositional truth are a part)
        or liberals. I find it interesting that, according to Newbigin, it is
        the Liberals who &ldquo;see the essence of Christianity in an inward
        spiritual experience, personal to each believer.&rdquo; Is there any
        conservative theologian who would deny this aspect? On the other hand,
        he fails to mention the outright denial of biblical truthfulness on the
        part of liberals (although to any able to read between the lines, this
        is the meaning when doctrines are &ldquo;symbolic representations&rdquo;).
        He says nothing of liberal theologians&rsquo; arrogant denial of the
        possibility of miracles, or their advancing their own propositional truths,
        like religious Darwinism, or that the biblical books could not possibly
        have been written by their claimed authors. His sympathetic portrayal
        of liberals combined with his frequent denunciations of &ldquo;fundamentalists&rdquo; also
      leaves little doubt as to where his own sympathies lie.</p>
      <p class="style1" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.33in; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-after: auto"> Finally,
        Newbigin also falls into the pit so many postmodern Christian thinkers
        are falling into. In the vacuum of authority left by their denial of
        an objective message in the Bible, they are driven to a new authority:
        the interpretive community. The interpretive community, or tradition,
        that we stand in, and which absolutely determines our interpretation,
        is the historic church. Therefore, Newbigin is like many who find themselves
        on the road back to Rome, or Eastern Orthodoxy. Why respect more recent
        traditions when they were based on the specious assumption of <i>sola
        scriptura</i>? Isn&rsquo;t <i>sola scriptura</i> (the reformation doctrine
        that the Bible alone, apart from tradition, has authority for Christians)
        the very thing Newbigin argues against and attributes to fundamentalists?
        Any belief that a text, whether ancient or modern, could yield a message
        that is in any way objective or determinative is considered pure modernist
        rationalism by Newbigin and other Emergent thinkers. Even if this deprecation
        of scripture as sufficient and clear were their only error, the Emergent
      movement would deserve powerful opposition from evangelical believers.</p>

          asked about exclusivism, inclusivism, conditionalism and universalism
          McLaren says in a recent post, &ldquo;I think that people can be good

          Carson documents McLaren&rsquo;s denial of hell as well as Chalke&rsquo;s
          denial of penal substitution. McLaren raised the same questions about
          penal substitution in fictional form placing the doubts in the mouth
          of a fictional character. D. A. Carson, <i>Becoming Conversant with

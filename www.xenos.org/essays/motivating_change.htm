<h3><font face="Arial">Introduction</font></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Christian living is all about change. Have you seen a character fault in 
    someone, a sin, that you wish you could help them with? For individual Christians, 
    God is in the business of changing our actions, attitudes, emotional responses, 
    and even our motives into conformity with Christ (Rom. 8:29). He also simultaneously 
    changes our lifestyles to reflect his value and priority on the importance 
    of leading non-Christians to a relationship with Christ and helping younger 
    Christians to grow in the ways just described. Whether we look at our need 
    for godly moral character or adopting a ministry lifestyle, we are talking 
    about change from where we were before we knew Christ, to where he would like 
    us to be. </p>
  <p>As Christian workers and leaders, we often see the need for change on a broader 
    scale as well. Our home group may be weak in a specific area of ministry, 
    or perhaps does not have a consensus on the mission of the group. Even our 
    local church as a whole might need to change its view in similar ways, or 
    change direction in the structure or ministry strategy. </p>
  <p>Clearly, stagnation &#151; personal or community-wide &#151; is antithetical 
    to a dynamic God who desires us to be more like his son in character, and 
    to hold his work as central to our life's mission. As God's workers, we are 
    key elements in how he desires to affect changes in other people's lives and 
    in the church. Often though, we are overwhelmed with the enormity of the problems 
    and confused about how to proceed to motivate change. How should we address 
    the issue? What do we say? Hopefully, this paper will help provide a model 
    for helping us motivate people or groups to change &#151; in the direction 
    God intends &#151; and with the motives he prescribes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><FONT FACE="Arial">The Dynamic Change Model</font></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>There are various models of change, and most have value under specific circumstances. 
    There is no one right way, nor is there a formula we can plug elements into 
    and have properly motivated change always result. However, particularly in 
    the early stages of motivating change (we will explain this qualification 
    later), there is one approach that best harmonizes the various biblical principles 
    that apply to Christians helping others to change. Yet, this approach allows 
    for flexibility depending on the individual's specific needs. We will call 
    it <b>&quot;the Dynamic Change Model</b>.<b>&quot;</b></p>
  <p>We will use Dennis McCallum's definition of motivation in the Christian context: 
  </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>People are motivated when they are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> 
        <p><font face="Arial"><B><I>convinced</I> </B>of the correctness and the 
          urgency of Christian goals; </font></p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p><font face="Arial"><B><I>willing to </i></B>admit their contrary actions, 
          attitudes, or values; </font></p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p><font face="Arial"><B><I>committed </i></B>and eager <B><I>to act </i></B>and 
          keep acting are willing to admit to their contrary actions, attitudes, 
          or values, in order to reach those goals regardless of what others do, 
          don't do, or think. (Dennis' paper, &quot;<a href="../classes/leadership/how_to_motivate_people.html">How 
          to Motivate People</a>&quot; provides practical insights on human nature 
          as it relates to motivation in Christian ministry).</font></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The central value of this description is the inclusion of proper actions 
      AND the internal drive perpetuating that action or attitude. Certainly the 
      early stages of motivation may need to include emotional support from others 
      to maintain perspective and promote actions. However, we cannot say people 
      are motivated in the true sense unless they carry on for proper reasons, 
      with or without support from others. Likewise, those who act without understanding 
      <I>why</I> they act may be motivated by the world's values, but not be driven 
      by their relationship with God. Unless we work through people's understanding 
      and consent, we may be manipulating rather than motivating. How can we help 
      people understand their situation and enhance their desire to change it, 
      without being manipulative?</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The basis for this model is understanding motivation to change occurs when 
  certain elements are present:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <ol>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The person understands and personally owns the goals and vision for 
          where she would like to be, and the biblical basis for that vision</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The person humbly admits, and personally owns where she falls short 
          of the vision, which includes actions, attitudes, thought-life, values 
          and priorities. She must know the biblical basis for this assessment.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">Tension</font> </b>results from #1 and #2. 
          Tension is produced when she wants that goal, believes in the vision 
          of what is important, yet <I>also </I>honestly admits and comes to grips 
          with how far she is from achieving that. <I>This tension is an essential 
          catalyst in the process of a person's motivation to change. Without 
          it, it is usually fruitless to press the person for change, and potentially 
          manipulative to do so.</i></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Based on #1,2, and 3, a practical, spirit-led plan for change is developed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Finally, with the above understanding, the person will need to reassess 
          the extent to which she wants the goal, God's goals for her life (#1) 
          in the area needing change that is being discussed. Now she can commit 
          to the efforts needed so that God can effect these changes.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <p>This model focuses on putting the <I>need</I>, <I>motivation</I>, <I>power</I> 
    and <I>direction</I> for change where it belongs between the person (or group) 
    and God. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Dynamic Change Model Diagram</font></B></p>
<blockquote> <img src="../graphics/change_model.gif" width="640" height="192"> 
  <p>The critical component is the development of <B><FONT COLOR="#800000">tension</font></B>. 
    This only occurs <I>within</I> the person as he chooses to &quot;own&quot; 
    the spiritual goal <I>and </I>his present status compared with that goal. 
    This tension should not be forced by anyone trying to help the young Christian 
    or group needing change. If the worker pushes, it usually leads to confusing 
    their motives for change (they might worry more about complying in order to 
    please you rather than God, or put up a wall resisting change, not because 
    they don't agree with the need, but because you are pushing them around). 
    The latter clearly contradicts the spirit of 2 Timothy 2:24-26.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The discipler or group leader's role in this process is to facilitate #1 
      &amp; #2 and perhaps share his own tension (they might also later help develop 
      a spirit-led plan for change). Another author terms this process of developing 
      tension to motivate change as &quot;unfreezing.&quot; He describes it in 
      a different order, but the same elements are present: </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;...unfreezing, or creating a motivation to change...is, 
        of necessity, composed of three very different processes, <I>each of which</I> 
        [emphasis mine] must be present to a certain degree for the system to 
        develop any motivation to change: 1) enough <I>disconfirming data</I> 
        to cause serious discomfort and disequilibrium; 2) the connection of the 
        disconfirming data to important goals and ideals causing <I>anxiety and/or 
        guilt</I>; and 3) enough <I>psychological safety</I>, in the sense of 
        seeing a possibility of solving the problem without loss of identity or 
        integrity...&quot; (Edgar H. Schein, &quot;Organizational Culture and 
        Leadership&quot;, (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1992), pp. 298,299.)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Let's see how this is applies to working with individuals and then groups.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><font face="Arial">The Dynamic Change Model Applied to Individuals' Needs</font></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Let us consider Paul's commitment to helping others change.</p>
  <p>That process of becoming complete in Christ entails change in character and 
    morals, as well as a lifestyle of ministry&#151;in other words, sanctification.</p>
  <p>Paul's description is a reflection of the Great Commission, it isn't something 
    that was unique to his ministry. We should be like Paul, laboring in the power 
    of God to help Christians live out their new identity by helping them go through 
    this life-change process (naturally this assumes our lives are changing as 
    well!). The dynamic change model works well in character and ministry issues. 
  </p>
  <p>EXAMPLE:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Let's consider a somewhat common example Christian workers experience when 
      helping motivate a young Christian to reach out to their friends and family. 
      Typically, in the earliest stages of a young Christian's life, they primarily 
      are receiving teaching and enjoying fellowship. Now the time has come to 
      point out that there is a goal to their spiritual walk outside of their 
      own benefits. Applying this process might look something like this:</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><I><font color="#800000"><b>Creating Vision: </b></font></i>The person 
        has a vision for growth when she understands and personally desires the 
        goals that God has described for her in the Bible. How do we help her 
        get to that point? </p>
      <p>During one of our regular times together with this young believer we 
        might tell her that we've been thinking about how God can use her to reach 
        the lost. We ask her if she has thought similarly. Draw her out on how 
        she sees God working through her in evangelism. </p>
      <p>The POINT is for her to see this area as GOD does, not as you do. Direct 
        her toward passages that speak of God's perspective in evangelism. She 
        must understand and agree upon its importance from <I>God's </I>perspective, 
        not just because you are saying it.</p>
      <p>She might already have some convictions in this area, but be prepared 
        to add to her vision if needed and communicate it with passion and excitement. 
        Incorporate what you know about her to show how her life can look in this 
        area. This vision might draw on her uniqueness: how God has spiritually 
        gifted her, her personality traits, opportunities she has, observations 
        you've made, experiences she has had in evangelism (including talking 
        about who reached out to her). </p>
      <p>By doing this, you set the stage for a grace-oriented discussion regardless 
        of her response to your initiative. Too often, leaders and workers start 
        the discussion with the next step in this model, omitting this important 
        part. </p>
      <p><B><I>If she doesn't see this goal or vision for her life, go no further 
        at this time</i>.</b> There is no sense in moving toward an honest assessment 
        of her own shortcomings, if she doesn't agree on the goal or believe it 
        is important. Ask her to pray, study the scriptures, and get input from 
        other Christians about the subject. Be willing to engage her again on 
        the topic in the relatively near future.</p>
    </li>
    <li value="2">
      <p><b><i><font color="#800000">Honest introspection: </font></i></b>Now 
        it's time to ask how she thinks she is doing compared to what she believes 
        are God's goals in evangelism (which they just articulated in #1). Be 
        careful to stay away from a legalistic finger-wagging session here. Allow 
        her to provide her own assessment; ask questions about why it is that 
        way, does she understand how God's grace covers any problems in this area, 
        etc. Often the worker is surprised by how clearly the person sees their 
        weaknesses without us elaborating! </p>
      <p>It is very important to also positively affirm any strides they have 
        made in the subject being discussed. It is often the discipler who has 
        to remind the younger Christian where they have seen positive steps. </p>
      <p>But overall, you have brought up the subject because you believe there 
        needs to be more positive movement and now <i>might be </i>the time in 
        this conversation to point out what you have or haven't seen that needs 
        to change, adding to what she has said, or broaching what she doesn't 
        see as a problem at all. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;Might be&quot; because ideally, they come up with most of what 
          you have noticed without you telling them in the early part of this 
          step. In that case, you still should agree that you have the same concerns.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>But, often the person only sees part of the picture and you'll need to 
        provide a more detailed picture of the concerns. It is key that you communicate 
        with an attitude of grace and vision where the person can be if there 
        is growth in this weak area.</p>
      <p>Be specific, and objective when possible, about your concerns. In our 
        example about weak outreach you might say something like: &quot;I agree 
        that you don't spend enough time building relationships with non-Christians. 
        Do you think your work schedule of 60-80 hours per week is related to 
        this? Are your values and priorities matching what you claim you'd like 
        to do in serving God?&quot; &quot;How do you relate 1 John 2:15,16 to 
        the problem?&quot; Or perhaps the lack of outreach is because they are 
        afraid of rejection, and this is exposed at this time. </p>
      <p><B><I>If she was willing to acknowledge the goal or vision (#1), but 
        not where her problems lie in respect to that vision, there is no sense 
        going any further</i>.</b> Ask her to think and pray through the concerns 
        you've described, and perhaps to ask other Christians for their input 
        on the subject as well. Give the Lord time to work and have follow-up 
        discussions with her. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>You will have to regulate the frequency of follow-up discussions based 
          on the subject of concern. If it is highly damaging to her or others, 
          potentially dangerous or very serious sin, there is call to move quickly 
          and frequently. However, most issues although needing to change, require 
          some prayerful consideration by the person (like the example we are 
          describing about developing an evangelism lifestyle), and it would be 
          inappropriate to badger her about this every time you get with her.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>If she has &quot;owned&quot; the first two parts, then she is experiencing 
        what we hoped for &#151; tension.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b><i><font color="#800000">Tension: </font></i></b>Tension results if 
        she has processed the vision and goals for her life in this area, AND 
        honestly admitted where she lacks in respect to that vision. Schein states 
        that it is the discomfort, guilt, or shame feelings that come when our 
        equilibrium has been disrupted. </p>
      <p>At this point, she has agreed with God's priority for every Christian 
        to be part of and acknowledged she should be part of the plan. She has 
        also admitted she is not living out that vision (including probably providing 
        specific examples). The resulting tension provides the proper motivation 
        to develop and act on a God-empowered plan (next step) for change.</p>
      <p>If there is no tension, then either she does not actually have the problem 
        you thought you discerned, or she hasn't actually come to grips with #1 
        and/or #2. <B><I>If this is the case, there is no sense in going to the 
        next step. It is time to return to #1 or #2, or both. Encourage her to 
        review what you have talked about, pray, and ask other mature Christians 
        that know her what they think.</i></b></p>
      <p>But, assuming there is a proper tension, or &quot;discomfort&quot;, it 
        is time for the next exciting step.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b><i><font color="#800000">Plan for Change: </font></i></b>This newly 
        motivated Christian needs a plan for change! It should be clear direction, 
        doable (not asking too much for where the person is in their walk), practical, 
        and in the power of God. </p>
      <p>Obviously, the worker should have thought this through beforehand (Hebrews 
        10:24), including getting advice if needed, so that he can provide solid 
        help. But during the discussion the person getting help should be encouraged 
        to think through a plan for herself before the worker gives their input. 
        We should give him time to continue to think this through and write their 
        ideas down over the next week or so. This is where teaching the basics 
        on walking in the power of the Spirit is essential. You may want to refer 
        her to the <A HREF="../classes/principles/cpu2w8.htm">Christian Principles</A> 
        overview on this subject.</p>
      <p>It is tempting to think that the job is done at this stage, but for two 
        reasons it is not. First, even if the person begins to act on the plan 
        for change, your follow-up help, reminders, and prayer will be instrumental. 
        It takes time, particularly for more substantive areas, to become a way 
        of life. And second.....</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b><i><font color="#800000">Count the Cost: </font></i></b> Now that 
        she sees exactly the plan entails, and the cost (EG. priority changes, 
        lifestyle sacrifice, financial sacrifice, humility to admit wrong, etc.) 
        she might question if she really wants to change. It is part of &quot;counting 
        the cost&quot; that Christ requires in Luke 14:27-31. If she begins to 
        vacillate in her commitment to change, encourage her to rethink the vision 
        for this area; to understand again what God's perspective is. Is this 
        what she really <I>want</I>s regardless of the work ahead?</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <P> You should encourage her to think through proper biblical motives for 
      all we do as Christian workers, especially as a response of gratitude for 
      the work Christ has done for us on the cross. Paul's exhortation in Romans 
      is exactly for that purpose as he launches into instructions on how they 
      should use their spiritual gifts:</P>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>12:1 I urge you therefore, brethren, <B><I>by the mercies of God</i></B>, 
        to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, 
        which is your spiritual service of worship.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In summary, the Dynamic Change Model provides the Christian worker with a 
    framework that helps another Christian develop:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> 
      <p>their own convictions of God's perspective in character or ministry weaknesses, 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <p>humility to assess their progress toward that goal, under grace</p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <p>a concrete plan of action based on the proper motives and our own real 
        source of power for change. </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h3><font face="Arial">The Dynamic Change Model Applied to Group Needs</font></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Home group leaders often see an area of weakness across the board in their 
    home group rather than limited to just a few individuals. Although the final 
    solution is for the individual members to go through the change process, the 
    <I>beginning point</I> of addressing broad-scale needs in a group is usually 
    addressing the group as a whole. Later, individual follow-up, similar to what 
    is mentioned above, will be helpful.</p>
  <p>Let's use the same example of &quot;lack of evangelism&quot;, but now as 
    a leader you recognize that it is a group-wide weakness and suspect that the 
    Christians in the home group are not living an evangelism lifestyle. </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><i><font color="#800000"><b>Creating Vision: </b></font></i> The first 
        step is for the group to agree on the goal or vision in the specific area 
        of weakness. </p>
      <p>In our example of group-wide weak outreach, we hold a meeting for the 
        Christian &quot;workers&quot; so the discussion can be frank (I.E. it 
        might be insensitive to non-Christians and also <I>perhaps</I> very young 
        Christians who don't understand the need for evangelism yet). One of the 
        better communicating leaders facilitates a discussion on God's view of 
        evangelism.</p>
      <p>Discussion includes the church's role in it, the mission of our home 
        group as it relates to that biblical view, and what it looks like, practically 
        speaking, in an individual's life to do evangelism. Discuss specifics 
        (E.G. consistent time spent building friendships with non-Christians) 
        as part of the vision and goal, so they can later (#2) objectively discern 
        how well they are doing in those areas. The leaders try to draw those 
        things out of the group first, rather than just teach the material&#151; 
        This facilitates a group consensus on the vision.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b><i><font color="#800000">Honest introspection: </font></i></b> Now 
        it is time to ask them to honestly assess &quot;how are we doing as a 
        group in this area?&quot; </p>
      <p>Schein's point on providing &quot;disconfirming data&quot; is excellent. 
        Whenever possible, rather than just appealing to your own opinion, offer 
        evidence from which the group can draw their own conclusions. In this 
        example, you could provide a chart that plots the growth of the group 
        and the number of first time guests.</p>
      <p>Then, as a leader, you can facilitate a discussion on the specific weaknesses 
        (attitudes, actions or non-action, etc.) of the group that contribute 
        to the weak evangelism. Compare the specifics of the vision in #1, with 
        their actual performance. Again, draw them out while they self-assess.</p>
      <p>Example: People admit their own personal hobbies and job have consumed 
        them to the exclusion of building friendships with non-Christians.</p>
      <p>If the group has &quot;owned&quot; #1 and now #2, this should lead to...</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b><i><font color="#800000">Tension: </font></i></b>As a whole, the group 
        will now feel tension as they realize they aren't living out priorities 
        and goals they agree are important. </p>
      <p>In this group setting, we cannot account for the reaction of everyone 
        to this process. But most members of the home group now will experience 
        discomfort as they admit they aren't successfully living out the area 
        (evangelism) they have just said is very important. The discussion and 
        self-discovery environment of the meeting usually lends itself to people 
        admitting what's important and verbalizing personal weaknesses. </p>
      <p>In other words, a consensus has been reached by the group and they want 
        things to change. This doesn't require everyone agreeing, just a general 
        sense of agreement from more than only the leaders. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><FONT color="#800000"><b><i>Plan for Change: </i></b> </FONT>Now it is 
        time to develop a plan for change. </p>
      <p>Again, the leaders should prepare to discuss key areas that need tuned 
        up and how to go about it. Ideally, the group discussion should bring 
        out most of these practical items. Even better would be if new ideas are 
        proposed that the leaders hadn't yet thought of!</p>
      <p>Example: People see the need to plan to set aside time for evangelism, 
        they have not been managing their time well. The group also decides a 
        <A HREF="../ministries/justforfun/index.htm"><I>Conversation &amp; Cuisine</I></A> 
        event is an excellent catalyst. The leaders decide to spend time in their 
        small men's and women's Bible studies equipping Christians in apologetics. 
        And people who meet during the week in shepherding or discipling relationships 
        resolve to pray specifically for outreach.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b><i><font color="#800000">Count the Cost: </font></i></b>It is time 
        for a reminder of the vision for where the group can be if as individuals 
        they step out in the ways discussed, and the sacrifices that are probably 
        involved as well. </p>
      <p>Now that the desire for change is there and some practical ideas are 
        on the table for that change, remind the group of <I>why</I> they should 
        do <I>what</I> they do. Remind them of the proper motives for ministry, 
        central of which is a response of gratitude for what Christ has given 
        to them. </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>At this point, the workers should resolve to continue discussion of this 
    topic when they get together in their various shepherding and discipling relationships. 
    Personal application, assistance, ongoing follow-up and prayer will best be 
    done in that context, versus in a meeting (not excluding the importance of 
    corporate prayer of course!).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><font face="Arial">Conclusion</font></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>God uses Christians to help one another change in character areas and to 
    adopt an other-centered ministry lifestyle. (Actually, these two are integral 
    to one another.) It is an astounding concept when we contemplate the Creator 
    of the universe choosing his fallen creation to play so key a role in his 
    plan. Because of this, we experience strong conflicting thoughts and emotions 
    when serving him in this way. Helping others change is one of the most fulfilling, 
    yet sometimes most frustrating and challenging aspects of Christian ministry. 
    The responses we encounter, our own ineptitude, and often our own sin can 
    make this ministry challenging. But the reward of God sanctifying us while 
    working through us in other people's lives makes it one of the most exciting 
    aspects of ministry. No wonder Paul uses words like &quot;labor&quot; and 
    &quot;striving&quot; to describe his role, and God's role as &quot;power, 
    which mightily works within me&quot; to accomplish it. </p>
  <p>And no wonder Paul understands the real source of his adequacy.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>2 Cor. 3:5 Not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as 
      coming from ourselves, but our adequacy is from God, 6 who also made us 
      adequate as servants of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit; 
      for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In other words, it is God who will perform this through us if we make ourselves 
    available to him.</p>
  <p>The Dynamic Change Model provides a highly practical framework guiding the 
    Christian worker in helping others change. It simultaneously puts the onus 
    of change where it really belongs, between the person who needs the help and 
    God.<br>

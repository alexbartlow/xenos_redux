<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a> </h2>

<p><big>In the literature of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, there appears the figure
of an intriguing man who had an exceptional impact on the society of his day. He is
referred to variously as Valdes, Valdesius, Valdensius and Waldo (Valdo), from the city of
Lyons. </big></p>

<p><big>References to the movement he founded (&quot;Waldensians&quot; &quot;the poor of
Lyons&quot; &quot;the Leonese&quot; &quot;the Poor of Lombardy&quot; or simply &quot;the
Poor&quot;) appear repeatedly throughout the succeeding centuries of European history.
They are always in the shadows, always under bitter persecution, always hard to
understand, but always seemingly at the cutting edge of reformation ferment.</big></p>

<h2><a name="Historiography">Historiography</a></h2>

<p><big>The actions and views of Waldo are shrouded in shadow, because neither he, nor
contemporaries in his movement ever chronicled their lives. No existing documents speak of
the exact year of his birth, of his youth, or even of the very last years of his life.1
This problem is made worse by the fact that the Poor of Lyons themselves desired to
establish an argument for their legitimacy based on antiquity. </big></p>

<p><big>In a day when there was only one legitimate church, the Poor of Lyons felt that
they had to answer the charge that they must be heretics because they were new. Therefore,
they developed an argument that they were the remnant of a movement that had been
resisting the Roman Catholic Church since the time of Constantine's donation of the
western empire to Pope Sylvester in the fourth Century AD. This claim depended on the
spurious documentation for the donation of Constantine, which both Catholics and
Waldensians believed to be authentic at the time but which is actually without historical
support.2 </big></p>

<p><big>This development would have been harmless enough, but unfortunately, some early
Protestant historians, writing in the 1600's were also in the market for a claim to
antiquity. They saw the Waldensians as the bridge between themselves and the Apostles.3
They were inclined to believe the legends of the Poor of Lyons, and unfortunately they had
possession of the earliest authentic Waldensian manuscripts.</big></p>

<p><big>These documents were compiled with commentary in a history written by Perrin,
pastor at Lyons in the year 1618.4 Perrin's history was commissioned by the Synod of
Dauphiny (which included the now reformed Waldensian Churches).5 A few years later, in
1655, John Leger, a Waldensian pastor, compiled another collection of source material,
which eventually wound up in the library of the University of Cambridge.6 Perrin and Leger
attributed dates to the documents which were far too early. Some Waldensians documents
were dated as early as 1100 AD, (at least 60 years before the movement began). Other
documents from the reformation period were dated as coming from before the reformation.
This had the effect of portraying the Waldensian movement as reformed in doctrine
throughout their history, whereas in fact they were not reformed until after the
reformation.7</big></p>

<p><big>In 1875, Alexis Muston published The Israel of the Alps, which, although critical
of some of the earlier work, such as Perrin's,8 continued to accept the basic thesis that
the Waldensians originated at the time of Sylvester. Almost every Protestant work done
since the time of Muston in turn has depended on his work until recent times. In fact,
studies carried out by denominations such as the Presbyterians as recently as 1912 have
continued to follow this line.9 Catholic sources are no better. Melia is an example of a
Roman Catholic author as recently as 1870 attempting to deny that religious persecution of
the Waldensians occurred at all.10 In the same way that John Leger accepted exaggerated
accounts of the persecution, Melia has accepted non-credible Roman Catholic accounts.</big></p>

<p><big>It is perhaps not surprising that study of the Waldensians has become unpopular
among scholars because it is viewed as the province of biased ideologues. For these
reasons, there are few contemporary histories of the Waldensian Movement that have
scholarly credibility.11</big></p>

<p><big>Because of these developments, it is difficult for the average student of history
to arrive at a clear picture of the chronology and development of the movement without
careful comparison of contradictory material. Further, in this case one must not only
compare different authors, but must also ascertain that they do not depend on each other.</big></p>

<p><big>All we have from the earliest period is a few fragmentary writings from letters,
commentaries and poems which circulated within the group, and a larger body of
contemporary material written by Roman Catholic clerics, all from a hostile point of view.
Therefore, as with so many &quot;heresies&quot; of the medieval period, it is necessary
for the student to read between the lines of detractors' comments to separate the facts of
the situation from the polemical elements in the inquisitorial literature.</big></p>

<p><a href="#Contents"><big>Return to the Table of Contents</big></a></p>

<h2><a name="Beginnings">Beginnings</a></h2>

<p><big>According to one report from an inquisition prosecution found in Church archives
in Carcassonne, France, the movement known as the &quot;Poor of Lyons&quot; began in about
1170. The document goes on to state that Waldo himself had been a rich merchant who
underwent a religious experience which led him to renounce all of his wealth, and &quot;.
. .observe a life of poverty and evangelical perfection, as the Apostles.&quot;12 This
sort of commitment can hardly be considered unusual during this period of history.
However, Waldo went further:</big></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>He arranged for the Gospels and some other books of the Bible to be translated in
    common speech . . . which he read very often, though without understanding their import.
    Infatuated with himself, he usurped the prerogatives of the Apostles by presuming to
    preach the Gospel in the streets, where he made many disciples, and involving them, both
    men and women, in a like presumption by sending them out, in turn, to preach.</big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>These people, ignorant and illiterate, went about through the towns, entering
    houses and even churches, spreading many errors round about.13 </big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><big>Here the heart of what the Poor were all about as well as the crux of their
dispute with the Roman Church is evident. Gui goes on later,</big></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>The principal heresy, then, of the aforesaid Waldensians was and still remains the
    contempt for ecclesiastical power. Excommunicated for this reason and delivered to Satan,
    they were precipitated into innumerable errors. . . The erring followers and sacrilegious
    masters of this sect hold and teach that they are not subject to the lord pope or Roman
    pontiff or to any prelates of the Roman Church. . .&quot;14</big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><big>The fact that Waldo and his followers rejected riches and lived an austere life
was not objectionable to the hierarchy of the Roman Church. The same thing was being done
by tens of thousands all over Europe. Neither do there seem to have been substantive
doctrinal differences at first.</big></p>

<p><big>This last point is important, because the most intriguing aspect of the Poor is
precisely that there was initially no important doctrinal difference. They saw themselves
as Roman Catholics who were carrying the doctrines of Christianity further than their
weaker brethren. They even sent a delegation to the third Lateran Council in 1179 to
obtain Papal approval of their work. There they were examined by an English friar, Walter
Mapes, who in 1184 was in Rome for the council. He recounts, </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>We saw Waldensian men in the Roman Council held by Pope Alexander the Third. They
    were simple and unlearned, and were thus called from the name of their founder, Valdo, who
    was a citizen of Lyons on the Rhone. They presented to the Pope a book written in the old
    Provencal language,15 in which there were texts and comments of the Psalms, and of many
    books of the Old and New Testament.16</big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><big>Mapes questioned them at the council along the following lines, </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>Do you believe in God the Father? They answered, &quot;We believe.&quot; And in
    God the Son? They answered &quot;We believe&quot; And in God the Holy Spirit? They
    answered, &quot;We believe.&quot; And in the mother of Christ? They answered &quot;We
    believe&quot;. . .</big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><big>At this point the court broke out in laughter because according to Scholastic
Theology, one could only use the formula &quot;believe in&quot; with reference to the
Trinity. After this conversation, the delegation &quot;withdrew, covered with
disgrace,&quot; because they had fallen for a trick question.17 They were ordered to cease
preaching, and obey their bishop. </big></p>

<p><big>It is easy to see from this incident that there was no serious issue of doctrine
at stake. The Waldensian dispute then, centered on the issue of authority. It was the fact
that they translated the scriptures, studied them, and &quot;presumed&quot; to preach what
they believed, without reference to the clergy that was unacceptable.18 Melia declares,</big></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>. . .when John a Bellismanibus, Archbishop of Lyons, about the year 1182 . .
    .forbade them both to preach and . . .expelled them from his diocese; no mention was made
    of their holding any doctrine at variance with the teaching of the Church: they were
    simply expelled because, being laymen and illiterate, . . . they presumed, against the
    prohibition of their superiors, to preach, and exercise an office which was confided to
    the Apostles and to their successors only.19</big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><big>They were arguing that they could draw insight directly from the pages of their
translated Bibles rather than from the Roman Church.20 As one of our earliest sources,
Alan of Lille put in his chapter entitled, &quot;By what authority and for what reason it
is shown that no one ought to preach unless he has permission from the Bishop,&quot;</big></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>There are certain heretics. . .called Waldenses, after their heresiarch, who was
    named Waldus, who--led by his emotions, not sent by God--founded a new sect and presumed
    to preach without the authority of the Bishop, without divine inspiration, without
    knowledge, and without literacy. He was an irrational philosopher, a prophet without a
    vision, an apostle without a mission, a teacher without an instructor, and his foolish
    disciples have led the simple folk astray in many parts of the world. 21</big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h2>The <a name="Historico">Historico</a>-theological Milieu</h2>

<p><big>Waldo was neither the first nor the only divergent voice raised inside and outside
of the Roman Catholic Church at this time and place. Europe was aflame with new religious
movements reacting to such things as the struggle of the Papacy for supremacy, the corrupt
practices of local clergy, and the currents of thought that were flowing into the area as
a result of the Crusades.22 The Albigensians or the Cathari were the leading schizmatic
group,23 but there were many other attacks as well. In 1140 the bishops of France wrote to
the Pope that,</big></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>Everywhere in our cities and villages, not only in our schools but at the street
    corners, learned and ignorant, great and small, are discussing the gravest mysteries.24</big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><big>In the history of this period we find reference to numerous heretical groups,</big></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>1. In 1259 the Flagellants appeared. By a kind of mass contagion men, women, and
    children bewailed their sins and many of them marched through the streets, naked except
    for loin cloths, crying to God for mercy, and scourging themselves until the blood ran.25
    &quot;They proclaimed complete certainty of salvation to all who should persevere in
    flagellation for thirty-three days. Scourging was the one necessary sacrament. They were
    condemned in 1349.&quot;26</big></p>
    <p><big>2. The Beguines comprised a variety of lay groups which seem not to have been
    confined to any specific set of forms and to have displayed wide variety. Deanesly says
    they were, &quot;the followers of Lambert le Begue, (the Stammerer). . . devout but
    unlettered lay people, who set great store on the use of vernacular scriptures. Lambert's
    followers were called from his surname, in Dutch, Beghards, (whence the English word
    &quot;beggar&quot;) in Latin Beguini or Beguinae.&quot; She claims that the early
    Waldensians joined forces with groups of Beguinae.27</big></p>
    <p><big>3. Tanchelm began to preach in the diocese of Utrecht and early in the twelfth
    century his views had fairly wide currency in the Low Countries and the Rhine Valley. He
    attacked the entire structure of the Catholic Church, denied the authority of the Church
    and of the Pope, and held that at least some of the sacraments were valueless.</big></p>
    <p><big>4. Early in the twelfth century, Peter of Bruys, himself following a strictly
    ascetic way of life, rejected the baptism of infants, the Eucharist, church buildings,
    ecclesiastical ceremonies, prayers for the dead, and the veneration of the cross. The
    Petrobrusians re-baptized those who joined them, profaned churches, burned crosses, and
    overthrew altars. </big></p>
    <p><big>5. Sometimes classed with Peter of Bruys, but perhaps mistakenly, was Henry of
    Lausanne. Like the former he preached in what is now France and in the first half of the
    twelfth century. Before his death in 1145 he is said to have attracted a wide following,
    called Henricians. He taught that the sacraments were valid only when administered by
    priests who led a life of asceticism and poverty. He condemned the clergy of the day for
    their love of wealth and power.28</big></p>
    <p><big>6. The Adamists conducted their worship in the nude.29</big></p>
    <p><big>7. Arnold of Brescia. . .was earnestly eager to see the Church conform fully to
    the Christian ideal. Believing that this could not be so long as its leaders compromised
    with the world, he attacked the bishops for their cupidity, dishonest gains, and frequent
    irregularity of life and urged that the clergy renounce all property and political and
    physical power. . .in 1155 he was hanged, his body was burned, and his ashes were thrown
    into the Tiber. . . .30</big></p>
    <p><big>8. In Northern Italy, &quot;. . .the &quot;Pataria&quot; had some years earlier
    grown up spontaneously in reaction to an increasing corrupt and politically oriented
    clergy.&quot; They were apparently the descendants of the Bogomils, who in turn grew out
    of the dualistic &quot;Paulicians&quot;.31</big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><big>In addition to these were numerous lesser movements, of which Latourette admits,
&quot;We shall probably never learn even the names of all of them.&quot;32</big></p>

<p><big>Even this short list demonstrates that there were questions being asked at this
time, many of which are strikingly similar to those issues raised by the Poor of Lyons: </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><big>--the question of poverty and asceticism as a means of growth and/or salvation, </big></li>
      <li><big>--questions about the role of ritual, </big></li>
      <li><big>--activism of various sorts among the laity, </big></li>
      <li><big>--questions about the integrity of the clergy.</big></li>
      <li><big>--questions about interpretation and application of the Bible.33</big></li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><big>It is likely that Waldo and his followers were influenced by some of these
movements, although it is not clear how much. It would be too coincidental to see such
common themes arising apart from any influence whatever. The fact is that there was a
cultural and religious milieu shaping the thinking of this movement.</big></p>

<p><big>For example, we can place Lyonese poor nuclei in the same area of France as the
Cathari, at a time when the Catharite revolution was at its height.34 Also, both southern
France and northern Italy were hot-beds of dissident zeal during the very period of the
rise of the Waldensians.</big></p>

<p><big>On the other hand, the Neo-Platonic and dualistic aspects of so many of these
groups is not as evident in the teachings of the Waldensians during the earliest period.
There is undoubtedly some platonic asceticism involved in Waldo' renunciation of wealth.
Many of the new groups, including the mendicant orders of monks were renouncing all wealth
at this time, and traveling around as beggars and preachers.35 </big></p>

<p><big>It is important to realize that the reason they did so was not in order to relieve
poverty through a more equitable distribution of goods, but because the suffering incurred
from being poor was good for the soul. The material world was viewed with suspicion, and
anything that served to separate one from it would bring him/her closer to the Spiritual
world, that is, closer to God.36</big></p>

<p><big>Significantly, shortly after the time of Waldo, Boanaventure would argue that
poverty had been Christ's pattern, carried on for some time by monks such as the Egyptian
anchorites, &quot;but poverty declined after the Donation of Constantine and was not
revived until the thirteenth century with the foundation of religious mendicancy by
Francis and Dominic.&quot; This view of history was identical to that held by the
Waldensians.37</big></p>

<p><big>Tourn and others argue that this ascetic ideological base was not the case with
the Waldensians. Their basis for renunciation of wealth was a literalistic application of
Lk. 9:3-6, and Mk. 10:23-27, which are not ascetic. In other words, &quot;. . .one might
say that Waldensian piety was eschatological rather than dualist or ascetic.&quot;38</big></p>

<p><big>This may be partially true for another reason. We find no reference to the
monastic literature anywhere in the early Waldensian literature. The Cistercian order,
which had been organized around 1119 believed that, </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>. . .the rule (of St. Benedict) was not merely a guideline or a set of positive
    laws which can be dispensed, but rather a species of Divine Law, which like the
    Commandments of the Gospel, has to be interpreted, but cannot be changed or dispensed.39</big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><big>This point of view, so typical of all of the orders at this time, is absent from
early Waldensian thinking. They based their movement of the authority of the scriptures.40</big></p>

<p><big>Another distinction between the Waldensians and the monastic idealists at this
time was the outward focus of the Poor of Lyons. They were not seeking primarily inner
piety, but aggressive outreach to others.</big></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>&quot;. . .Waldo's case was different [than most poverty enthusiasts]. His vow did
    not lead him to a monastery and to a life of contemplation and obedience. He was an
    ordinary citizen among the poor and was determined to remain so. . .41</big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>&quot;For the Poor the bond of unity lay not in the sacraments but in their
    apostolic mission. Christian virtue, then, was in demonstrating love, and care for the
    brethren.</big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>&quot;Everyone of them, old and young, men and women, by day and by night, do not
    stop their learning and teaching of others.&quot;</big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><big>An inquisitor quotes, in the same vein, one of the Poor who had been brought
before him: &quot;In our home, women teach as well as men, and one who has been a student
for a week teaches another.&quot; 42</big></p>

<p><big>Thus the Waldensians were more activistic and outreaching than sacramental or
reflective.43</big></p>

<p><big>Perhaps if there had been more dependence on monastic ideology the later history
of the Waldensians would have been very different. Not long after the time of Waldo,
another new order arose not far from the region of Lombardy under the leadership of
Francis of Assisi. The similarities between these groups is quite striking. </big></p>

<p><big>Both were operating in the same area at about the same time. Francis was also
untrained in theology. His followers, like the Waldensians, were unlearned. They lived in
voluntary poverty, dressing in course cloth and sandals--exactly like the Waldensians.
They traveled around sometimes and preached, as the Waldensians did, although the emphasis
with the Franciscans was more on service while that of the Waldensians was more on
preaching. Both were critical of the Roman Church's failure to fully live up to the ideals
of Scripture. Both went to Rome to obtain papal approval for their orders. And this is
where the similarity stops.</big></p>

<p><big>Francis did obtain approval from the Pope, while Waldo did not.44 Thus the
Franciscans were taken into the embrace of the Church. This exempted them from persecution
for the time being, and in fact, Franciscans were often leaders of the persecution of the
Waldensians. </big></p>

<p><big>The question of the relationship of the Waldensians to the other doctrinal
currents of that time is hard to determine exactly. There is no evidence of any influence
from other groups on Waldo himself, until after his condemnation. Earlier, for instance,
he directly denounced the Albigensians' doctrine.45</big></p>

<p><big>The most important point in this is that there was no ideological or theological
breakthrough that occasioned the Waldensian movement.46 Their existence was not the result
of any change in theology, but rather a change in theopraxy--the Poor of Lyons translated
the Bible, and preached it in their own words.47 Thus, the Waldensians are an early test
case in the area of lay ministry. Their main sin was to take too literally the Biblical
command to, &quot;. . .teach them to observe all that I commanded you.&quot; </big></p>

<p><big>Not only did they refuse to deny the right of the laity to preach and teach, they
also allowed and encouraged women to teach. This had tremendous shock effect on their
culture, at the same time that it probably tapped an hitherto unknown source of power.48
It would be easy to underestimate the impact that this feature had on the Europe of 1170.</big></p>

<p><big>It was after their excommunication that the Poor of Lyons' doctrine became
objectionable to the Roman Catholic Church. More than a hundred years later, it was said,</big></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>Among all the sects, there is none more pernicious to the Church than that of the
    leonists, and for three reasons: </big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>In the first place, because it is one of the most ancient; for some say that it
    dates back to the time of Sylvester; others to the time of the Apostles.</big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>In the second place, because it is the most widespread. There is hardly a country
    where it does not exist.</big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>In the third place, because, if other sects strike with horror those who listen to
    them, the Leonists, on the contrary, possess a great outward appearance of piety. As a
    matter of fact they lead irreproachable lives before men, and as regards their faith and
    the articles of their creed, they are orthodox.</big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><big>Their one conspicuous fault is, that they blaspheme against the Church and the
clergy, points on which laymen in general are known to be too easily led away.49</big></p>

<h2><a name="Doctrine">Doctrine</a> before the reformation</h2>

<p><big>Either in 1184 or in 1215 the Waldensians were excommunicated from the Roman
Catholic Church.50 We know that in 1184 the French bishops who were called to the Council
of Verona included them in the list of &quot;condemned movements.&quot; Further, in 1190
the Bishop of Narbonne pronounced a condemnation for heresy.51</big></p>

<p><big>As in the case of Luther, over 350 years later, the excommunication of Waldo
proved to be the occasion of increased theological polarization. Tourn argues that during
this period, Waldo was influenced by &quot;the Cathari, Pierre de Bruys, the monk Henri
and others.&quot;52 From these schismatics, they heard stiff criticism of the Roman
Catholic Church.</big></p>

<p><big>For the first time, the movement began to include radical protest in its views.
Clearly, there was a need to re-define their views on the sacraments, and other features
of ecclesiology, since they no longer had access to these &quot;means of grace&quot;
through the Church. Yet the shift seems to have been minimal, especially in the area of
soteriology. There was still no breakthrough in the area of salvation by grace. On the
other hand, all of the changes that did occur during this period were in the same
direction as later reform movements. </big></p>

<p><big>Adding momentum to change was the merger with some northern Italian splinter
groups. These groups heard in the preaching of the Poor of Lyons views that they already
held. Latourette says that the Waldensians were &quot;. . .joined by many of the
Humiliati, who had arisen in and near Milan and in that same year (1184) had come under
Papal prohibition. . . They criticized prayers in Latin on the ground that they were not
understood by the people, and derided church music and the canonical hours.&quot;53</big></p>

<p><big>These dissidents were established before the time of Waldo, and tended to have a
more communal ideal in their piety. They probably had the effect of stabilizing a movement
which was devoted to vagrancy by providing centers of agitation (this also made them easy
to locate, and therefore vulnerable). Milan had such a welcoming attitude that they
permitted the Waldensians to build their own house of prayer. This may have been the only
occasion on which they could openly have such a building for the next 300 years.</big></p>

<p><big>The Lombards, as the North Italian group was called, had many ideas of their own.
They were actually thrown out of the Waldensian movement in 1205 by Waldo, but later
re-joined. </big></p>

<p><big>Melia, who argues that the Waldensians were not Protestant in their doctrine, can
be counted on to refuse all exaggeration in the area of the Poor's evangelical beliefs. He
does admit (and documents each from more than one authentic Waldensian source) the
following listing of their divergent views during the period before the Hussite
revolution.</big></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>1. The Church of God has failed.</big></p>
    <p><big>2. The Holy Scriptures alone are sufficient to guide men to Salvation.</big></p>
    <p><big>3. The blessings and consecrations practiced in the Church do not confer any
    particular sanctity upon the things or persons blessed or consecrated.</big></p>
    <p><big>4. Catholic priests. . .have no authority; and the Pope of Rome is the chief of
    all heresiarchs.</big></p>
    <p><big>5. Everyone has the right to preach publicly the word of God</big></p>
    <p><big>6. Every oath is a mortal sin.54</big></p>
    <p><big>7. Purgatory is a dream, an invention of the sixth century. </big></p>
    <p><big>8. The indulgences of the Church are an invention of covetous Priests.</big></p>
    <p><big>9. There is no obligation to fast, nor to keep any holy day, Sunday excepted.</big></p>
    <p><big>10. The invocation of Saints cannot be admitted.</big></p>
    <p><big>11. Every honor given in the Church to the holy images of paintings, and to the
    relics of Saints is to be abolished.</big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><big>To this list, he adds doctrines that belong to the period between the Hussite
revolt and the Lutheran Revolution:</big></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>1. Auricular Confession is useless, and. . .it is enough to confess our sins to
    God.</big></p>
    <p><big>2. The definition of the church is, &quot;the whole of the elect from the
    beginning of the world to its end.&quot; and that regarding ministries, &quot;the holy
    Catholic Church is the congregation of all ministers and people obeying the Divine will,
    and by obedience united. . .&quot;</big></p>
    <p><big>3. It is necessary to receive the Eucharist under two kinds.55</big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><big>To these I would add,</big></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>1. The church and the state should remain as separate authorities.56</big></p>
    <p><big>2. The Eucharist is to be viewed as a memorial, not as a sacrifice.57</big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><big>It will be seen that every one of these doctrines are the natural outgrowth of
exclusion from the Roman Church. It was natural that the Poor of Lyons, feeling that they
had acted out of devotion to God from the beginning, would wonder whether denial of access
to the priestly functions of the Roman Church could alter their destiny. Especially with
the Bible in their own language, it was natural that they would re-examine these issues,
and ultimately deny Roman Catholic teaching in these areas. Therefore the rejection of
priestly function in the church was probably done in reaction to the action of the Roman
Church, rather than being a native sentiment of the movement.</big></p>

<p><big>Regarding the last point, on the Eucharist, it may be asked how the Waldensians
thought they would obtain salvation, since Roman Catholic doctrine has the grace of God
becoming effective through the sacraments. Here, it seems that no clear answer is
available. Apparently, the worshiper is to do his/her best to be good, and ask forgiveness
from God for the rest. There was also confession to a &quot;barba&quot; (&quot;uncle&quot;
or teacher-leader) and prayer on behalf of the penitent.58 Unfortunately, the grace aspect
of Huss' teaching seems to have been substantially lost on the Waldensians. </big></p>

<p><big>Given these tenets, there does not seem to be warrant for referring to &quot;two
reformations&quot; as does Amedo Molnar--the first being the Hussite and the Waldensian
movements, and the second, being the movements of the sixteenth century.59 At the same
time, it must be admitted that these two movements did make a substantial though
incomplete movement back toward the biblical model. The Waldensian movement was a
revolution based on radical ecclesiology, but without substantial change in soteriology.
Their contribution should not be disregarded any more than the Lutheran and Calvinists,
who continued to accept unbiblical doctrine in the area of eschatology and ecclesiology.</big></p>

<h2><a name="Growth">Growth</a> and Reaction</h2>

<p><big>During the thirty or so years between the excommunication of Waldo and the first
major genocidal crusade against them, the movement spread at an astonishing rate. There
were cells of activity right across southern Europe by the year 1208 when the crusade
against the Albigensians was proclaimed by Innocent III. </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>In this year there began a crusade against the Cathari60 akin to the one that had
    been going on against the Muslims for some time. This was the first time the crusade
    concept had been used against dissidents who called themselves Christian. &quot;For twenty
    long years Languedoc and Provence in France were subjected to a blood bath which not only
    wiped out the most advanced culture of the time but introduced it into the Church, and
    from there throughout the West, the rule that any ideological deviation must be crushed by
    force.&quot;61</big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><big>It is important to remember that this period (1150-1300) were the years of the
zenith of papal temporal power. Innocent III described himself as &quot;set between God
and man, lower than God but higher than man, who judges all and is judged by no one. .
.&quot;62 He declared that, &quot;the priesthood was as superior to the kingship as the
soul to the body,&quot; and he informed the nobles of Tuscany that, &quot;just as the moon
derives its light from the sun . . .so too the royal power derives the splendor of its
dignity from the pontifical authority.&quot;63 As has been the case so often in history,
greater political power for the institutional church has been bad news for Christian
minorities.</big></p>

<p><big>This was also the pattern that would characterize Roman Catholic reaction to the
Waldensians for the next 450 years. The history of the Waldensians during this period is
an incredible litany of genocidal disaster. This was the period of the inquisition in
Europe, and it is through the well kept records of the inquisition that we follow the
spread of the Waldensians movement throughout Europe. Tourn lists some of the major
persecutions after the crusade of 1208:</big></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>1. We know that at the beginning of the 14th century there were enough Poor
    remaining in France that the inquisitor Jacques Fournier, who later became Pope Benedict
    XII, undertook court trials against them.</big></p>
    <p><big>2. The transference of the papacy to Avignon in the middle of the 14th century was
    apparently the signal for a brutal repression against Waldensians in the Dauphine, for the
    beleaguered Pope was evidently not disposed to tolerate any expression of dissidence so
    near to his exiled see.</big></p>
    <p><big>3. In the year 1380. . . [a severe] round-up was begun under the inquisitors
    Martin of Prague and Peter Zwicker. These two were commissioned to bring to trial or to
    force the conversion of Waldensians through much of Europe. </big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>Their systematic effort began in Bavaria, continuing in the following year in the
    region of Erfurt, and in 1392 in the province of Brandenberg. The inquisitors then
    proceeded to Stettin, where they held a trial of 400 Waldensians. </big></p>
    <p><big>Their reports speak of activities in various cities of what are now Germany,
    Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and of their success in the city of Bern, Switzerland, in
    getting 130 suspects to abjure heresy and return to the Church's fold. They reported a
    similar success in Fribourg with some 50 Waldensians. </big></p>
    <p><big>4. . . .in the latter part of the century the inquisition was resumed in full
    intensity under the direction of a Franciscan, Francesco Borelli. So obsessed was this
    monk with his pursuit of heretics that it was said that every prison from Embrun to
    Avignon was full to overflowing. As a result, Pope Gregory IX himself had to appeal for
    alms for the hapless prisoners.</big></p>
    <p><big>5. . . . in 1450, the inquisitors were sent in to deal with Alpine dissidents. In
    that year the whole valley of Luserna was placed under interdiction on the charge of
    having resisted the authorities. </big></p>
    <p><big>6. Another inquisitorial sweep took place in 1475, including interminable court
    trials against anyone who failed to cooperate fully in the drive. . . .the counts of
    Luserna themselves were. . . charged with being too lenient toward the Waldensians--for
    which they were duly warned and subjected to heavy fines.</big></p>
    <p><big>7. . . .Charles I at last called for full scale military action against the
    dissidents, and was joined, from the French side, by the declaration of a crusade against
    the Waldensians which lasted from 1487-89. The latter was directed by the infamous papal
    legate, Alberta Cattaneo</big></p>
    <p><big>. . . There the governor of Savoy, with the full consent of Charles VIII of
    France, undertook a veritable and thorough going crusade against the hapless population.
    As in other places and times in the Middle Ages, it was under the patronage of the Pope
    and organized by his legate</big></p>
    <p><big>. . .[the village of] Pragelato found itself squarely in the path of the
    crusaders, so that it was invaded and sacked in the winter of 1487. A fate similar to that
    of Pragelato was in store for the Waldensians in the valleys of Argentieres and Vallouise.
    These folk had been consistently pacifist by tradition, so that they did not resist when
    the invaders came. The crusaders then proceeded to level their villages, destroying every
    trace of the Waldensians heritage.</big></p>
    <p><big>8. Francis I. . .in 1545 named the president of Aix's parliament personally to
    lead a papal army from Avignon to clear the area entirely of Waldensian presence. The
    Luberon folk were suddenly caught in a vise. </big></p>
    <p><big>. . .The mercenary soldiers engaged for the sweep did not stop until they had
    devastated the whole region and obliterated every trace of the Waldensian villages. A few
    survivors did manage to escape to Switzerland, but the lot of all the rest was either
    death by the sword or life sentences as galley-slaves on French ships. </big></p>
    <p><big>9. . . .On June 5, 1561, the town of San Sisto, with its 6,000 inhabitants, was
    burned to the ground. </big></p>
    <p><big>. . .Guardia Piemontese, its neighbor, was likewise destroyed. Prisoners were
    burned like torches, sold as slaves to the Moors or condemned to die of starvation in the
    dungeons of Cosenza. The massacre reached its height at Montalto Uffugo on June 11th. On
    the steps in front of the parish church, 88 Waldensians were slaughtered one by one, like
    animals brought to market.</big></p>
    <p><big>10. If the military operation lasted only a few weeks, the work of Catholic
    indoctrination, Jesuit style, continued for years. The Jesuits were determined to
    obliterate every evidence that Waldensians had been present in Calabria. They almost
    succeeded, except in one small respect: there is still a hint of the Provencal language in
    the daily speech of the inhabitants.64</big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><big>The list of atrocities goes on and on, in fact far too long for detailed
consideration here.65 The point that becomes clear is that every effort was made on
numerous occasions to eliminate the Poor of Lyons in the customary way. At various points
this policy was close to final success. Yet, the Waldensian movement was never eliminated.
</big></p>

<p><big>Another tactic that was employed briefly with success by Pope Innocent III was to
take advantage of the differences between Waldo and the Lombards in 1208 to win the Poor
Men back to the Church. Beginning in 1208 he encouraged the formation and spread of
Pauperes Catholici (&quot;Poor Catholics&quot;) who under ecclesiastical direction would
follow such of the practices of the Waldenses as the Church could approve. By this means
many who had been attracted by the Poor Men were held or won back.66</big></p>

<p><big>Nevertheless, the Waldensians continued to grow at a surprising rate. The pattern
of growth appears to have been the result of systematic underground discipleship and
witnessing.</big></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>. . .men and women, great and lesser, day and night do not cease to learn and

    been a student seven days, he seeks someone else to teach, as one curtain pulls another.
    Whoever excuses himself, saying that he is not able to learn, they say to him, &quot;Learn
    but one word each day, and after a year you will know three hundred, and you will
    progress.&quot;67 </big></p>

presence of Waldensian groups practicing their faith.69</big></p>

<p><a href="#Contents"><big>Return to the Table of Contents</big></a></p>

<h2><a name="Involvement">Involvement</a> with the Hussites</h2>

<p><big>When Jon Huss revolted against the authority of the Roman Catholic Church, it was
not another peasant revolt but a well reasoned attack aimed at the roots of papal
authority and doctrine. Huss was a scholar lecturing at the University of Prague. He
taught that the Bible was the sole authority for faith and practice, and salvation by
faith. He was promised safe conduct to the Council of Constance to answer for his views,
but was seized and burned at the stake anyway. At this point the population of sections of
modern Austria and Chechoslovakia rose in open revolt. </big></p>

<p><big>One new twist in this revolt was that some fought when attacked by the inevitable
papal army. In the same way that the Paulicians had earlier, they actually fought the
Roman Catholic Church to a standstill in the 1400's. The fortress that they later formed
at Tabor gave one group of them the name Taborites.</big></p>

<p><big>When word of this revolution reached the Waldensians, they reacted with
excitement. They promptly dispatched several &quot;barbas&quot; (&quot;uncles&quot;, the
term used by Waldensians for their teachers)70 to go to Bohemia and learn what was
happening. There followed a series of meetings between leaders of the two groups which led
to great benefit for the Waldensians. They received from the Hussite movement training in
theology which was to prove very helpful to future generations.</big></p>

<p><big>As a result, the barbas during this period were capable of reading theological
works in Latin, of studying mathematics, and knowing enough botany and rudimentary
medicine to permit them to deal with simple diseases. Their activity in ministerial tasks
likewise became more organized, rigorous and systematic than before. A young Waldensian
whose gifts and resolve marked him for service in the community would be apprenticed to an
experienced barba for a period of several years. After becoming familiar with the various
places to visit, learning languages and studying the Bible more deeply, the young barba
would then visit the different clandestine scholae or underground schools.71 </big></p>

<p><big>It is also interesting to note that although the Waldensians had almost always
been pacifist, on one occasion they raised money for the Bohemian war chest. On another
occasion, at Prali, a pitched battle between the local populace and the crusaders ended by
Count Hugo pulling back his troops.72</big></p>

<h2>The <a name="Reformation">Reformation</a></h2>

<p><big>Tourn states that, </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>Relentless inquisition, crusade and pillage had done their efficient work, so that
    by the end of the 15th century a veil of silence hung over much of the Waldensian world.73</big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><big>Yet the Waldensians still existed. By now, they were almost exclusively
concentrated in the Alpine valleys that had served as their main stronghold all along. </big></p>

<p><big>When the reformation erupted in 1517, the Waldensians were eager to join forces
with the new fellow-revolutionists. We know that as early as the year 1526, a general
assembly of Waldensians held at Laus, in the Chisone valley, was so eager to make personal
contact with the new movement that it made the decision to send a deputation across the
Alps.74</big></p>

<p><big>Luther, who so strongly denounced the Hussites at first, discovered during the
Liepzig Disputation that he agreed with Huss. Later he said &quot;We were all Hussites
without knowing it!&quot;75 Eventually, he wrote a preface to the Taborite Confession of
Faith, in which he referred to the Hussites as &quot;Waldensians&quot;.</big></p>

<p><big>No official ties were forged between the Waldensians and the other Protestant
Churches until 1532. In that year, the Synod of Chanforan was held, in which the
Waldensians became a part of the reformed Church based in Geneva. For the Reformed, Farel
led the negotiations, which were troubled, because of the Waldensian insistence on the
separation of church and state, as well as other doctrinal differences.76 The Swiss
reformers also called on the Waldensians to put an end to confessions, fasts and
&quot;meritorious Sundays,&quot; and to introduce an emphasis on the doctrine of
predestination.77</big></p>

<p><big>In the same year, the Geneva Reformers helped the Waldensians do a new translation
of the Bible. The task was entrusted to Olivetan, a relative of Calvin's, who retired
secretly to a village in the Alps to do his work. </big></p>

<p><big>The remarkable translation he produced (for which Calvin himself wrote the
Preface) has come to be known as the &quot;Olivetan Bible,&quot; the first of the French
Reformation. Printed in Neuchatel, it was delivered to the Waldensians in 1535.78</big></p>

<p><big>Many of their worst trials, including massacres, were still ahead of them in 1532,
but they were now a part of an international movement. Because they were no longer alone
as an isolated sect, and because their doctrine was essentially reformed, they pass beyond
the scope of this study.</big></p>

<h2><a name="Conclusions">Conclusions</a></h2>

<p><big>It is questionable whether the Waldensians ever exceeded 100,000 functional
members at any one time before the Reformation. Yet when one considers that they existed
in some force for almost 350 years before the reformation began, it is evident that many
generations, and therefore many times their total were affected.</big></p>

<p><big>No one knows, even roughly, the total number killed in the persecutions the
Waldensians endured, but the lowest estimates must run into the several tens of thousands.
It is unlikely that any group other than the Anabaptists and Jews can point to a
comparable history of prolonged universal persecution. Their amazing survival makes them
different, than the other schizmatic groups that began at the same time as well. The crime
which precipitated such suffering was their desire to exercise their birthright in the
Body of Christ according to the New Testament--the practice of their own gifts and
ministries</big></p>

<p><big>The Waldensian Church still exists today in several locations.79 Unfortunately,
the fusion with the Reformed Church has not resulted in the rapid ferment of outreach that
once characterized the movement. Nevertheless, the fact that they remain in existence at
all is a strong testimony, and perhaps a galling reminder to some, that the effort to
disenfranchise the laity from their right to minister will be frustrated by the power of
the Holy Spirit Himself. </big></p>

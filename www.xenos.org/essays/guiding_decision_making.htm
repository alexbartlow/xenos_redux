  Ministries</a></font></p>
<h3><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#008000" size="5">The 
  Need For Understanding The Decision Making Process</font></b></h3>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#008000"><b> </b></font> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Does your leadership 
    team get in needless (not to mention ungodly) squabbles when trying to make 
    decisions? Do you feel you are successful at facilitating change by building 
    consensus? Leading a home group largely entails making decisions, some with 
    large impact, and some less so. Here is a short list of some of the common 
    areas of decision making:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Home group structure 
        (what nights to meet, how frequently, what time, who to include in your 
        smaller equipping group [cell groups in Xenos], what Central Teaching 
        to go to, etc.) </font></p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">How should we proceed 
        in helping this person with this sin issue? How should we approach them? 
        What factors should we consider?</font></p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Home group activities 
        (retreats &#151; where should we go, what should we teach, focus on Christians 
        or non-Christians; should we do parties or a <i>Conversation &amp; Cuisine?</i>...)</font></p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What should our plant 
        plan look like? Who should go to what side?</font></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Who should follow-up 
        the new person? Who should disciple whom?</font></p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What should we teach 
        in home group? Cell group? </font></p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What should we discuss 
        during the leaders meeting? </font></p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Who are our next 
        leaders? Why them? When might they be ready? </font></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The list could go on 
    and on. Almost every action we take in our role as leaders is preceded by 
    a decision. And most decisions are made after discussion with our leadership 
    team and trainees who attend the meeting.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Sadly, in this context, 
    leadership teams often suffer conflict, disunity and relational damage. Too 
    often, opportunities for developing younger leaders or trainees are missed. 
    Leadership styles vary and there is no one right way to make decisions in 
    a corporate setting, but it is usually leaders who are too passive or too 
    authoritarian who contribute most to these problems. However, the rudiments 
    of good decision making and building consensus are not hard to learn.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">NOTE: These principles 
      work in other settings quite well too. For example, there are times where 
      including all of the workers in the home group in the decision is helpful 
      and beneficial to them. This simple approach can be applied to cell groups 
      and workers meetings just as well.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>WHY DO WE HAVE CONFLICT 
    OVER DECISIONS?</b> Our "self-life" often rears its ugly head when we are 
    confronted with a decision about which we have a strong opinion. We erroneously 
    believe if we are first to communicate our preference and rationale, then 
    we can bend others to our will. Depending on our communication skills and 
    personality, this might even &quot;work&quot;. But an opportunity for training 
    and developing unity has been lost, and so has the opportunity for the best 
    possible decision!</font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Qualifications:</font></b> 
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We must have a category 
        for allowing one person to make the quick and important decision when 
        time is of the absolute essence. These occurrences should be few and far 
        between, however; or you are likely dealing with someone who is too authoritarian 
        in their approach. The benefits of properly working through the decision-making 
        process usually far outweigh any harm done by delaying the decision (you 
        will slow the decision process when applying these principles properly).</font></p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Although consensus 
        or agreement on the final decision is preferable, it is not required or 
        always possible. Sometimes all the leaders will not be in agreement even 
        after appropriate discussion. In these instances, when a decision cannot 
        be put off any longer, Senior Leaders need to decide whose idea to go 
        with.</font></p>
    </li>
  </ol>

<h3><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#008000" size="4">The 
  Goal</font></b></h3>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#008000"><b> </b></font> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I propose a practical 
    model leaders can apply in diverse settings, which permits plenty of flexibility 
    for adapting to subtle nuances of individual situations. The goals are:</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Key Attitudes </font></b></p>
  <ul>
    <li> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The onus is on the 
        leader(s) to righteously consider all views. </font></p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The leaders should 
        willing to change from their view when possible. </font></p>
    </li>
    <li> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The passion or intensity 
      of communication should be guided by the importance of the decision. </font> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Ask yourself, &quot;Is 
          the area being discussed <b>moral or amoral</b>?&quot; This should be 
          one of the first considerations to determine the weight of the topic. 
          We don't treat non-moral areas with the same passion as moral ones, 
          although there are some amoral decisions that can have significant ramifications 
          on your group or an individual. </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Examples: </font></p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Amoral topic 
              #1: what book of the Bible to teach next in home group. Important 
              for certain yet not worth a passionate insistence on one direction.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Amoral topic 
              #2: what night of the week the home group should meet on. Important 
              and depending on what might be lost by choosing a particular night, 
              passion (not ungodliness) might need to be communicated and a particular 
              evening fought for (in a godly way). EG - in Xenos, we wouldn't 
              want a home group to meet on a Wednesday night because we hold fellowship-wide 
              classes that night. We don't want home group members to have to 
              decide between getting equipped and experiencing fellowship when 
              BOTH are biblical principles of New Testament community.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When consensus cannot 
      be reached, the senior leader has a particular responsibility to be willing 
      to put their own interests aside and consider others' preferences. Looking 
      back on the history of the group, the senior leader should see many instances 
      where they deferred to another person's preference even when feeling their 
      own idea was the best. Yet, there will also be times when leaders must be 
      willing to stand strong in their opinion, even when others disagree.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="5">Four Steps of the 
    Decision Making Process</font></b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b><font size="4" color="#800000" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">1) 
      Discuss what factors should be considered in this decision. </font></b> 
    </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It is much easier to 
      implement a decision when there is first a consensus (general agreement). 
      The process for building consensus on a leadership team (or any group setting) 
      usually, and ideally, <i>begins </i>with a discussion about the <b>factors</b> 
      that should be considered in making the decision. </font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Factors often include 
        theological precepts, principles, and logistic factors. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The senior and more 
        experienced leaders should use this first step as an opportunity to train 
        people in <i>how</i> to make decisions. Explain this process to them and 
        begin by telling them why you are discussing &quot;factors&quot; first. 
        Asking others what principles and factors should be considered and instructing 
        where necessary is fundamental to leadership training. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">If the people have 
      the opportunity to air their views on the factors, it does a lot to begin 
      to gel consensus and respectful communications. This pattern will be needed 
      later when each person gives his or her actual preferences (#3). Sadly, 
      many offer what decision they think should be made based on their first 
      inclination rather than following a comprehensive evaluation of all the 
      factors. Insufficient time spent on this first step can lead to disagreements 
      and other problems among the team. The senior and more outspoken leaders 
      should try to be the last to offer their input on what factors need to be 
      considered. In other words, in this step we DON'T discuss what decision 
      we think should be made regarding the issue - that is step 3.</font></p>
    <blockquote><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Some decisions 
      are also beneficial to bring to the attention of the other workers (non-leaders 
      or those in training). Start at the same spot by first discussing the factors. 
      In our structure, this can be done in cell groups (small men's and women's 
      bible studies that are a subset of the home group) or workers meetings (a 
      combined cell meeting). In these settings, you are trying to broaden the 
      base of consensus. You might be soliciting their opinions on something before 
      a decision needs to be made, or trying to explain a decision already made, 
      but educating them on the rationale.</font></blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">EXAMPLE:</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <ol start="2">
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The decision(s):

      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The factors that

      Finally it is time to give our opinions on what decision should be made</font></b></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Based on the above 
        agreements, it's time to give our opinion on what WE think the decision 
        should be.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In general, the more 
        experienced we are in leadership the better it is to let others speak 
        first. There is no race to get our opinion out; nothing to be afraid of 
        if someone thinks something different. We'll still get our turn and we 
        won't have "muddied the waters" by giving our opinion first. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As mentioned in the 
        attitudes, but worth remembering: We should have a track record of being 
        willing to defer to others' ideas and preferences. There will also be 
        those times where we have heard and considered others' views, but still 
        need to go with our opinion.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">EXAMPLE:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">You agreed your 
          group needed evangelism more than anything else &#151; so your topic 
          is limited to topics non-Christians would be most interested in. Challenging 
          the Christians in your group would not be a priority although not ignored.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">You have a lot 
          of young children whose parents are in the group. The number and length 
          of teachings, start times and gaps between teachings will need to take 
          into consideration several factors: how long baby-sitters can stay, 
          the need for parents to touch base with their kids for an hour or so 
          between teachings, time to prep food, etc.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">You have three 
          experienced and gifted teachers. Therefore they are requested to prepare 
          and teach on the topic of choice.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The decisions and 
          planning become much easier to agree upon when the primary goals and 
          concerns affecting that decision have been agreed upon first.</font></p>

      Decision-making time!</font></b></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">At this point, often 
        the decision is obvious and most, if not all the leaders are in agreement. 
        If there is a Senior Leader of the leadership team, he or she would probably 
        speak up at this point and communicate the obvious. But...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>"What! You still 
        can't agree?" </b></font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">If there is not 
          consensus at this point, you need to decide how time-sensitive the decision 
          is. Often, the bigger the decision, the better to give people time to 
          consider the discussion and pray about it. You always can return another 
          day to revisit the subject. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">However, once the 
          point is reached when a decision must be made, the senior leader has 
          the responsibility to weigh all the opinions and decide.</font></p>

<h3><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#008000" size="5">Conclusion</font></b></h3>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#008000"><b> </b></font> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The example used was 
    an obviously non-moral situation, yet typical of those that can lead to unity 
    problems. This approach works as well for more difficult issues like how to 
    help brothers or sisters who are in sin. As mentioned, this approach is also 
    effective in leading cell groups or workers meetings, even if you are explaining 
    a decision the leaders already have made.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The repeated theme in 
    the Bible is the explanation of <i>why</i> we do what God commands us to do. 
    He accomplishes this by coupling imperatives (his commands) with indicatives 
    (a description of what he has done, is doing, or will do). In the same way, 
    this approach enables us to clarify and train others about the reasons behind 
    the decisions. Doing this results in decisions reflecting sound judgment, 
    and helps leadership teams grow in unity and wisdom through their experience.</font></p>

</font><b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><p ALIGN="center">Recognizing Emotional Disorders</p>
</b></font><font SIZE="3">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b><p>SIX DIAGNOSTIC CATEGORIES</p>

<ul>
</b><font FACE="Arial"><li>Affective Disorders, (Unipolar and Bipolar) 
  
<li>Schizophrenia, (psychosis) 
  
<li>Anxiety Disorders, (Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, OCD) 
  
<li>Personality Disorders 
  
<li>Substance Abuse Disorders 
  
<li>Eating Disorders</li></ul>

</font><font SIZE="3">
</font><b><font FACE="Arial"><p>Affective Disorders</p>
</b></font><p><strong>Major Depression</strong> </p>
<font SIZE="3"><p>In order to merit this diagnosis, a person must have at 
least five of the following symptoms nearly every day for at least two weeks:  Sad mood, tearfulness, psychomotor retardation, decreased energy, diminished interest or pleasure, insomnia, poor appetite, weight loss, poor concentration, feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, or excessive guilt, and suicidal ideation.</p>

<p>This is the most common type of major depression. 
However, there is also an atypical type of major depression where individuals' 
experience increased<em> </em> sleep and appetite, rather than decreased.</p>

</font><p><strong>Dysthmic Disorder</strong> </p>
<font SIZE="3"><p>If a person has experienced a depressed mood more days 
than not for the past two years and has at least two<em> </em> of the previously mentioned symptoms, they likely have what is called a DYSTHMIC</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> </font><font SIZE="3">DISORDER. This is a chronic low level depression and is not 
considered a Major Affective disorder, and yet people with a dysthmic disorder 
may benefit from anti-depressant medication.</p>

</font><p><strong>Bipolar Disorder</strong> </p>
<font SIZE="3"><p>Both of these disorders are considered Unipolar mood 
disorders because there is only one direction the mood tends to swing to. The 
other type of Major Affective Disorder is called Bipolar Disorder because the 
persons' mood tends to swing in two directions, (thus it is called Bi because of 
the two poles). Major Depression and Bipolar Disorder are differentiated by 
whether or not an individual has ever had a manic episode. The person with a 
major depressive illness has recurrent depressive episodes throughout their 
life, whereas the Bipolar patient, or Manic Depressive as they once were called, 
have periodic depressive episodes and<em> </em> have had at least one manic episode in their lifetime.</p>


<ul>

<ul><li><strong>Definition of a Manic Episode: </strong>One 
    or more distinct periods, (few days-weeks), with a predominantly elevated, 
    explosive or irritable mood, and at least three of the following symptoms: 
    increase in activity or physical restlessness, more talkative--difficult to 
    interrupt, jumping from one topic to another very rapidly, (flight of ideas 
    or loose associations), inflated self-esteem, (delusions of grandeur), 
    decreased need for sleep, (can stay up for 3-4 nights cleaning etc.), easily 
    distracted, excessive involvement in activities with a high potential for 
    painful consequences--like buying sprees, foolish business investments, or 
    sexual indiscretions, i.e., poor judgment.</li></ul>
</ul>



<ul>

<ul>
<li>People with a Bipolar Disorder may even become 
    psychotic during a manic episode. In other words, they may lose touch with 
    reality. They may hallucinate or experience delusions.</li></ul>
</ul>



<ul>

<ul><li><strong>Definition of a Delusion</strong>: A &quot;fixed 
    false belief which no amount of objective evidence will 
change.&quot;</li></ul>
</ul>


</font><b><font FACE="Arial"><p>Schizophrenic Disorders</p>
</b></font><font SIZE="3"><p>These individuals are usually quite ill. This is 
considered a psychotic disorder. In other words they are out of touch with 
reality. They experience delusions and or hallucinations.  We have already discussed delusions.</p>

<ul>

<ul><li><strong>Definition of a Hallucination</strong>: A 
    false sensory perception in the absence of any external stimuli, not merely 
    a misinterpretation of something that is really there, (i.e., not an 
    illusion).</li></ul>
</ul>


<ul>

<ul>
<li>Most common auditory hallucination</li></ul>
</ul>


<ul>

<ul>
<li>Disorders of thinking</li></ul>
</ul>


<ul>

<ul>
<li>Loose associations or flight of ideas</li></ul>
</ul>


</font><b><font FACE="Arial"><p>Anxiety Disorders</p>
</b></font><font SIZE="3"><p>The predominant symptom in this group of disorders is 
obviously anxiety. These folks are considered neurotic, not psychotic because 
they are in touch with reality.</p>

<p>This category includes:</p>
<p>Panic Disorders with or without Agoraphobia, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Social Phobia, PTSD, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder.</p>

<ul>

<ul><li><strong>Panic Disorders </strong>consist of sudden 
    distinct episodes of extreme anxiety which include four or more of the 
    following symptoms: Shortness of breath, heart palpitations, chest pain, 
    dizziness, sweating, shaking, or a fear of loosing control or dying. These 
    individuals may also have agoraphobia and are afraid to leave their homes. 
    Agoraphobia means literally fear of open spaces.  These people often find it very difficult to be in a crowd.  For example they may get overwhelmed and experience a panic attack in a grocery store.<br></li></ul>
</ul>


<ul>

<ul><li><strong>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder </strong> 
    is characterized by recurrent obsessions or intrusive, unwanted thoughts, 
    or compulsions, which are repetitive behaviors or mental acts which the 
    person feels driven to perform in response to and obsession or according to 
    certain rules or rituals. The individual realizes these thoughts or actions 
    are abnormal or excessive, but&nbsp;feels unable to control them. They are a significant 
    source of distress to the individual or interfere with social functioning. 
    In other words, these are more than merely excessive worries about real life 
    problems.</li></ul>
</ul>


</font><b><font FACE="Arial"><p>Personality Disorders</p>
</b></font><font SIZE="3"><p>We all have certain personality traits that we have 
developed over the years. These are enduring, ingrained patterns of perceiving 
and relating to the environment and ourselves. When these personality traits 
become inflexible and maladaptive and cause either significant impairment in 
social or occupational functioning they constitute a personality disorder. Examples include:</p>

<ul>  
  
<li>Narcissistic, Paranoid, Avoidant, Dependent, Anti-social, Histrionic, Schizoid, Passive-Aggressive, and Borderline Personality Disorder.</li></ul>


</font><b><font FACE="Arial"><p>Substance Abuse</p>
</b></font><font SIZE="3">
<p>A pattern of pathologic use involves intoxication throughout the day, the 
inability to stop or cut down, or black outs.The difference between alcohol or 
substance abuse verses dependence is that someone has become dependent if they 
have developed tolerance or withdrawal symptoms. Tolerance is the need for 
markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieve intoxication. Withdrawal 
symptoms include tremor, nausea, agitation and seizures.</p>
<p>It is also important to determine if they have had to 
miss work because of their abuse and if they have had any legal problems, such 
as an OMVI.</p>

</font><b><font FACE="Arial"><p>Eating Disorders</p>
</b></font><p><strong>Anorexia</strong></p><font SIZE="3"><p>Intense fear of getting fat</p>
<p>Disturbance of body image - Think they are fat even when thinWeight loss of 
at least 25% of original body weight</p>
<p>Refusal to maintain body weight over a minimal normal weight for age and 
heightNo known physical illness that would account for weight 
lossAmenorrhea</p></font><p><strong>Bulimia</strong></p>
<font SIZE="3"><p>Recurrent episodes of binge eating - rapid consumption of large amounts of food in a discrete period of time, and a sense of lack of control over eating, (often eat in secret)</p>
<p>Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior in order to prevent weight 
gain, such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, fasting or excessive 
exerciseThe binge eating and compensatory behavior both occur at least twice a 
week for 3 months</p>
<p>Preoccupation with weight and shapeNot due to any physical 
disorder</p>

</font><b><font FACE="Arial"><p>When to refer</p>
</b></font><font SIZE="3"><p>The <strong>RED FLAGS </strong>to look for in discerning 
if someone needs professional help are:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Suicidal Ideation</strong>  
  
<p>This must be asked directly if you suspect someone may 
  have thoughts about hurting themself. It's important to get them to verbalize 
  these thoughts, since they are less likely to act on them if they talk about 
  it. Ask them if they have thought of a plan. Also ask them if they've ever had 
  these thoughts before or ever made a suicide attempt in the past. If they say 
  I wish I were dead, this is not taken nearly as seriously as if they say I'm 
  thinking about taking an overdose. If they have a plan it must be taken seriously and you should take them to Harding Emergency Services, Riverside E.R., or a Community Mental Health Center.</p>
<li><strong>Need for Medication</strong>   
  
<p>If an individual is psychotic, significantly depressed, 
  or experiencing O.C.D., they ought to be referred for an evaluation by a 
  psychiatrist in order to determine if they need medication. Individuals with 
  symptoms of Major Depression, Bipolar Disorder, and in some cases Dysthymic 
  Disorder will likely need anti-depressant medication.</p>
<p>People with O.C.D., Panic Disorder with or without 
  agoraphobia may benefit from medication.</p>
<p>Obviously those with a schizophrenic illness will need 
  an anti-psychotic.</p>

<li><strong>Need Hospitalization</strong><p>If suicidal or homicidal they need to be admitted. 
  These days that is about the only way to get someone admitted to the hospital. 
  If they are psychotic and unable to care for themselves then they may also be 
  admitted.</p>

<li><strong>Need for Detox</strong>  </li></ol>

<p>If they are dependent on drugs or alcohol they may need 
to be hospitalized in order to be detoxed. This is because if someone who is 
dependent on alcohol stops drinking cold turkey they are at risk for withdrawal 
seizures.  In the hospital their vital signs can be monitored closely and they can be administered medication which can prevent withdrawal seizures.</p>

</font><b><p>CONCLUSION</p>
</b><font SIZE="3"><p>It is helpful to look at hurting people in terms of these 
types of symptoms. If you suspect someone is depressed, for example, you may 
want to inquire about their sleeping and eating patterns in order to assess the 
severity of their depression. It is also crucial to ask if they have had any 
thoughts about suicide.  If so, ask if they have a plan or a history of attempts.</p>
<p>If you are living in a ministry house and you notice food continues to 
disappear, you may have a bulimic living among you. You will need to directly 
confront them about their binging and purging, since secrecy is paramount to the 
bulimic and openness is key to their recovery.Obviously if someone becomes 
delusional or begins hearing voices, you would want them evaluated as soon as 
possible.Your job as leaders is to encourage them to see a professional. You can 
take them to Riverside's E.R. (566-5000), Harding Hospital Emergency Services 
(785-7400), or a Community Mental Health Center such as North Central on High 
Street just south of Campus. You could try to contact me or Dr. Larry Pfahler, 
who is a Christian psychiatrist in Worthington and has a practice called Alpha 
Psychiatric Care with several psychologists and social workers.</p>

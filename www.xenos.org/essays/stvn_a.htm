<h3 class="style1">Introduction</h3>
<p class="style1">The defense offered by Steven in Acts 7 has confused interpreters as much as any
  passage in the book of Acts. In his excellent commentary on Acts, Howard Marshal says, </p>
<p class="style1">. . . the purpose of this speech is still much disputed. In form it is a lengthy
  recital of Old Testament history, discussing in detail what appear to be insignificant
  points and culminating in a bitter attack on the speaker's hearers. What is the speaker
  trying to do?&quot; 1 </p>
<p class="style1">later he complains, </p>
<p class="style1">. . .it is not clear what the theological point of the details is.&quot; 2 </p>
<p class="style1">These are striking statements, coming, as they do, from one who demonstrates keen
  insight throughout the text of Acts. Yet, they are hardly unusual. Dibelius is much
  stronger,The irrelevance of this speech has for long been the real problem of exegesis. It
  is, indeed, impossible to find a connection between the account of the history of Israel
  to the time of Moses (7:2-19) and the accusations against Stephen. . .The major part of
  the speech shows no purpose whatever. . . </p>
<p class="style1">and finally, </p>
<p class="style1">The most striking feature of this speech is the irrelevance of its main section.3 </p>
<p class="style1">Gealy asks, &quot;. . . How are we to explain the fact that Steven does not really
  speak to the charges brought against him?&quot;4 In fact, Gealy thinks that the whole text
  is so unrelated to the flow of the Steven narrative that 7:1-53 must be one of three
  conflated traditions, namely &quot;an anti-Jewish polemic which Luke fashioned into a
  speech for his purposes.&quot;5 He thinks that the only point made in the speech is that
  the history of Israel is &quot;a history of continual disobedience to God&quot;.6 </p>
<p class="style1">Unfortunately, Gealy has missed the point of this brilliant speech. The speech is
  certainly not anti-semitic,7 and the fact that Israel was disobedient to the law, though
  mentioned, plays a subordinate role in the thought development. It is only certain kinds
  of disobedience that Stephen focuses on. In fact, this speech is the lynch-pin in the
  transition between Christianity as a localized ethnic religion, and a universal body.8
  Stephen the Hellenist was able to see the implications of the Gospel to an extraordinary
  degree. 9 </p>
<p class="style1">While there are confusing sections in the speech, there are also sections that are well
  understood by modern interpreters. Commonly accepted motifs are: 
<ol class="style1">
  <li>The history of Israel demonstrates ineptitude (on the part of the leadership especially)
    in seeing the hand of God and in recognizing His agents. </li>
  <li>The Temple cultus has been misinterpreted all along, and should now be set aside.
    10These motifs are clearly argued in this speech. This author has no objection to either
    application. On the other hand, there must be more involved in the argument, because much
    of the detailed material in the speech does not address these two points. There is still a
    substantial body of detailed Old Testament material not included in the argument for these
    two obvious points. It is this extra material (some of it strange), that is the focus of
    this study. </li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 class="style1">The Missing Message</h3>
<p class="style1">The key to understanding the inclusion of seemingly irrelevant detail in Stephen's
  speech is to realize that they deal with geography. The speech is overly concerned with
  geography, and with the people's and God's relationship to it. </p>
<p class="style1">It is the argument of this paper that a mistake is being made by interpreters when the
  second purpose of Stephen's speech is limited to answering charges regarding the temple.
  The nucleus of the thinking here is not only a response to the temple, but to the broader
  and more foundational concept of sacred space or sacred land.11 Stephen will argue that
  the notion of sacred land, used by God in the past for communication purposes, was not,
  and should not be viewed as a limitation upon Him. &quot;God can work just fine without
  the use of any sacred space,&quot; is Stephen's argument. </p>
<p class="style1">Only this broader understanding will account for all of the material in the speech, as
  well as explaining the strategy Stephen follows in refuting the charges made against him.
  One of the charges brought against Stephen was that he speaks against, &quot;this
  place,&quot; (6:13).12 Marshal thinks that the accusation that Stephen blasphemed
  &quot;this holy place&quot; (tou hagiou topou toutou vs.14) is a reference to the temple.
  This may be correct, even though the examples he cites do not use the word topos, but
  naos.13 </p>
<p class="style1">Whether the phrase refers exclusively to the temple, or to the sacred area around it
  (Jerusalem, Mt. Zion or even Israel) it seems clear that the greater question of sacred
  space in the sense of sacred land had come up in the debate earlier.14It would be hard to
  exaggerate the centrality of the sacred land of Israel in the understanding of the
  covenantal blessings at the heart of Judaism at this time.15 At the heart of
  ethnic-religious world views are the twin values of &quot;Race and Space,&quot; or to put
  it differently, &quot;Blood and Soil.&quot; </p>
<p class="style1">These values are hardly unique to first century Judaism. The same terms have been used
  to understand thought systems such as Naziism. Unfortunately, they would adequately
  summarize the ethos of much of modern western Christianity. These values can be dangerous
  substitutes for real spirituality, and may stand as barriers to a truly universal, loving,
  outreaching, and caring form of Christianity. Most of the book of Acts is concerned with
  God's efforts to overcome the inertia that emanates from the unbalanced application of
  these two values in the name of religion. </p>
<p class="style1">By speaking to the issue of sacred space, including the sacred city and sacred land of
  Israel, Stephen's speech lays a firm ideological foundation for the subsequent movement of
  the focus of God's work away from both in the following chapters. Immediately, we find
  Philip putting into action the lateral movement that Stephen's analysis of Scripture so
  beautifully justified. </p>
<p class="style1">Having asserted this theme, we can now briefly note how it is developed in the text of
  Stephen's speech.</p>
<h3 class="style1">Abraham (vs. 2-8)</h3>
<p class="style1">That God related personally to Abraham was admitted by all. The important point to
  Steven is that He did so, &quot;. . .while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he lived in
  Haran.&quot; (Acts 7:2). Indeed, He directed him to &quot;Leave your country and your
  people. . .&quot; (7:3), just as He would now direct the righteous of Israel to leave
  their country and their people for the sake of world-wide witness. Stephen admits that
  Abraham was directed to &quot;this land&quot; (tain gain tautain), but reminds them that
  he never owned a foot of ground in it (vs.5).16 Thus, Abraham was a foreigner in the
  promised land, just as many of the Hellenists and some Gentiles were. </p>
<p class="style1">One might be tempted at this point to argue that this state was hardly God's way, since
  the promise was still unfulfilled. But Stephen reminds them that even after the birth of
  Isaac, &quot;Your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own. . .&quot; for
  400 years (vs. 6). Only then would they come out of that country to serve God in
  &quot;this place&quot; (en toi topoi toutoi).17 </p>
<p class="style1">The significance of the mention of circumcision in this context is that the covenant
  was being practiced while no land was owned by Abraham, thus showing that the enjoyment of
  this covenant was not dependent on being a native of the Holy Land.18</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="style1">The Patriarchs (vs. 8-19)</h3>
<p class="style1">The career of the patriarchs continues to demonstrate the key motifs that interest
  Stephen. First, they did not recognize that God was with Joseph, so they sold him.19 In
  the same way, the present august assembly (though certainly no greater in stature than the
  patriarchs themselves) may have failed to recognize God's agent again in Christ. </p>
<p class="style1">This part of the argument is clear. However, why include the career of Joseph during
  the famine? To Stephen, the important thing is not that Joseph was sold into slavery, but
  that he was sold into slavery &quot;in Egypt,&quot; (vs. 9). Did this mean that because
  Joseph was out of the land, he was out of the center of action spiritually? Not at all. In
  fact, the center of action moved with Joseph. &quot;God was with him,&quot; affirms
  Stephen (vs. 9). </p>
<p class="style1">The subsequent events surrounding the famine demonstrated that God was working through
  Joseph the outcast one, an Egyptian slave living outside of Israel. Indeed, God was
  working so effectively through Joseph that the entire family eventually moved to Egypt,
  and the focus of salvation history during this period shifted completely out of the
  promised land. </p>
<p class="style1">It is true that though Joseph and Jacob died in Egypt, their bodies were brought back
  to Palestine. Yet, according to Stephen, it was to the city of Shechem that they were
  taken, in the hated territory of the Samaritans.20 </p>
<hr>
<h3 class="style1">Moses (vs. 19-43)</h3>
<p class="style1">Blasphemy of Moses was part of the charge brought against Stephen, so his analysis of
  this period in salvation history is important. The elements of the story included by
  Stephen focus on: 
<ol class="style1">
  <li>Moses' relation to other races (vs. 21-23) </li>
  <li>The failure on the part of the people (including the leadership) to recognize him, or to
    obey his teaching (vs. 24-28,35,37-39) see esp. vs. 25, he &quot;thought that his own
    people would realize that God was using him to rescue them, but they did not. and 37
    &quot;But our fathers refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him. . .&quot;21 </li>
  <li>Moses' and the people's relation to sacred space The last point, regarding sacred space,
    accounts for the seemingly strange and unnecessary material in this section. First we find
    that Moses &quot;fled to Midian, where he settled as a foreigner,&quot; (vs. 29). It was
    in Midian, not in Palestine, that he saw the burning bush. It was on an unknown patch of
    ground somewhere near Sinai that God said, &quot;Take off your sandals; the place where
    you are standing is holy ground,&quot; (vs. 33). Here was authentic sacred ground if ever
    there was such a thing! </li>
</ol>
<p class="style1">Yet, interestingly, no one in Stephen's day knew where this ground was. Would it be a
  good idea to look for the spot in the hope that it was still sacred? Not at all. The thing
  that made it sacred was the presence of God working there. Now that He had moved on to
  other work, the location of the spot was unimportant. </p>
<p class="style1">It would have been a serious mistake to stand around at this site when God had already
  moved on! In the same way, according to Stephen, God was moving in new directions as he
  spoke, but He was being inhibited by institutionalized foot-dragging on the part of his
  audience. </p>
<p class="style1">Stephen not only points out that Moses did wonders, but he reminds his audience of the
  venue for those works-- &quot;in Egypt, at the Red Sea and for forty years in the
  desert,&quot; (vs. 36). </p>
<p class="style1">The passage in 40-43 reporting on the practice of idol worship in the wilderness has
  confused many. Why should Stephen pick out this area of sin to report on? Surely there
  were ample examples of unfaithfulness to the law in Deuteronomy, without having to go to
  the book of Psalms? The answer, I suggest is that this passage is also dealing with the
  issue of sacred space.22 </p>
<p class="style1">Stephen shows that the inclination of the people has always been to worship and love
  &quot;the work of their own hands,&quot; (vs. 41). It was the fact that the animistic gods
  were tangible, visible and man-made that appealed to the ancient Hebrews, and the same
  features, he suggests, commended the temple and the sacred ground idea to his audience. </p>
<hr>
<p><span class="style1"><a href="chhist.htm"></a></span></p>
<h3 class="style1">The Tabernacle and the Temple (Vs. 44-50)</h3>
<p class="style1">Stephen illustrates the basic difference between the outlook of man and that of God on
  this point, by comparing the tabernacle and the temple (vs.44-50). The tabernacle hardly
  fits the usual pattern for sacred space. Shrines and temples are usually built around the
  site of a theophany.23 A sacred grove, spring, mountain, or stone are the proper loci for
  religious shrines. But this shrine was mobile. The sacredness of the shrine had to do with
  the &quot;pattern he [Moses] had seen,&quot; (vs.44) and the teaching value that resulted,
  not with its location. </p>
<p class="style1">Not only this, but the tabernacle sat in the barnyard of a farmer for a period of time
  that must have been about 400 years according to the chronology of I Kings.24 During this
  whole time--almost equal in length to the whole post-exilic history of Jerusalem--the
  location of the temple was irrelevant to God's working. Certainly the space Stephen
  devoted to the history of the tabernacle must relate to the over-all theme of the speech.
  The best guess as to the significant aspect of the tabernacle is the absence of any tie to
  a geographical location. </p>
<p class="style1">It is possible that God's refusal to let David build the temple, in spite of the fact
  that he was even more favored by God than Solomon, is used to show that the temple was not
  God's ideal. Certainly, in the original speech, Stephen cannot have failed to teach on the
  great text in II Sam. 7 where God declares that He has, &quot;been moving around in a
  tent, even in a tabernacle.&quot; God goes on to ask, &quot;Did I [ask] why have you not
  built Me a house of cedar?&quot;25 </p>
<p class="style1">This need not be seen as an argument that the construction of the temple was a mistake.
  It was not the construction of the temple that was an error, but the false interpretation
  of the temple that had become a deadly error.26 No doubt, it was this danger that caused
  God to reflect some negativity regarding the whole project. Yet, there is no actual
  statement to the effect that God had not ordained the temple. Rather, there is the
  unwavering declaration that &quot;the Most High does not dwell in houses made by human
  hands.&quot; (vs. 48). </p>
<p class="style1">This was the critical misunderstanding that was inhibiting God's purposes in Stephen's
  day, as it still does today. </p>
<p class="style1">Stephen seems to have realized that he had already signed his death warrant by directly
  opposing the theology of the Counsel. He certainly evidences no effort at restraint in the
  denunciation that follows.27 Stephen's Death and Legacy </p>
<p class="style1">I think entirely too much importance is attached to Stephen's reference to Christ as
  the &quot;Son of Man&quot;. The fact that this is the only usage of the term outside of
  the gospels is accounted for by the unique nature of the confrontation, including the fact
  that the audience is made up of Jewish Old Testament scholars. The allusion to Dan. 7:14
  seems natural and realistic in this setting. It is certainly not what makes the speech
  important.28 </p>
<p class="style1">The fact that the counsel stoned Stephen without Roman approval is an evident breech of
  Roman law, even if the crimes of blasphemy were capitol offenses. Bruce is probably
  correct when he observes that, </p>
<blockquote class="style1">
  <p>. . .during the closing part of Pilate's administration, especially when he was
    resident in Caesarea, the Jewish rulers knew that they could take certain discreet
    liberties.29 </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style1">It remains possible in this author's mind that the counsel simply functioned as an
  illegal lynch mob.30 The main point is that the church lost a great light the day that
  Stephen died. Stephen was ahead of the development of many of the other leaders in the
  Jerusalem church in his understanding of the relationship of the gospel to the issues of
  race, sacred space, and the radical change in God's program with respect to the Old
  Testament.31 Indeed, it was Philip the evangelist, another apparent Hellenist, who in Acts
  8, opens the door to Samaritans, and to the Ethiopian Eunich. </p>
<p class="style1">It must have seemed like an unmitigated tragedy to have lost a visionary who understood
  better than most of the Apostles at this time some of the most basic aspects of Christian
  spirituality. Yet, the narrative indicates that God was at work, even though the believers
  there would not have known it at the time. The cloaks were laid at the feet of one who
  would later demonstrate every bit as much radicalism as Stephen--Saul of Tarsus.32</p>

<p class="style1">9On the identity of what are called &quot;Hellenistai&quot; in vs. 1, see F. F. Bruce, <i>New
  Testament History</i>, (Garden City, NY: Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc., 1980), p. 219,
  &quot;That they [the hellenists] maintained a more liberal outlook than the `Hebrews',
  including the apostles, is evident from the sequel to the narrative of their
  election.&quot; </p>
<p class="style1">Some more radical critics think that the &quot;Hellenists&quot; were a splinter group
  in Judaism before the time of Christ. Their &quot;anti-temple, anti-ritualistic bias seems
  clear from Stephen's speech,&quot; comments Trudinger in what appears to be a circular
  argument. See Paul Trudinger, &quot;Stephen and the Life of the Primitive Church&quot; in <i>Biblical
    Theology Bulletin</i>, Vol. 14 No. 1 (Jan. 1984), p. 19. There is little doubt that there
  were more liberally minded Jews known as Hellenists, but it is not clear that they were
  against the Temple or ritual. The only extra-biblical evidence adduced is an alleged
  similarity to the spirit of the Qumran community. The parallels, however, appear
  superficial. </p>
<p class="style1">10Gealy is convinced wrongly that Stephen thinks there never should have been a temple.
  F. D. Gealy, &quot;Steven,&quot; in <i>The Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible</i>, p.
  442. But for a more balanced appraisal see, F. F. Bruce, <i>New Testament History</i>,
  (Garden City, NY: Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc., 1980), p. 223.11 Longnecker follows a
  very similar line on Acts 7 in his exceptional commentary in the Expositors series.
  However, he does not relate to the sacred space notion, only to the area of sacred land.

    Commentary</i>, Gabelein, Frank, E., Editor. </p>
<p class="style1">12See Doble's interesting claim that &quot;hramata&quot; (speak against 6:13) means to
  &quot;utter oracles against&quot;. This may be a reference to Stephen's quoting Jesus'
  oracles against the temple in Lk. 19:41. P. Doble, &quot;The Son of Man Saying in
  Stephen's Witnessing: Acts 6:8-8:2,&quot; in <i>New Testament Studies</i>, Vol. 31 (1985).
  p. 69 see fn.14. </p>
<p class="style1">13Mk. 14:58, 15:29, Jn. 2:19 all use naos, but Marshall cites them to demonstrated that
  the phrase &quot;tou hagiou topou toutou&quot; means temple. Howard I. Marshall, <i>The
    Acts of the Apostles</i>, p. 129. Knowling thinks the phrase could be referring also to
  the assembly place of the Sanhedrin, also on the temple mount. R. J. Knowling, &quot;The
  Acts of the Apostles.&quot; in <i>The Expositor's Bible Commentary</i>, Frank, E.
  Gabelein, Editor, (Grand Rapids MI.: Zondervan Publishing House, 1978), Vol. II p. 177. </p>
<p class="style1">14The phrase &quot;ho topos toutos&quot; (this place) is found exclusively in Luke-Acts
  in the New Testament, (sometimes in other cases). Once it is found in and Luke (16:28),
  and five times in Acts (6:13,14; 7:7; 21:28 twice). In 7:7 it is clearly referring to the
  land of Israel (see below). In 6:13,14 it is likely that the first reference may refer to
  the land of Israel, and in 21:28 it is also possible that the first usage refers to the
  land rather than the temple. Only when &quot;hagiou&quot; is inserted does it become
  likely that the temple is being referred to exclusively, and even then there is room for
  doubt as noted above in note 13. Also see Knowling for a brief explanation of the textual
  problem with this phrase in vs. 13. R. J. Knowling, &quot;The Acts of the Apostles.&quot;
  in <i>The Expositor's Bible Commentary</i>, Vol. II p. 177. The variant does not affect
  the sense of the charge against Stephen. </p>
<p class="style1">15Concerning the New and Old Testament's views of the land of Israel, Brown notes,
  &quot;One of the most striking differences between the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament.
  . .is the centrality of the Land in the Hebrew Bible and the apparent indifference to it
  in much of the New Testament.&quot; Wesley H. Brown, &quot;Christian Understandings of
  Biblical Prophecy, Israel and the Land, and the Christian-Jewish Encounter,&quot; in <i>Immanuel</i>,
  No. 18. p. 87. He also cites W. D. Davies' work <i>The Gospel and the Land</i>,
  &quot;Christ has become for Paul the `locus' of redemption. . .once he had seen in Jesus
  his Torah, he had in principle broken with the land. . .His geographical identity was
  subordinated to that of being `in Christ'. . .&quot; p. 88. </p>
<p class="style1">See Davies further for documentation on Jewish reverence for the sacredness of the
  land. W. D. Davies, <i>The Gospel and the Land</i>, (Berkeley: University of California
  Press, 1974), pp. 1-160. </p>
<p class="style1">Also see Richard N. Longnecker, &quot;The Acts of the Apostles,&quot; p. 339. </p>
<p class="style1">16On the chronological problem regarding the death of Terah see Howard I. Marshall, <i>The
  Acts of the Apostles</i>, p. 135. </p>
<p class="style1">17Gen. 15:13,14 Abraham was apparently standing near the Oaks of Mamre when God said
  this. This would be near Hebron, well outside of the site of Jerusalem, but within the
  land of Israel.18Similarly, Howard I. Marshall, <i>The Acts of the Apostles</i>, p.
  137.19The jealousy evident in the patriarchs was also the driving force behind the
  persecution of Jesus according to all of the Gospel authors.20Howard I. Marshall, <i>The
    Acts of the Apostles</i>, &quot;the interest in Shechem and the emphasis upon it is
  remarkable in a speech addressed to Jews in Jerusalem, but they certainly could not
  contest the fact of Joseph's burial in the hated Samaritan territory.&quot; p. 139. If
  Stephen erred in detail here (see Marshall above), such an error might not pose any more
  problem for the inspiration of Acts than those cases where the disciples erred in the
  gospels (Compare Mt. 17:13 with Mk. 9:13). The author of Acts is not asserting these
  facts, he is merely reporting a synopsis of the speech accurately. </p>
<p class="style1">21Note that in vs. 37 Stephen cites the well known Messianic prediction that &quot;God
  will send you a prophet like me from your own people,&quot;(Deut. 18:15). The implication
  here is that King Messiah would be like Moses in all respects, including regular rejection
  by His own people.22This point is missed by Longnecker. Richard N. Longnecker, &quot;The
  Acts of the Apostles,&quot; pp. 343,344.23Mircea Eliade, <i>Patterns in Comparative
    Religion</i>. (The World Publishing Co.,Cleveland OH, 1958), p. 370. A
  &quot;Heirophany&quot; is a manifestation of, or an encounter with, the sacred. </p>
<p class="style1">24I Kings 6:1.25II Sam. 7:7.26Compare Paul Trudinger, &quot;Stephen and the Life of the
  Primitive Church&quot; in <i>Biblical Theology Bulletin</i>, Vol. 14 No. 1 (Jan. 1984), p.
  20. &quot;The building of the temple . . .is another example of Israel's sin. The building
  of the temple is right on a par with the making of the golden calf, to Stephen's way of
  thinking.&quot; Here Trudinger woodenly equates the misunderstanding of the temple with
  the building of it. See more correctly, P. Doble, &quot;The Son of Man Saying in Stephen's
  Witnessing: Acts 6:8-8:2,&quot; in <i>New Testament Studies</i>, Vol. 31 (1985). p. 79.
  This essay has limited value, especially the unconvincing comparison of Stephen's speech
  and Wisdom. Even Longnecker thinks that vss. 44-47 express &quot;disapproval&quot; on
  Stephen's part for the temple. Richard N. Longnecker, &quot;The Acts of the
  Apostles,&quot; p. 346. </p>
<p class="style1">27Modern critics have argued that the death of Stephen reflects the, &quot;beginning of
  an imatatio Christi motif in the biographies of the saints.&quot; If so, it is probably
  because of the influence of the Stephen text on later writers. Marcel Simon cited in Paul
  Trudinger, &quot;Stephen and the Life of the Primitive Church&quot; in <i>Biblical
    Theology Bulletin</i>, Vol. 14 No. 1 (Jan. 1984), p. 20. </p>
<p class="style1">28So argues P. Doble, &quot;The Son of Man Saying in Stephen's Witnessing: Acts
  6:8-8:2,&quot; in <i>New Testament Studies</i>, Vol. 31 (1985), p. 69.29F. F. Bruce, <i>New
    Testament History</i>, (Garden City, NY: Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc., 1980), p.
  226.30This is denied by Bruce. F. F. Bruce, <i>New Testament History</i>, p. 226, but no
  reasons are given. For a curious but not very credible analysis of the martyrdom of
  Stephen see Thomas Louis Brodie, O.P., &quot;The Accusing and Stoning of Naboth (1Kgs.
  21:8-13), as One Component of the Stephen Text (Acts 6:9-14; 7:58a),&quot; in The Catholic
  Biblical Quarterly, Vol.45, pp. 417-432. The author's effort to demonstrate that the
  narrative portions of the account are adapted by Luke from the Naboth narrative is
  completely unconvincing. </p>
<p class="style1">31Stephen, as a member of the &quot;Hellenistic&quot; group in the Jerusalem church,
  was probably less encumbered with the ethnocentricity, ritualism, and traditionalism of
  the &quot;Hebraic&quot; group in the Jerusalem church. The fact that Steven was chosen to
  rectify the inequity between these two groups suggests that, for whatever reason, he was
  more free of the race and cultural prejudice that was still present in the Jerusalem
  church at this time. </p>
<p class="style1">Bruce avers that, &quot;Stephen's attitude to the Temple betokens a much clearer
  appreciation of the incompatibility of the old order with the implications of the teaching
  of Jesus than appears to have been common among the early disciples in Jerusalem.&quot; F.
  F. Bruce, <i>New Testament History</i>, p. 223. </p>
<p class="style1">Marshal concurs, &quot;It would seem likely that Steven went much farther that the
  twelve in emphasizing this teaching [on the temple].&quot; Howard I. Marshall, <i>The Acts
    of the Apostles</i>, p. 128. </p>
<p class="style1">32He refers to this event calling Stephen God's martyr in Acts 22:20. Note also the
  charges brought against Paul in Acts 21:27ff, he preaches, &quot;against our people,
  against the law, and against this place&quot;. Paul used arguments that were similar to
  Stephen's, and may even have quoted him. See Acts 17:24-26 along with the excellent
  comments by R. J. Knowling, &quot;The Acts of the Apostles.&quot; in <i>The Expositor's
    Bible Commentary</i>, Vol. II p. 373.</p>

<h1>Sejanus and the Chronology of Christ's death</h1>

<hr>

<p>By <a href="../personal/gary.htm">Gary DeLashmutt</a></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Lucius Aelius Sejanus' bearing on church history is not immediately apparent to the
church historian. He is well known among Roman historians as the man who almost succeeded
in overthrowing Tiberius Caesar. However, his relationship with Pontius Pilate has an
important influence on what year one dates the death of Jesus. The purpose of this paper
is to give an overview of Sejanus' life, to examine his relationship with Pilate, and
finally to understand the impact of this information on the date of Jesus' death.</p>

<h3>An Overview Of Sejanus' Life</h3>

<h5>Birth and Youth</h5>

<p>Sejanus was born sometime between 4 BCE and 1 BCE in Etruria.<a name="Footnote1A">Footnote1</a>
He was born into an equestrian family and thus was not part of Roman nobility. Virtually
nothing is known about his youth.</p>

<p>Shortly after Tiberius became emperor in 14 CE, he made Sejanus' father Strabo
commander of the Praetorian Guard, the elite corps of Roman soldiers responsible for
protecting the city of Rome and the emperor himself.<a name="Footnote2A">Footnote2</a>
Strabo was one of Tiberius's most trusted administrators. He was awarded this post because
of his life-long loyalty and service to Tiberius.<a name="Footnote3A">Footnote3</a> The
earliest reports of Sejanus' adult life place him in Rome with Strabo at this time. Thus,
Sejanus almost definitely grew up knowing Tiberius personally and had easy access to him,
an advantage which he was to later exploit.</p>

<h5>Early Career</h5>

<p>In 16 CE, Sejanus was appointed Commander of the Praetorian Guard by Tiberius when he
made Strabo prefect of Egypt.<a name="Footnote4A">Footnote4</a> Sejanus distinguished
himself by significantly improving the organization of the Guard. Whereas they had
previously been quartered haphazardly with friends and neighbors, Sejanus built barracks
for them so that they could be more quickly mobilized in time of need.<a name="Footnote5A">Footnote5</a></p>

<p>In 17 CE, Sejanus was sent by Tiberius to accompany Drusus to suppress the mutiny of
the Pannonian legion.<a name="Footnote6A">Footnote6</a> Drusus was the son of Agrippina
and Germanicus, who was seen as the heir-apparent to Tiberius. Again, Sejanus
distinguished himself in this assignment and was rewarded for it by Tiberius. This may
have been interpreted by Drusus as a lack of confidence in him by Tiberius and thus
contributed to Drusus' enmity and rivalry toward Sejanus. Certainly this attitude toward
Sejanus emerged after Drusus' father Germanicus died in 19 CE and Drusus became the
heir-apparent.<a name="Footnote7A">Footnote7</a></p>

<p>In 23 CE, a fire broke out in a theater in Pompeii which ravaged the city. Sejanus was
assigned to handle the situation and restore the city. He did such an effective job that
Tiberius ordered a statue of Sejanus in his honor be erected at the site of the new
theater.<a name="Footnote8A">Footnote8</a></p>

<p>Thus, Sejanus's early career gave clear evidence of excellent administrative ability.
Always looking for someone who could ease the burden of administration, Tiberius evidently
was impressed by Sejanus's work. Tiberius thus continued to depend more and more on
Sejanus and take him into his confidence.<a name="Footnote9A">Footnote9</a> This set the
stage for Sejanus's rise to power.</p>

<h3>The Rise of Sejanus</h3>

<p>In 23 CE, Drusus died after a short, violent illness. Most Roman historians state that
Drusus' death was actually due to being poisoned.<a name="Footnote10A">Footnote10</a> This
explanation is based the testimony of Sejanus' wife shortly before she was executed in 31
CE. She stated that Sejanus and Drusus' wife Lavilla had become lovers and that they had
conspired to kill Drusus so that Sejanus could take his place as heir-apparent to
Tiberius. Both the goal of Sejanus' ambitions and the real cause of Drusus' death is
ambiguous and much debated by modern historians.<a name="Footnote11A">Footnote11</a></p>

<p>At any rate, with Drusus dead, Tiberius was in an unenviable spot. Now 64 years old, he
had for years wanted to retire from public life, leaving the leadership of the empire to
his successor and the Senate. Now he was unable to do so. The oldest male family members
were Drusus' children (Drusus, Nero and Gaius), and they were too young to be appointed
co-emperors.<a name="Footnote12A">Footnote12</a> In presenting these children to the care
of the Senate, Tiberius lamented his situation and even expressed a longing for the return
of the Republic.<a name="Footnote13A">Footnote13</a> Tiberius knew that his desire for the
Senate to take a more active role as they did in the Republic was unrealistic. Therefore,
he knew he would be unable to retire until one of these children grew to adulthood and
demonstrated competence, <cite>unless</cite> he had an administrator so competent and
trustworthy that he could safely leave the government in his hands as his regent in Rome.
It was to this position that Sejanus immediately aspired. In Tiberius, he found a man
strongly motivated to let him attain that role.</p>

<p>As Tiberius gave Sejanus more and more authority, Sejanus used his position to
eliminate those who were obstacles to his goal of ultimate power. In 25 CE, he had Cordus,
a historian, condemned, ostensibly for justifying Brutus' assassination of Julius Caesar.
Roman historians state that the real reason was that Cordos was an outspoken enemy of
Sejanus.<a name="Footnote14A">Footnote14</a></p>

<p>In 26 CE, Tiberius retired to the remote and almost inaccessible island of Capri, never
to return to Rome again.<a name="Footnote15A">Footnote15</a> Sejanus had played a major
role in convincing Tiberius to do this.<a name="Footnote16A">Footnote16</a> He also
&quot;proved&quot; his total loyalty to Tiberius by shielding Tiberius with his own body
during a cave collapse that year.<a name="Footnote17A">Footnote17</a> While still
retaining his full imperial authority, he left Sejanus in Rome as his regent. From this
point on, Sejanus' power increased dramatically. He was not only Tiberius' spokesman,
which made the senators curry his favor; he also carefully controlled all communications
to Tiberius on Capri.<a name="Footnote18A">Footnote18</a> In this way, Sejanus was able to
prey on Tiberius's fears of revolt and use him to eliminate the legitimate successors of
Tiberius. Whether Sejanus was actually aspiring to become emperor, or only seeking to
eliminate possible heirs so that he would not be eliminated by them when they came into
power is not clear.<a name="Footnote19A">Footnote19</a> What is clear is that he used his
position to eliminate them.</p>

<p>Immediately after Tiberius left Rome, Sejanus attempted to set Agrippina and her
grandsons against each other. Through his own agents, Sejanus tried to convince Agrippina
and Nero to leave Rome for their safety.<a name="Footnote20A">Footnote20</a> Through the
same agents, he was sending a steady report to Tiberius of their activities, attempting to
convince him that they were plotting revolt and should be executed. For the rest of 26 CE,
neither plan worked. Agrippina and Nero did not flee Rome, and Tiberius was not yet
convinced that they constituted a serious threat to his power.</p>

<p>In 27 CE, Sejanus had Sabinus, a supporter of Agrippina, condemned for sedition.<a name="Footnote21A">Footnote21</a> In the same year, he asked Tiberius for permission to
marry Lavilla, Drusus' wife.<a name="Footnote22A">Footnote22</a> This would have gained
him greater legitimacy with the Roman nobility and improved his chances of actually
becoming emperor. Tiberius refused to grant permission, seemingly out of deference to
Roman etiquette, while promising Sejanus much greater honor and fame and power in the near
future:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;What projects I have turned over in my mind; by what further ties I am preparing
  to bind you to myself, I will forbear for the present to disclose. This only I will permit
  myself to say, that there is no place too high for your merits, and your devotion to
  myself; and when the proper time shall come, whether in the Senate, or before the public,
  I shall not fail to speak.&quot;<a name="Footnote23A">Footnote23</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Historians disagree on Tiberius' motives for his reply. Some think that Tiberius should
be taken at face value, and that he still fully trusted Sejanus.<a name="Footnote24A">Footnote24</a>
Others think that Tiberius was suspicious of Sejanus by now, but also realized that he was
in a precarious position since he was in Capri and Sejanus was in control.<a name="Footnote25A">Footnote25</a> If this was the case, Tiberius' reply was calculated to
block Sejanus' power move, without arousing Sejanus' suspicions that Tiberius suspected
him of revolt.</p>

<h3>The Peak of Sejanus's Power</h3>

<p>Sejanus reached the peak of his power in 29 CE. Tiberius' mother died during this year,
yet he refused to come to her funeral in Rome. This is probably because he had begun to
believe Sejanus' charges that Agrippina was actively seeking to assassinate him.<a name="Footnote26A">Footnote26</a> Later that same year, Tiberius accused Agrippina (by
letter before the Senate) of adultery and Nero of &quot;vices&quot;.<a name="Footnote27A">Footnote27</a>
Both were exiled, where Nero eventually committed suicide and Agrippina, after being
ill-treated by her guards, starved herself to death.<a name="Footnote28A">Footnote28</a>
He also got Tiberius to condemn and imprison Drusus, where he committed suicide.<a name="Footnote29A">Footnote29</a> Only Gaius (now seventeen but with no administrative
experience) and Gamellus, a boy of ten, remained alive as heirs from the Julio-Claudian
line.<a name="Footnote30A">Footnote30</a> Gaius lived with Tiberius on Capri at this time,
making him inaccessible to Sejanus.</p>

<p>In early 30, Sejanus had Gallus, another supporter of Agrippina, condemned for
sedition.<a name="Footnote31A">Footnote31</a> When Sejanus got permission from Tiberius to
marry Livia Julia (Gaius' sister), he was in a seemingly very advantageous position. With
a marital claim to nobility, he was in a better position to be accepted by the nobility if
he attempted to seize imperial power. If that route was deemed seemed infeasible, he could
persuade Tiberius to appoint him Gaius' supervisor when Tiberius died and thus still
retain full control over the Emperor.<a name="Footnote32A">Footnote32</a></p>

<p>During 30, Sejanus also began to consolidate his power over the Roman armies in foreign
lands. He probably realized that in the event of a revolt they could crush him if they did
not want him as emperor. So he replaced many of the commanders with men loyal to him, and
he deposed many who were loyal to Drusus and his family.<a name="Footnote33A">Footnote33</a></p>

<p>During the period from 29 to 30 CE, Tiberius made it clear that he regarded Sejanus as
his exclusive representative in Rome. The Senate voted that his birthday be honored
publicly. Public prayers and sacrifices were offered on behalf of &quot;Tiberius and
Sejanus&quot; and oaths were sworn &quot;by the Fortunes of Tiberius and Sejanus&quot;.<a name="Footnote34A">Footnote34</a> Twice previously during his reign, Tiberius had held the
consulship of the Senate with his acknowledged successor: in 18 CE with Germanicus, and in
21 CE with Drusus. Now in 30 CE, Tiberius declared his intentions to make himself and
Sejanus consuls the following year.<a name="Footnote35A">Footnote35</a> All indications
were that soon Tiberius would confer the tribunician power on Sejanus, making him a <i>de
facto</i> joint-emperor and successor of Tiberius after his death.<a name="Footnote36A">Footnote36</a></p>

<h3>The Fall of Sejanus</h3>

<p>Probably in early 31 CE, Tiberius received a letter from his widowed sister-in-law
Antonia.<a name="Footnote37A">Footnote37</a> Perhaps because she had always remained above
the intrigues of Roman politics, Tiberius trusted her. She told him that Sejanus was
plotting a revolt and detailed many of the ways in which he was doing this. Whether or not
this was the first time Tiberius suspected Sejanus is debatable.<a name="Footnote38A">Footnote38</a>
However, from this time forward, he acts in such a way that makes it clear (at least to us
in retrospect) that he knew of Sejanus' treason.</p>

<p>First, Tiberius began to send a &quot;mixed message&quot; about Sejanus to the Roman
senators. On the one hand, he continued to lavish praise and power upon him. He referred
to Sejanus as &quot;my Sejanus&quot;. He fulfilled his promise to make Sejanus a consul of
the Senate, and minted coins and erected statues in his honor. On the other hand, he began
to speak in a mildly critical way of Sejanus and his allies.<a name="Footnote39A">Footnote39</a>
He also refused to condemn Arruntus against Sejanus's wishes, and thus prevented Sejanus
from gaining full control over the Senate.<a name="Footnote40A">Footnote40</a> Later that
same year, Tiberius resigned his consulship, thus forcing Sejanus to do the same<a name="Footnote41A">Footnote41</a>. Tiberius then made Gaius consul, thus indicating that
he had now chosen Gaius as his successor.<a name="Footnote42A">Footnote42</a> He forbade
all sacrifices to living humans, thus stopping public homage to Sejanus.<a name="Footnote43A">Footnote43</a></p>

<p>While Tiberius was thus keeping Sejanus off-balance, he was testing the loyalty other
quarters of leadership in Rome. He ascertained that the senators strongly disliked Sejanus
even though they had curried his favor. He also found that the Praetorian Guard was loyal
to Sejanus only as his (Tiberius') regent.<a name="Footnote44A">Footnote44</a></p>

<p>Thus satisfied of his security, Tiberius hatched a brilliant and elaborate plot to
depose Sejanus.<a name="Footnote45A">Footnote45</a> He made Macro the new commander of the
Praetorian Guard. He then sent Macro to Rome with a letter to be read before the Senate.
Macro intercepted Sejanus on the way and told him that the letter gave him tribunician
power - virtual imperial authority. Once Sejanus went inside, Macro presented proof of his
Praetorian authority over Sejanus' guards. He then sent them back to the barracks and
surrounded the Senate with his own loyal soldiers. While the purposefully long, rambling
letter was read, Macro went to the barracks to assure that no uprising would take place
among the troops.</p>

<p>Tiberius' rambling letter ended with a scathing denunciation of Sejanus and demanded
his arrest. Stunned, Sejanus was led out. When the senators saw that the common people and
the Praetorian Guard rejoiced at Sejanus' arrest, they condemned and executed him the same
day - October 18, 31 CE.</p>

<h3>After Sejanus's Fall</h3>

<p>Tiberius then launched an investigation into the conspiracy. All of Sejanus' family
were killed, as was customary.<a name="Footnote46A">Footnote46</a> Though Tacitus
describes this period as a reign of terror and a blood-bath, Seutonius and others
disagree.<a name="Footnote47A">Footnote47</a> Tarver says that Tiberius moved in to check
the indiscriminate persecution of Sejanus' friends.<a name="Footnote48A">Footnote48</a>
Tiberius evidently made a real effort to be just in his investigation. Over the next three
to four years, many people were tried. Some were convicted and executed; some were allowed
to turn state's evidence; some were acquitted. All in all, several dozen people were
executed.<a name="Footnote49A">Footnote49</a> Satisfied that the conspiracy had been
sufficiently rooted out, Tiberius dropped the matter around 34 CE. He died shortly
thereafter in 37 CE.</p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Relationship Between Sejanus and Pilate</font></p>

<p>The available evidence indicates that Pilate was appointed to the office of prefect of
Judea by Sejanus. This evidence consists of two bases.</p>

<h5>The Date Pilate Was Sent to Judea</h5>

<p>No ancient record dates the beginning of Pilate's rule in Judea exactly, nor do they
specifically say that Sejanus appointed Pilate. The only chronological record of Pilate's
appointment is found in Josephus who says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;(Tiberius)...sent Valerius Gratus to be procurator of Judea, and to succeed Annus
  Rufus...When Gratus had done those things, he went back to Rome, after he had tarried in
  Judea <i>eleven</i> years, when Pontius Pilate became his successor...So Pilate, when he
  had tarried <i>ten</i> years in Judea, made haste to Rome...but before he could get to
  Rome, Tiberius was dead.&quot;<a name="Footnote50A">Footnote50</a> (italics mine)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Josephus infers (and the subsequent chronology demands) that Tiberius sent Gratus very
soon after becoming emperor. Tiberius became emperor on September 17, 14 CE.<a name="Footnote51A">Footnote51</a> Pilate was removed from office to appear immediately
before Tiberius, but Tiberius died while Pilate was en route. Tiberius died on March 16,
37 CE.<a name="Footnote52A">Footnote52</a> Therefore, Pilate was removed no later than
late 36 CE.</p>

<p>Gratus therefore assumed his post in 15 CE at the latest. If he ruled for approximately
eleven years, then he was removed in 26 or 27 CE. If Pilate ruled approximately ten years,
he must have begun his rule in 26 or 27 CE. Therefore, both agree that Pilate was sent to
Judea in either 26 or 27 CE.</p>

<p>Tiberius retired to Capri sometime in 26 CE.<a name="Footnote53A">Footnote53</a> The
exact date is not known, but because of the above data, it is very likely that Pilate was
sent after Tiberius retired. In that case, he was appointed by Sejanus.<a name="Footnote54A">Footnote54</a> Even if he was appointed slightly before Tiberius
retired, it is likely that Sejanus was still the main influence behind the appointment,
since Tiberius had granted considerable authority to Sejanus in these kinds of matters by
this time.</p>

<h3>Sejanus' and Pilate's Anti-semitic Policies</h3>

<p>Josephus details Pilate's hatred and baiting of the Jewish people, which will
elaborated upon below. Philo claims that Sejanus was anti-semitic and planned to destroy
the Jewish race completely.<a name="Footnote55A">Footnote55</a> Though Tiberius was
probably also anti-semitic, he realized after Sejanus was exposed that many of the charges
brought against the Jews were fabricated by Sejanus, so in 32 CE he issued a decree
throughout the Empire not to mistreat the Jews.</p>

<p>It is likely that Pilate was simply carrying out Sejanus' anti-semitic policy. Philo
does not actually say this; rather, this is inferred from what Philo says in the following
passage. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Therefore everyone everywhere, even if he was not naturally well disposed toward
  the Jews, was afraid to engage in destroying any of our institutions, and indeed it was
  the same under Tiberius though matters in Italy became troublesome <i>when Sejanus was
  organizing his onslaughts</i>. For Tiberius knew the truth, he knew at once after Sejanus'
  death that the accusations made against the Jewish inhabitants of Rome were false
  slanders, invented by him because he wished to make away with the nation, knowing that it
  would take the sole or the principal part in opposing his unholy plots and actions, and
  would defend the emperor when in danger of becoming the victim of treachery. <i>And he
  charged his procurators in every place to which they were appointed</i> to speak
  comfortably to the members of our nation in the different cities, assuring them that the
  penal measures did not extend to all but only to the guilty, who were few, and to disturb
  none of the established customs but even to regard them as a trust committed to their
  care, the people as naturally peaceable, and the institutions as an influence promoting
  orderly conduct.&quot;<a name="Footnote56A">Footnote56</a> (italics mine)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is clear from this passage that Sejanus was propagating anti-semitic policies while
he was in power. It is also clear that procurators with jurisdiction over Jewish
communities practiced those policies under Sejanus' authority. Finally, it is clear that
Tiberius told those procurators that such policy was no longer permissible.</p>

<p>What prefect would have had more policies concerning the Jews than Pilate? Certainly
Pilate's treatment of the Jews prior to the fall of Sejanus conforms to Sejanus' policies,
as we will see. Pilate must have received Tiberius' edict after Sejanus' execution, for
his treatment of the Jews changes after 32 CE, as we will also see. Therefore, it is
reasonable to assume that Pilate was either appointed to his position by Sejanus, or at
least that he was a willing executor of Sejanus' policies toward the Jews.</p>

<p>Eusebius, almost quoting Philo, clearly makes the same inference:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;...Sejanus, who was then in great favor with Tiberius, had made every effort to
  destroy the whole nation of the Jews from the foundation, <i>and that</i> in Pontius
  Pilate under whom the crimes were committed against our Savior, having attempted
  everything contrary to what was lawful among the Jews respecting the Temple at Jerusalem,
  which was then yet standing, excited them to the greatest tumults.&quot;<a name="Footnote57A">Footnote57</a> (italics mine)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These quotes, together with the chronological data supplied above, indicate that Pilate
was probably sent to Judea by Sejanus and that he actively pursued Sejanus's policies with
the Jews. Pilate held his post by the favor of Sejanus and he was identified with Sejanus
by those over whom he ruled.</p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Effect of Sejanus on Dating Jesus' Death</font></p>

<p>Before one can meaningfully assess the effect of Sejanus on the dating of Jesus's
death, certain facts must be first understood.</p>

<h5>The Possible Dates of Jesus' Death</h5>

<p>Since Jesus died while Pilate was procurator of Judea, he must have died roughly
between 26 and 37 CE. Furthermore, the New Testament states that he died on a Passover
which fell on a Friday.<a name="Footnote58A">Footnote58</a> Astronomical calculations
ascertain that this occurred possibly on 27 CE, and almost certainly 30, 33 and 36 CE.<a name="Footnote59A">Footnote59</a> 27 and 36 CE can both be discounted because of Lk.
3:1,2.<a name="Footnote60A">Footnote60</a> Therefore, Jesus died either on 30 or 33 CE.</p>

<p>If one assumes that Pilate was appointed by Sejanus and was actively carrying out his
policies, two important aspects of the gospel narratives of Jesus' trial make perfect
sense if the date is 33 CE, after Sejanus' downfall. However, the same aspects are very
problematic if the date is 30 CE, before Sejanus' fall.</p>

<h5>Pilate's Change in Behavior Toward the Jews</h5>

<p>As was noted above, Pilate had a consistent record of hostility toward the Jews - even
to the point of baiting them several times. Soon after arriving in Judea, he had ordered
Roman standards brought within the city of Jerusalem under the cover of night, knowing
that it would infuriate the Jewish people's beliefs about the sanctity of the city. When
they protested he threatened to kill many of them and not until they bared their throats
to be cut did he realize that the move was not worth the trouble.<a name="Footnote61A">Footnote61</a></p>

<p>On another occasion, Pilate used money from the Temple treasury to construct an
aqueduct. When the Jews assembled outside his quarters to protest, he ordered soldiers to
dress like the Jews and mingle among the crowd. On his signal, the soldiers drew clubs
hidden in their clothes and beat and killed many of the Jews.<a name="Footnote62A">Footnote62</a></p>

<p>Later, possibly in 29/30 CE, Pilate introduced coins engraved with a symbol of
Emperor-worship.<a name="Footnote63A">Footnote63</a> In Lk. 13:1, Jesus is asked about the
&quot;Galileans whose blood Pilate mingled with their sacrifices&quot;, a reference to the
murder of some Jews coupled with purposeful desecration of Jewish worship.</p>

<p>Therefore, the early years of Pilate are characterized by an almost complete disdain
for the Jews. He purposefully baited them into reacting and then punished them for
reacting. It would be very consistent for him to do this if he was Sejanus' appointee. </p>

<p>Yet the gospels, though clearly cognizant of Pilate's past behavior, present Pilate
during the trial as a man fearful of the Jews and eager to please them. He knows Jesus is
innocent<a name="Footnote64A">Footnote64</a>, but gives into condemning him in order to
please the Jews. One would expect exactly the opposite reaction from Pilate: that he would
insist on Jesus's acquittal <cite>because</cite> the Jewish leaders wanted him condemned.
Instead, the gospels say that Pilate tried to release Jesus because the Jewish leaders
delivered up out of envy<a name="Footnote65A">Footnote65</a> (i.e., to bait them), but
that when they threatened him with an appeal to Rome, he backed down and granted their
wish.<a name="Footnote66A">Footnote66</a></p>

<p>How is this discrepancy to be explained? Such behavior is simply not tenable before
Sejanus' demise. As was noted above, Sejanus was executed on 31 CE. From 31 to 34 CE,
Tiberius was investigating and prosecuting Sejanus's co-conspirators. If Jesus's trial was
after this time, especially if it was after Tiberius's 32 CE decree against mistreating
the Jews, Pilate would be very uneasy about any report getting back to Tiberius. Being
Sejanus' appointee, he may well have been under suspicion already as it was. However, if
Jesus' trial occurred in 30 CE, there would be no reason for Pilate to not continue his
policy of baiting the Jews, since Sejanus was in control and would back him up.</p>

<p>Thus, the drastic change in Pilate's behavior toward the Jews in Jesus's trial is very
consistent after 31 CE, but very inconsistent before that time.</p>

<h3>The Jews' Use of &quot;Amicus Caesaris&quot;</h3>

<p>During the trial of Jesus by Pilate, Pilate several times tells the Jewish leaders that
Jesus is innocent. On his final attempt, John records:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;...Pilate made efforts to release him (Jesus), but the Jews cried out, saying 'If
  you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar; everyone who makes himself out to be a
  king opposes Caesar.' <i>When Pilate therefore heard these words</i>, he brought Jesus
  out, and sat down on the judgment seat...And so he then delivered him up to them to be
  crucified.&quot;<a name="Footnote67A">Footnote67</a> (italics mine)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The term &quot;friend of Caesar&quot; (Latin: <i>amicus Caesaris</i>) is a technical
term reserved for senators, knights and administrators who were meritorious and thus
favored by the emperor.<a name="Footnote68A">Footnote68</a> To lose this title was to lose
not only one's post, but also to possibly complete ostracism from Roman life, as
illustrated by Gallus in 26 BCE under Augustus.<a name="Footnote69A">Footnote69</a></p>

<p>Therefore, the Jews were uttering a threat to Pilate. They were claiming to have the
power to potentially have Pilate stripped of this title. This threat is highly significant
for two reasons. First, it is inconceivable that the Jews would utter it as long as
Sejanus was in control. They knew that all communication to Tiberius was controlled by
Sejanus, and they also knew that Pilate's anti-semitic policies were in accordance with
Sejanus' policies.<a name="Footnote70A">Footnote70</a> Such a threat makes sense <i>only</i>
if Tiberius is back in control of the empire <cite>and</cite> if Pilate is under imperial
censure or warning because of his association with Sejanus.</p>

<p>Second, even if the Jews did utter such a threat, Pilate would have had no reason to
respond to it while Sejanus was in control. Pilate's response becomes intelligible <cite>only</cite>
after 31, when Sejanus was deposed.</p>

<p><font face="Arial">Conclusion</font></p>

<p>The fact that Sejanus's downfall came in 31 CE has a very significant impact on dating
the death of Jesus. Only 30 or 33 CE are tenable years for Jesus' death. Pilate was
probably Sejanus' appointee who actively carried out his anti-semitic policies, and thus
was in danger after Sejanus was executed. The behavior of Pilate and the Jews during the
trial of Jesus makes sense only after Sejanus' demise. Therefore, 33 CE is the preferable
date for the death of Jesus.</p>

<p>Augustus designated his step-son Germanicus to be his successor. Tiberius was seen as
an emperor-regent for Germanicus until he came of age. This is why after Germanicus'
premature death, his wife Agrippina began to clamor that her son Drusus was the rightful
successor. See Frank Burr Marsh, <cite>The Reign of Tiberius (London: Oxford University

<p>Seager believes Tacitus' report, though says it was embellished by his rhetoric (see
Robin Seager, <cite>Tiberius, pp. 229-233). Smith maintains that &quot;the number of
prosecutions was not large, however, in view of the fact that the emperor apparently was
convinced of the actual existence of a conspiracy&quot; (see Charles Edward Smith,
Tiberius and the Roman Empire, p. 150). Marsh agrees, saying, &quot;The number of
prosecutions is much smaller than might have been expected after what had passed, and the
proceedings seem to show that a real attempt was made to secure justice; in short the
whole of the Tiberian Terror is a product of imagination and rhetoric quite unsupported by
evidence&quot; (see Frank Burr Marsh, The Reign of Tiberius, p. 200).</cite></p>

<p>Maier' language is very strong on this point. He says, &quot;It seems more than
probable that in 26 AD, Pontius Pilate was nominated to succeed Valerius Gratus as <cite>praefectus
Judaeae by L. Aelius Sejanus...Undoubtedly it was Pontius Pilate's implementation of
Sejanus' policy in Palestine which caused the familiar imbroglios with the Jews...&quot;
(see P.L. Maier, &quot;Sejanus, Pilate and the Date of the Crucifixion&quot;, pp. 8,9).
Hoehner is almost as strong. He says, &quot;It is probable that when Pontius Pilate
succeeded Valerius Gratus as prefect of Judea in AD 26 he was appointed by the equestrian
Lucius Aelius Sejanus&quot; (see Harold W. Hoehner, &quot;Chronological Aspects of the
Life of Christ, Part V: The Year of Christ's Crucifixion&quot;, Bibliotheca Sacra 131
(October-December, 1974):341). These authors are trying to establish a 33 CE death date
for Jesus, so their views on this issue may be somewhat biased. However, other sources not
biased in this area also agree that Pilate owed his appointment to Sejanus. See, for
example, The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York: Robert Appleton Co., 1911), Vol. 12, p.614.</cite></p>

<p>Mk 14:12 makes it clear that Passover began the night of the Last Supper. Jn 19:31
makes it clear that the evening following Jesus' death was the beginning of the Sabbath
(Saturday). Therefore, Jesus died on a Friday which was also Passover Day.</p>

<p>Luke states that John the Baptist commenced his ministry &quot;in the fifteenth year of
the reign of Tiberius Caesar&quot;, which would be 28/29 CE. This cancels out 26 CE. Since
no one can make a case for Jesus' public ministry lasting more than four years, this would
also cancel out 36 CE.</p>

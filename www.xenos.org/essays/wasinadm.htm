<h3 class="style1">Adapted From <a href="../books/wiv.htm">Walking In Victory</a> (Navpress)</h3>

<p class="style1">Before anything can change on the deepest level in our lives, we have to lose the
identity we have in Adam. As long as that identity remains the same, our outer actions may
change to some extent, but such change doesn't amount to much in the ultimate sense.
Losing our identity in Adam is different than losing our sin nature, as we will see later.</p>

<p class="style1">Consider our treatments for the common cold. We take nasal decongestants to reduce
inflammation. We take aspirin for the headaches and pains. We may even take an
antihistamine to dry up our runny nose. But one thing should be clear: none of these
things will cure the cold. Such treatments only control the <strong><i>symptoms</i></strong>
of the cold, they cannot cure it. That's because there <strong><i>is</i></strong> no cure
for the common cold! Since we have no cure, we might as well at least try to control the
symptoms. We have no better option.</p>

<p class="style1">Many Christians must have reached the same conclusion about their sin nature. They are
trying different solutions to control the worst of the symptoms of the Adam-nature, but
none of their measures are getting at the source of the problem. This is unfortunate,
because with the Adam-nature, we do have a cure! It's a shame to see people dealing with
their sin problems only on the symptomatic level when they could be experiencing real
change.</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="style1">An important qualification</h2>

<p class="style1">Before going on, we need to make one very important qualification. When we argue that
trying to alter our outer behavior is like trying to control the symptoms of a cold, you
might conclude that any effort to deal with external behavioral problems is Phariseeism.
You might even conclude that efforts in this direction will prevent or block real change
based on who you are rather than on what you do. But this would be the wrong conclusion.</p>

<p class="style1">There is nothing wrong with controlling negative symptoms.</p>

<hr size="2">
<span class="style1"><b></span>
<p class="style1">Controlling symptoms is not <i>wrong</i>, but it is <i>insufficient</i>.</b> </p>

<hr size="2">

<p class="style1">We should find ways to decrease destructive behavior in our lives and to increase
positive behavior. Such behavioral control only becomes a problem when controlling our
behavior is <strong><i>the only thing</i></strong> we do. It becomes a serious problem
when we begin to define our spiritual state on the basis of how well the battle with
behaviors is going.</p>

<p class="style1">To state this differently, the issue is not whether we attempt to control behaviors,
but how we view that attempt. Do we see controlling our behaviors, or our performance, as
either the <strong><i>definition</i></strong> of spiritual growth or the <strong><i>key</i></strong>
to spiritual growth? If we answer &quot;yes&quot; to either one of these questions, we
have a very serious problem, not unlike that of the Pharisees. On the other hand, there
may be certain areas of sin in our lives which need to be controlled in an external way,
even though this is not the key to growth. We need to control some particularly
destructive behaviors even if by external means, so they will not block our advancement
toward maturity on a deeper level. We could say that, while controlling negative behavior
is not the key to growth, it could be a pre-condition to growth in some cases.</p>

<p class="style1">Let's look at a couple of examples where this might be true. Suppose you are an
alcoholic. Your drinking and your abuse of your family are sinful and destructive.
Stopping these behaviors will not make you a mature Christian, but it may nevertheless be
necessary to seek control of the behaviors, <strong><i>even through external means</i></strong>,
like avoiding drinking situations or even entering a hospital. Stopping the drinking, may
open the door for other, more complete solutions.</p>

<p class="style1">The same could be true of promoting positive behaviors. Suppose you are one who has
problems with other people. You don't like to go out in the evening, and groups of people
make you nervous. In such a state, it may be very difficult to take advantage of Christian
fellowship. Unless you find ways to overcome such a reluctance to act, it will be
difficult to fully understand God's plan for your life.</p>

<p class="style1">Again, a problem arises when the struggle to gain a measure of control over certain
areas of behavior becomes the defining issue of our lives. It is all too easy to begin to
view enhancement of our external performance as being equal to spiritual growth. But even
non-Christians change their behavior! Many Hindu and Buddhist religionists undergo
disciplines much more impressive than any we are likely to practice. But is this the same
as being conformed to the image of Christ? It is not.</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="style1">The fate of the Adamic person</h2>

<p class="style1">If we received our identity in Adam simply by being born, how will we ever get rid of
it? The Bible is crystal clear on this point:</p>

<hr size="2">
<span class="style1"><b></span>
<p class="style1">The only possible fate for the person in Adam is death.</b> </p>

<hr size="2">

<p class="style1">God will not set about renovating the Adamic person for use in the Kingdom. The verdict
of death has already been decreed over this humanity. Verse 15 of Romans 5 states it
plainly: &quot; . . .by the transgression of the one the many died . . ..&quot; Earlier in
Romans this message is repeatedly emphasized. &quot;The wages of sin is death,&quot;
proclaims Romans 6:23a, and we can rest assured, God will not change his verdict. Yet, he
is able to say, &quot; . . . the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our
Lord.&quot; (6:23b)</p>

<p class="style1">We already know that Christ bore the penalty for our sin on the cross. This explains
why God can forgive us and give us eternal life. But what about the effect of his death in
<strong><i>this</i></strong> life? How will the death of Christ affect our spiritual
growth?</p>

<p class="style1">Here is where our study of identity in Adam begins to pay dividends. Romans 5 and 6
teach that, like Adam, Christ has become a new federal head. This is what Paul means in
Romans 6, verses 3 and 4:</p>

<p class="style1">Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been
baptized into His death? Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into
death, in order that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father,
so we too might walk in newness of life. </p>

<p class="style1">We saw earlier the only way to escape the domination of the Adam nature is death. Now
this passage mentions death in the same connection, but with a different twist. Here we
discover not only that Jesus died in our place but that somehow we died <strong><i>with</i></strong>
him.</p>

<p class="style1">This passage is teaching that God has declared us to be &quot;in Christ,&quot; which,
among other things, means we have died to what we were &quot;in Adam.&quot; What does this
saying , &quot;in Christ,&quot; mean? It is easy to understand a similar statement;
&quot;Christ in me.&quot; I open my heart, and Christ enters as promised in Revelation
3:20 and elsewhere. But here we are hearing something completely different: not Christ in
me, but me in Christ!</p>

<p class="style1">This is what theologians call &quot;identification with Christ.&quot; It means God has
acted in such a way that we have become <strong><i>identified</i></strong> with Christ.
Therefore, as far as God is concerned, what is true of Christ's standing has become true
of us. Did Jesus die? Then so did I. Did Jesus rise from the dead? Then I, too, rose from
the dead. The comparisons can be pressed even further. Did Jesus ascend to the Father in
heaven? Then according to my identification with Christ, I too ascended to heaven and took
my seat at the right hand of the Father! This is expressly stated in Ephesians 2:5,6:
&quot;And even when we were dead in our sin and transgression [God] made us alive together
with Christ . . . and raised us up with him, and seated us with him in the heavenly places
in Christ.&quot; Of course we have not become the creators of the world, nor have we
become deity, but the areas where we are identified with Christ go much further than many
of us would think.</p>

<p class="style1">This seems quite abstract. In what sense am I seated with Christ in heaven? In what
sense am I still seated right here? How can God say I died, when I clearly am alive?
Wouldn't I have noticed this experience?</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="style1">Using Our Insight</h2>

<p class="style1">We already have the key to answering these questions. That key is federal headship.
Adam was our federal head. We didn't feel or sense anything he did. There was no tangible
experience on our part. Yet, what we <strong><i>are</i></strong> was directly impacted by
this man. In&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ICorinthians 15:45 it says,
&quot;The first Adam became a living soul, the last Adam became a life giving
spirit.&quot; Jesus is the last Adam. He is a second federal head. He is called the last
Adam because, just as Adam gave rise to a fallen humanity, Christ has become the source of
a new, righteous humanity. One humanity is doomed to die; the other humanity has already
died. One humanity lives in alienation from God; the other is alive to God.</p>

<p class="style1">Paul reiterates this in I Corinthians 15:21,22. &quot;For since by a man came death, by
a man also came the resurrection from the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ
all shall be made alive.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="style1">Baptism into Christ</h2>

<p class="style1">These statements in I Corinthians are no different than what we have seen in Romans 6.
According to our passage, the key to our new identity is that we have been &quot;baptized
into Christ.&quot; This is not referring to water baptism, but to spiritual baptism.</p>

<p class="style1">The word <strong><i>baptizo</i></strong>, which is translated &quot;baptize&quot; need
not refer to a ritual where people are washed or immersed in water. Sometimes the term is
used for immersing people into other things. For instance, John said Jesus would baptize
people in the Spirit or in Fire. (Matthew 3:11) Jesus asked James and John whether they
were able to undergo the baptism he would undergo, apparently referring to his suffering
and death. (Mar. 10:38) There are other uses of the word as well. It should be clear that
the exact meaning of baptism must be determined in each passage by considering the
context. The word means &quot;immersion&quot; or a &quot;putting into.&quot; But immersion
into what?</p>

<p class="style1">Here in Romans 6 he is not commenting on our immersion into water, but into Christ.
This the baptism by the Spirit. Paul says this &quot;baptism,&quot; or immersion into
Christ, is an integral part of becoming a Christian. He often refers to God's act of
placing believers into Christ. In I Corinthians 12:13 he says, &quot;By one Spirit we were
all baptized into one body . . ..&quot; This is why believers are called the body of
Christ. In I Corinthians 1:30 Paul says, &quot;by God's doing you are in Christ
Jesus.&quot; The Spirit of God has somehow baptized, or placed us into Christ.</p>

<p class="style1">Theologians refer to this oneness with Christ as the &quot;mystical union&quot; of
believers with Christ. Over 100 times in the New Testament the expressions &quot;in
Christ,&quot; &quot;in the beloved,&quot; &quot;in him&quot; or similar phrases are used
of believers. The mystical union of the believers with Christ is not an obscure concept
found off in the corner somewhere. Many of the most important promises God has given us
are linked directly to this union. Here are some important examples:</p>

<p class="style1"><b>Table 0.1 Things we receive based on our identification with Christ</b> </p>

<p class="style1">When we analyze the promises in these and other passages, we find the over-arching
theme is that what is true of Christ has become true of us who are in Christ. Christ is
victorious; therefore we are led in his victory. Christ is at the right hand of God;
therefore we are also. According to Romans 6, death and resurrection are two of the most
important things true of us if we are in Christ.</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="style1">God's Viewpoint</h2>

<p class="style1">Whatever this teaching means, it must be very important, considering the promises
attached directly to it. It may help to consider the problem from God's viewpoint.</p>

<p class="style1">As already stated, God's verdict on the Adam nature is final. We will never experience
freedom from our fallen nature until we die and are resurrected in a new body. What is God
to do in the meantime? One solution might be to strike dead all who receive Christ
immediately and take them to heaven right there and then. This solution has some obvious
drawbacks. If everyone who believed in Christ immediately fell dead, Christian evangelism
might become harder than it already is! Besides, who would do the witnessing?</p>

<p class="style1">Whether for these reasons or others, this is not the direction God has decided to go.
Instead of striking all believers dead, he has judicially <strong><i>declared</i></strong>
them dead by identifying them with Christ. This means God elects to view us as though we
were in Christ. That is, he views us the same way he views his son. This is certainly good
news. Our standing before God couldn't be higher! But is it real? Or is this just double
talk? How can it be true that I have died and am seated in heaven, when I am clearly
sitting right here, seemingly the same as ever?</p>

<p class="style1">There are a few points which should help clarify this concept for us.</p>

<p class="style1">First, who views us as being &quot;the righteousness of God?&quot; I know I find it
very hard to view myself that way. My wife finds it even harder! No, it is God who, in the
first place, views me this way. But we should not take this to mean our identification
with Christ is just some dream in the mind of God. Actually, our status is quite real.
Consider the fact that one day our fallen existence will end, either when we die or when
the Lord returns. However, our standing in Christ will never end. When we think of it this
way, our standing in Christ is even more &quot;real&quot; than our life in Adam.</p>

<p class="style1">Second, the fact that we have been identified with Christ is an item of faith for
Christians. I Corinthians 1:30 says, &quot;by God's doing you are in Christ.&quot; That is
a plain proposition which we might not fully understand, but which we need to accept as a
direct declaration by God. We don't need to be able to confirm this statement with some
kind of experience or feeling. It is a fact of Scripture, which deserves willing belief
from those of us who view Scripture as our ultimate standard of truth. The truest thing
about us is what God says about us.</p>

<p class="style1">Remember, we did not sense or feel anything of Adam's fall, yet we received a fallen
nature because he was our federal head. There certainly could be other explanations for
why we have a selfish nature. The reason we, as Christians, believe our problems came from
Adam is not that our experience tells us so, but because God has declared this to us in
his Word.</p>

<p class="style1">God also declares that those of us who have trusted Christ have died and risen with
him, though we cannot feel this truth either. Therefore, we have the same reason for
believing in our identification with Christ as in our identification with Adam--God tells
us so.</p>

<p class="style1">Finally, when we consider our sense of identity, we realize that how God looks at us is
not an unimportant abstraction. This idea is so important, and it comes up so often in the
study to follow, we will devote a whole chapter to understanding it.</p>

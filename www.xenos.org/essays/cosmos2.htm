<h1>COSMOLOGY II</h1>

<h3>HISTORICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN COSMOLOGY</h3>

<h5>Larry House</h5>

<hr>

<p>Cosmology has evolved from an essentially religious and mythical description of the
supernaturalistic origins and nature of the universe to an essentially naturalistic
description. These cosmological descriptions originated from man's attempt to answer
several fundamental questions about the universe: 

<ul>
  <li>Why is there a universe? </li>
  <li>Is the universe finite or infinite? </li>
  <li>If finite then how big? </li>
  <li>Did the universe always exist or did it have a beginning? </li>
  <li>If the universe had a beginning then how did it come into being? </li>
  <li>When did it come into being? </li>
  <li>Where did it come into being? </li>
  <li>What exists in the universe? </li>
  <li>How do the contents of the universe behave and interact?</li>
</ul>

<p>Ancient cosmologies and even cosmologies emerging through the age of enlightenment were
closely intertwined with religious belief. Only within the last half-century or so has a
specialized science of cosmology emerged without making explicit mention of God or
deities. In these modern cosmologies immediate human concerns often appear to dwindle to
insignificance in the scale of cosmic time and space. Before the twentieth century it
often seemed that any serious non-mythical investigation of the ordered universe led to a
Mover or a Designer who could be assimilated to the being whom men and women worshiped as
God.<a href="#Footnote1B" name="Footnote1A"> Footnote1</a> </p>

<p>The following are brief summaries of the major cosmologies influencing western thought.
The progressive development toward modern scientific cosmologies can be detected in each
subsequent cosmology.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p><b>Plato's Cosmology (428/427-348/347 B.C.)</b> - Plato's account takes the form of a
creation story, in the tradition of Greek mythologists. It is narrated by a philosopher
named Timaeus of Locris (apparently a fictional character modeled on several of the
Pre-Socratics). In this account, the whole of nature is initiated by a creator divinity,
called the &quot;Demiurge&quot; (the Geek word for 'craftsman'), who seeks, to the best
degree possible, to imitate through physical copies the ideally perfect structures of true
being (i.e., the Ideas, or 'paradigms'). In this way he institutes the visible cosmos,
that is, the ordered domain of things that are susceptible of process and change (e.g.,
birth, growth, alteration, and dissolution - the realm of 'becoming,' genesis). The
Demiurge himself only assembles the supreme model of the cosmos, the 'world soul', and
then delegates his divine subordinates to fit out the detailed structures of the parts of
the cosmos. It follows that the whole cosmic system is pervaded with analogical
structures, most notably, the human form, which becomes a copy of the whole - a microcosm,
as it were - by virtue of the activity of these divine surrogates. All phenomena of nature
can be described as an interplay between the two forces of reason and necessity. He
represents reason as constituting the world soul. The material medium (four elements of
earth, air, water and fire) is introduced as the 'receptacle' representing the domain of
necessity. It is unclear whether Plato intended his cosmology as a literally true account
of a created cosmos or a metaphysical fiction. Aristotle insisted that Plato must be held
to his literal work, whereas Plato's immediate disciples favored a metaphorical reading.
Division of opinion has continued to the present day. </p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p><b>Aristotle's Cosmology (384-322 B.C.)</b> - Aristotle's cosmology was to dominate
thought in the Western World for more than 2,000 years and its overthrow is arguably the
major achievement of Renaissance science. Aristotle's views on the organization and
structure of the universe are presented in De caelo. This work contains some of the basic
considerations of motion. All locomotion is either straight, circular, or a combination of
the two; and all bodies are either simple (i.e., composed of a single element, such as
fire or earth) or are compounds. The element fire and bodies composed of it have a natural
movement upward: bodies composed of earth have a natural movement downward (i.e., toward
the center of the universe which is the earth). Circular movement is natural to some
substances other than the four elements and the circular movement is considered more
divine than these four elements (since circular motion is believed to be prior to straight
movement). Aristotle views the universe as two-spheres where the changing region is up to
the sphere of the moon, the earth is in the center surrounded by water, and air and fire
are at the top, beyond which the heavenly bodies are in circular motion and in a realm
without change. There is a separate set of physical laws for each of the two regions,
since they are composed of different types of matter. Aristotle argues that the universe
is not infinite because the universe moves in a circle (as we can see with our eyes if we
watch the stars). If the universe were infinite, it would be moving though an infinite
distance in a finite time, which is impossible. This is an argument employing the method
of reductio ad absurdum (i.e., showing that the premise leads to an absurd conclusion thus
proving the opposite premise must be true). Aristotle claimed also that there was only one
world. He demonstrated this conclusion also using a reductio ad absurdum argument. If
there were more than one world, each world with a center as the natural place for earthy
material to move to and a circumference for fire to move to, then the earth could move
toward any of the centers and fire toward any of the circumferences. Chaos would ensue.
Since we observe order instead of chaos then there must be only one world. Aristotle also
showed that the heavens rotate and that the earth is spherical, stationary and in the
center of the heavenly sphere. In his arguments that the earth is spherical (based on the
circular shadow during eclipse and that different stars are seen from different parts of
the earth), Aristotle's use of observation is in stark contrast to Plato's rejection of
the evidence of the senses. This is seen by some historians as a turning point in science,
marking the beginning of extensive empirical investigations. However, Aristotle's
cosmology has a number of teleological and animistic qualities that distinguish it from
the modern mechanical explanations. While bringing to Greek science a new emphasis on the
value of observation, Aristotle still differs in important ways from modern scientific
practice. For example his observations are used more to persuade his readers of the truth
of his conclusions than as an aid in arriving at his conclusions. Also Aristotle does not
conduct critical experiments with which to test his conclusions. </p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p><b>Kant's Cosmology (1724-1804)</b> - Kant provided the first model of a scientific,
albeit highly speculative and qualitative, cosmology. His cosmology was thoroughly
mechanistic and materialistic, but it makes clear that every cosmology must begin with the
perception of a 'systematic constitution,' that could be viewed as evidence of some sort
of 'grand design'. Although most of Kant's main tenets were mistaken, his work was of
unprecedented scope, made detailed use of physical theory, and contained a number of
fundamental insights. Kant's cosmological explanation takes the form of showing how the
'systematic constitution' arose, by way of Newton's laws of motion and the law of
universal gravitation, from an original chaos. The chaos consists of atoms or particles of
matter spread throughout an infinite space. According to Kant, the original chaos was
unstable: the denser particles begin at once to attract the more tenuous. This is the
explanation of the origin of motion and the formation of bodies, eventually of the
planets. To prevent the universe from becoming one big massive ball Kant claims nature has
still other forces in store which especially evidence themselves when <i>'matter is
diluted into fine particles, whereby they repulse one another and through their conflict
with [the force of] attraction produce that motion which is, so to speak, and enduring
life of nature. Through this repulsive force, which reveals itself in the elasticity of
vapors in the strongly smelling bodies and in the expansion of all spirituous matter and
which is an indisputable phenomenon of nature, the elements sinking toward their points of
attraction become directed side-wise in all sorts of ways and the perpendicular fall
issues in circular motions which surround the center of sinking.'</i> Lateral motion thus
results when attractive and repulsive forces between any two bodies are equal and the one
body, following the path of least resistance, begins to orbit about the other. As this
summary indicates Kant's cosmology was largely qualitative. For example, he nowhere
provides a law, similar to that for attraction, by which the force of repulsion can be
determined. It is also important to note that while Kant's cosmology was naturalistic he
never gave up the attempt to reconcile teleology and mechanism. In his Universal Natural
History he claimed, that the very perfection of the mechanism in terms of which the
development of the universe could be explained was at the same time the guarantee that it
existed for a purpose and was not simply the product of accident and chance.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p><b>Modern Cosmology</b><a href="#Footnote2B" name="Footnote2A"> Footnote2</a> - Modern
relativistic cosmology emerged in the 20th century. A science in a technical sense can
emerge only after its philosophical foundations have been clearly and distinctly laid.
Nevertheless, cosmology, like preceding scientific disciplines, seems to have developed
its philosophical foundation by a largely unconscious process. The philosophical
foundation of a science involves three essential stances; metaphysical, epistemological,
and methodological. These are outlined in Table 1. We define what it means to be
&quot;scientific&quot; as consisting of some choice of a combination of positions held
within each categorical stance: Metaphysics + Epistemology + Methodology. Without this
foundation we do not have a basis for stating 'what it is to be scientific'. The choice of
the specific position under each categorical stance is independent of the specific
position selected in the other categories. In other words the individual positions held
within the metaphysical, epistemological, and methodological triad are mutually
independent choices that are selected without reference to the position held in each of
the other categorical stances. </p>

  <tr>
    <td WIDTH="50%"><b>Metaphysical Stances </b>This stance poses the question; &quot;What

    <p><b>Explanatory Realism</b> - This position adopts as an existence criterion something

    &quot;What are the legitimate sources of scientific knowledge?&quot;</td>
    <td WIDTH="50%"><b>Empiricism</b> - Only information from observational and experimental
    results are acceptable as a source for cosmological theorizing. Scientific knowledge is
    founded in sensory observation. <p><b>Rationalism </b>- It is permissible for cosmologists
    to originate their theoretical efforts in very general ideas about what the universe
    should be like.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td WIDTH="50%"><b>Methodological Stances </b>The question related to this stance is;
    &quot;What are the acceptable procedures for constructing a scientific theory?&quot; </td>
    <td WIDTH="50%"><b>Hypothetico-deductivism (H-D'ism)</b> - Hypotheses are generated on the
    basis of general ideas about the universe, and then the consequences of these hypotheses
    are deduced with the hope that at least some of the consequences involve observational
    possibilities.<p><br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Inductivism</b> - Logical induction is used to produce generalizations and
    extrapolations based on solid observational and experimental information.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><br>
</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p>One of the relatively popular choices among several scientific fields is:
Operationalism + Rationalism + H-D'ism. Another choice that has been identified is:
Operationalism + Empiricism + Inductivism. Perhaps the most typical position of a physical
scientist is: Realism + Empiricism + Inductivism. In the case of modern relativistic
cosmology it was Operationalism + Rationalism + H-D'ism that ended up providing the
philosophical model. The main point is that within science itself there are
inconsistencies between what it means to be scientific from one discipline to the next.
This is important because understanding the philosophical basis for a scientific
interpretation of nature is an essential first step for a rational critique of the
conflict between scientific cosmology and biblical cosmology. </p>

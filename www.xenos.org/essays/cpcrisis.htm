<h1 align="center">Balance in Spiritual Experience:<br>
&quot;Crisis&quot; Versus &quot;Process&quot;</h1>

<h4>By <a href="../personal/gary.htm">Gary DeLashmutt </a></h4>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Christian spiritual experience is a very broad and rich biblical theme. We have been
invited into a personal relationship with Christ--a relationship that can be experienced.
We have been given the gift of the New Covenant--the Holy Spirit who personally
communicates the life of Jesus Christ to us and through us to the world. For these and
other biblical reasons, we are fully justified in both wanting and cultivating a rich
experiential dimension in our relationships with Christ.</p>

<p>But there are dangers on this path which we must be careful to discern and avoid.
Because spiritual experience is by its very nature subjective, it is imperative that our
expectations in this area be formed by scripture. If we set our expectations unbiblically
low, we may experience and demonstrate a Christianity that is lifeless and dishonoring to
the Lord. But if our expectations exceed what is taught in scripture, we may needlessly
disappoint ourselves and also bring the Lord into disrepute because of our weirdness. Let
us consider each of these dangers in turn.</p>

<h3>&quot;Crisis&quot; and &quot;Process&quot;</h3>

<p>&quot;Crisis&quot; is used in this paper to describe the unusual manifestations of
God's presence and activity, including instant or rapid physical and emotional healing,
visions, and being &quot;slain in the Spirit.&quot; Such events are &quot;crises&quot; in
the sense that God does something which is both dramatic and unusual. &quot;Process&quot;
refers to the more subtle work of God in sanctification and ministry. It is a
&quot;process&quot; precisely because it is accomplished gradually and through our
consistent cooperation with God through the normal means of growth. </p>

<p>We can contrast different approaches to spirituality by comparing how much they
emphasize &quot;crisis&quot; and &quot;process.&quot; Charismatic and &quot;third
wave&quot;<a href="#Footnote1B" name="Footnote1A"> Footnote1</a> advocates
regard &quot;crisis&quot; experiences as a normative feature of the Spirit-filled life. In
other words, every Christian who is really walking with God will have dramatic spiritual
experiences on some fairly regular basis. Pentecostal and charismatic theology typically
affirm this by insisting that the &quot;baptism of the Holy Spirit&quot; is manifested by
speaking in tongues, or by insisting that physical healing will always occur if we have
enough faith. While &quot;third wave&quot; theology is more mainstream in these areas,<a href="#Footnote2B" name="Footnote2A"> Footnote2</a> they nevertheless insist
that signs and wonders are normative for the church age.<a href="#Footnote3B" name="Footnote3A"> Footnote3</a> </p>

<p>Non-charismatic advocates, on the other hand, emphasize &quot;process.&quot; Some argue
that God has withdrawn all sign gifts from the church after the New Testament was
completed. Others acknowledge that God still intervenes via &quot;crises,&quot; but less
often than he did during the time of Jesus and the apostles. Still others hold that God
intervenes through &quot;crises&quot; as much as he ever did, but that charismatics
exaggerate the frequency of such experiences in the book of Acts.</p>

<p>We should not take the position that God does not work today through &quot;crisis&quot;
experiences. The Bible, church history, and contemporary Christian experience all affirm
that God can and sometimes does intervene in dramatic ways. But when Christians emphasize
&quot;crisis&quot; as much as or more than &quot;process,&quot; they tend to make some
serious mistakes. We should be aware of these mistakes ourselves, and we should help those
under our leadership steer clear of them.</p>

<h3>The Hermeneutical Problem</h3>

<p>Both charismatic and &quot;third wave&quot; advocates usually draw heavily from the New
Testament narrative and example as they develop their conclusions about normative
Christian spirituality. But this is improper, because there may be unique features in such
accounts that should not be factored into our general conclusions about spirituality.<a href="#Footnote4B" name="Footnote4A"> Footnote4</a> Instead, we should look
primarily to the didactic portions of the New Testament which refer to all Christians.
John Stott's reminder is timely: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is described in Scripture as having happened to others is not necessarily intended
  for us, whereas what is promised to us we should appropriate, and what is commanded us we
  are to obey&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;What is descriptive is valuable (in determining what
  God intends for all Christians) only in so far as it is interpreted by what is
  didactic&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;We must derive our standards of belief and behavior
  from the teaching of the New Testament&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;rather than from the
  practices and experiences which it portrays.<a href="#Footnote5B" name="Footnote5A"> Footnote5</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This material would include those portions of Jesus' teaching which concern the church,
the apostles' teaching in Acts, and most of the pastoral epistles. But the main body of
material would be the epistles written to whole churches or groups of churches.</p>

<p>When we study this body of material, it is clear that they simply do not emphasize
&quot;crisis&quot; experiences as a normative feature in Christian spirituality. Rather,
we find that Christian spirituality is defined primarily as learning to view all things
from the perspective of God's revealed truth, cooperating with God in the transformation
of our moral characters, and practicing sacrificial love toward Christians and
non-Christians.<a href="#Footnote6B" name="Footnote6A"> Footnote6</a> These
passages also encourage us to pursue this spirituality primarily through the
&quot;process&quot; of consistent participation in the &quot;means of
growth&quot;--scripture, prayer, God's discipline, fellowship, and ministry. Of course, we
should do this with an attitude of dependence on God's Spirit to enlighten and motivate
and empower us, because spirituality is not attainable by human will-power. As J. I.
Packer says, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the Spirit works through <i>means</i>--through
  the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;means of grace&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The Spirit shows
  his power in us, not by constantly interrupting our use of these means with visions,
  impressions, or prophecies, which serve up to us ready-made insights on a plate, so to
  speak (such communications come only rarely, and to some believers not at all), but rather
  by making these regular means effective to change us for the better and for the wiser as
  we go along&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Holiness by habit forming (through these means) is
  not self-sanctification through self-effort, but is simply a matter of understanding the
  Spirit's method and then keeping in step with him.<a href="#Footnote7B" name="Footnote7A"> Footnote7</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Evaluating Other Christians' Spirituality By &quot;Crisis&quot; Experiences</h3>

<p>Christian workers must make judgments about the spirituality of other Christians. How
can we help someone to mature spiritually if we don't have a picture of what maturity
looks like and judge that he doesn't fit this picture? How can we do our job of
shepherding people if we don't critically evaluate the message of other spiritual teachers
and leaders who seek to influence them? The truth is that we all have a standard of what
constitutes spiritual maturity, and we all constantly evaluate ourselves and others in
light of this standard. What is important is not that we make such judgments, but that we
have the correct standard (Jn.&nbsp;7:24), and that we judge with a loving and redemptive
attitude.</p>

<p>If we assume that dramatic spiritual experiences should be normative in the Christian
life, we must conclude that those who are not having &quot;crisis&quot; experiences are in
fact sub-standard spiritually. Different charismatic groups express this judgment in
different ways. Some say such people are &quot;missing God's best;&quot; others say they
are not experiencing the &quot;Spirit-filled life.&quot; Third-wave advocates often say
this deficiency is the result of a defective world-view which is excessively naturalistic.
There are, of course, exceptions to this judgment among those sympathetic to charismatic
theology, but they are rare.<a href="#Footnote8B" name="Footnote8A"> Footnote8</a></p>

<p>But &quot;crisis&quot; experiences should never be regarded as a requirement for or
evidence of spiritual vitality or maturity. There is simply no scriptural correlation
between &quot;crisis&quot; experiences and true spirituality. Scripture is replete with
examples of people who experienced God's power in dramatic ways, but who were also
spiritually carnal. Samson, Saul, and Balaam are Old Testament examples; the Corinthian
church is a New Testament example. As mentioned above, the New Testament consistently
describes spiritual maturity in ways that do not necessitate dramatic spiritual
experiences. God can and does work through &quot;crisis&quot; experiences, and we should
thankfully receive all authentic working of God through this means. But we should avoid
the inviting but erroneous conclusion that they prove the spirituality of the recipient.
Consider what J. I. Packer says in this regard. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That, in God's mercy, momentous post-conversion experiences come to some Christians,
  bringing assurance, liberty of heart, new spiritual joy and energy, with new power for
  life and witness, is beyond doubt. These, however, seem to be the particular discretionary
  dealings of a gracious heavenly Father with his individual children. They are not
  universal requirements, not prescribed patterns of experience for all, not hoops through
  which every Christian must try to jump. Those who have had no momentous `second
  experience,' therefore, should not see themselves as necessarily inferior to those who
  have been thus blessed. History confirms that some of God's finest servants have been
  enriched this way, while others, equally fine, have not.<a href="#Footnote9B" name="Footnote9A"> Footnote9</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because charismatic and &quot;third wave&quot; groups include &quot;crisis&quot;
experiences in their picture of spiritual maturity, they inevitably have a divisive
effect. I say &quot;inevitably&quot; not because all charismatics and &quot;third
wave&quot; Christians are nasty and mean-spirited. Some no doubt are; many are not at all.
But the fact remains that they have included in their picture of spirituality something
which should not be there, and they must (if they are to be consistent) conclude that
those who lack such experiences must be seriously lacking in their Christian lives. No
matter how nastily or kindly this conclusion is communicated, it is still divisive because
it puts Christians in the &quot;unspiritual&quot; category who do not belong there.<a href="#Footnote10B" name="Footnote10A"> Footnote10</a></p>

<h3>Seeking &quot;Crisis&quot; Experiences</h3>

<p>If we view &quot;crisis&quot; experiences as a means to or evidence of spirituality, we
will tend to seek them--just as we will tend to seek biblical knowledge or character
development or sacrificial love for the same reason. But there are several dangers in
seeking dramatic spiritual experiences.</p>

<p>It is not necessarily wrong to ask God to grant us a dramatic experience. Moses
evidently asked God for this in Ex.&nbsp;33:18, when he cried &quot;Show me your
glory!&quot; And God answered his request--although in a diminished way so that Moses
wouldn't be killed! But, as Packer said above, God sovereignly decides when to intervene
in a &quot;crisis&quot; manner. He has not promised in his Word to do this at our bidding.
We are free to ask God to intervene in this way. It is also important that we truly
believe that he can intervene in this way. We should beware of drifting into a mentality
which expects God to do only that which is humanly explainable. We should also freely
rejoice and thank God when he does <i>genuinely</i> intervene in this way in our own
lives, or in others' lives. Something is wrong if we cannot do this. But it is never
healthy to insist, or even to expect, that God must work this way in a given situation.
Instead, we should humbly submit our requests to God and then trust his sovereign wisdom,
realizing that he may well decline such requests for his own good reasons.</p>

<p>Sometimes God denies such requests because he wants our faith to mature, and such
maturity requires that our faith be tested by adversity (1&nbsp;Pet.&nbsp;1:6,7;
Jas.&nbsp;1:2-4; Rom.&nbsp;5:3,4). Especially in a culture like ours which expects a
&quot;quick fix&quot; for all of our problems, it is tempting to expect God to answer our
requests for something dramatic. This is why the New Testament letters emphasize the
development of perseverance and endurance<a href="#Footnote11B" name="Footnote11A"> Footnote11</a>, while they say little or nothing about seeking
&quot;crisis&quot; experiences from God. Packer is surely right when he says, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The immaturity and childish egoism that infect our culture claim their victims among
  Christians too. Symptoms of these defects appear in the all-too-common tendency of modern
  Christians to undervalue the natural and the ordinary. There are just too many people who
  want every problem to be solved by an immediate miracle, a display of the supernatural, a
  wonderful providence that will change everything. I think that is a sign not of great
  faith, but of great immaturity.<a href="#Footnote12B" name="Footnote12A">
  Footnote12</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our part is to patiently and consistently pursue his priorities for our lives, trusting
that as we do so God will gradually transform us more and more into Christ's likeness. And
this is the most important thing--not whether or not we have been given dramatic
experiences along the way.</p>

<p>Seeking &quot;crisis&quot; experiences often leads to a reliance on subjective
impressions for guidance rather than relying primarily on rational application of
scripture. While we should realize that God sometimes guides us through intuition and
other subjective means, we can never be certain that this guidance is from God unless it
conforms to scripture. Therefore, all claims of such guidance should be tentative, and we
should never rely on subjective impressions (no matter how dramatic) as our primary means
of guidance. Richard Lovelace cautions us against this excess: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The common denominator of all of these aberrations is reliance on subjective experience
  divorced from the objective control of reason and the written Word of
  God&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Christians who block out their minds in the process of
  attuning themselves to the Spirit are trying to replace an essential human attribute by
  the gift of the Spirit which is meant to transform that faculty, not replace it. To
  relinquish the guiding and superintending function of the intellect in our experience
  seems pious at first, but in the end this course dehumanizes us by turning us into either
  dependent robots waiting to be programmed by the Spirit's guidance or whimsical
  enthusiasts blown about by our hunches and emotions. God has provided us with the ability
  to gather information and to make rational decisions in light of this information in
  conformity with his revealed will in Scripture. Any method of guidance which habitually
  detours around reason is crippling and dehumanizing.<a href="#Footnote13B" name="Footnote13A"> Footnote13</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, Packer cautions: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Charismatic preoccupation with experience observably inhibits the long, hard
  theological and ethical reflection for which the New Testament letters
  call&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Looking for a prophecy (supposedly a direct word from God)
  when difficult issues arise, rather than embracing the hard grind of prayerful study and
  analysis, is a tendency that sometimes obtrudes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<a href="#Footnote14B" name="Footnote14A"> Footnote14</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seeking &quot;crisis&quot; experiences may also make us more vulnerable to spiritual
deception. The very appetite for dramatic spiritual experiences usually militates against
a the watchful and objective discernment that is so crucial for evaluating experiences and
those who claim to be able to give them. Yet the Bible insists that we cultivate just such
a mentality if we are to avoid deception--because counterfeits abound. Commenting on
John's command to &quot;test the spirits&quot; in 1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:1-3, Francis
Schaeffer gives us this warning: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;When a prophet or a spirit comes to you, the test of whether he
  should be accepted or rejected is not the experience that the spirit or prophet gives you.
  Nor is it the strength of the emotion which the spirit or prophet gives you. Nor is it any
  special outward manifestations that the spirit or the prophet may give to you. The basis
  of accepting the spirit or prophet--<i>and the basis of Christian fellowship</i>--is
  Christian doctrine. There is no other final test. Satan can counterfeit and he will. I am
  not speaking against emotion in itself. Of course there should be emotion. I am saying
  that you cannot trust your emotions or the strength of your emotions or the boost your
  emotions give you when you stand in the presence of the spirit or the prophet. This does
  not prove for one moment whether he is from God, or the Devil, or whether the emotions are
  simply from within yourself.<a href="#Footnote15B" name="Footnote15A">

<p>We should especially beware when people criticize us for our insistence on objective
testing by telling us we are intellectually prideful, or that we may be quenching or
blaspheming the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Seeking &quot;crisis&quot; experiences sometimes leads to faking such experiences in
order to be viewed as spiritual. This is especially likely when the group has made
&quot;crisis&quot; experiences an expectation. I personally know several Christians who
claimed to have had overwhelming experiences from God (healings, tongues, visions,
prophecies, exorcisms, etc.) who later acknowledged they did not. They made this claim
because they were &quot;going along with the crowd.&quot; It had become the &quot;in&quot;
thing to have an experience and they didn't want to be left out. This is often not
intentional in the sense that the person deliberately tried to deceive others.<a href="#Footnote16B" name="Footnote16A"> Footnote16</a> It is understandable to
get caught up in the emotions of the group and to seek the acceptance of one's peers--but
this is clearly not a healthy situation.<a href="#Footnote17B" name="Footnote17A"> Footnote17</a> Christians who pursue spiritual maturity through
&quot;process&quot; usually avoid this. While they may experience God working in a
dramatic way and rejoice in it, they know that a stable and consistent walk is a more
reliable indicator of maturity.</p>

<p>Lastly, seeking &quot;crisis&quot; experiences can lead to deep disappointment when we
don't receive the experiences we were seeking. Many Christians who have a
&quot;crisis&quot; orientation walk away from Christ altogether when God stops working in
this way in their lives. This is the tragic result of setting expectations which were
unrealistically (unbiblically) high. If we focus primarily on following the Lord as a
&quot;process,&quot; we will have a rich experiential life with him (see below). There may
even be occasional dramatic experiences--but we should see these as a bonus in our walks
with God, not as a requisite for them.</p>

<h3>Affirming Healthy Spiritual Experience</h3>

<p>There is a real danger, when confronting any doctrinal imbalance, to overreact and
become imbalanced in the opposite direction. Church history contains ample illustrations
of this &quot;pendulum swing&quot; strategy by which Satan wins a double victory. For
example, much of the American Protestant church was lured into theological apostasy in the
early part of this century. Their &quot;social gospel&quot; rejected many essential
doctrines, and orthodox Christians were correct in condemning this. But they also reacted
against virtually all social ministry because of its &quot;guilt by association&quot; with
theological liberalism. The result has been a disastrous separation of evangelism from
social ministries which has marred the witness of the evangelical church.</p>

<p>The same overreaction is common in the area of spiritual experience. When we see an
unbiblical emphasis on &quot;crisis&quot; experiences, we should criticize this distortion
and do what we can to correct it. But at the same time, we should be keenly aware of our
vulnerability to overreact against all spiritual experience. The result will be a
lifeless, sterile activistic orthodoxy that is every bit as ugly as the distortion we
reacted against. Francis Schaeffer's warning on this danger should be heeded by all of us:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;in meeting the challenges of the new super-spirituality we must
  not overreact. I'm desperately afraid of overreaction, &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;(of)
  treating Christianity as if it were only a system. God is there, and we must be in a
  living relationship to Him. Consequently, as we see the new super-spirituality, the danger
  is that we will overreact and underemphasize the work of the Holy
  Spirit&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;When a group begins to overemphasize the work of the Holy
  Spirit at the expense of the full content of Scripture or to underemphasize the status of
  the intellect&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;, the danger is to talk less and less about the
  Holy Spirit for fear someone will confuse us with this other group. Instead, a Christian
  must have the courage to &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;stress (this area) in (its) proper
  relationship to the whole of Scripture&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;In the present instance,
  we must properly stress spirituality&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a balance not just of
  abstract doctrine, but a balance to be lived, by God's grace, by the individual and by the
  group&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Christianity is not only intellectual, nor is it only your
  cultural responsibility&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Christianity is the reality of communion
  with God in the present life; it is the understanding that there is the indwelling Holy
  Spirit; it is the understanding that there is the moment-by-moment empowering of the Holy
  Spirit&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It is the understanding that the fruit of the Spirit is
  meant to be something real to <i>all</i> Christians. It is the understanding that prayer
  is real and not just a devotional exercise. Indeed we must not overreact
  to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;super-spirituality, but we must stress that
  Christ&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;means us to affirm life and not negate life. Such is the
  ideal. May God show us the living balance and help us to live, by His grace, in that
  balance.<a href="#Footnote18B" name="Footnote18A"> Footnote18</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What can we expect to experience of God's presence if we focus on &quot;process&quot;
rather than &quot;crisis?&quot; We can expect the abundant life which Jesus promised, and
which the apostles describe to us in their letters. We can expect the normal work of the
Holy Spirit in our lives, which is a rich life indeed. As we pursue developing a
transformed mind, the Spirit will illuminate our minds (sometimes quite strikingly) with
insight about the significance and application of biblical truth to our lives
(1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;2:12; Eph.&nbsp;1:17,18). He will also recall to our memory truths we
have studied in situations where we need those truths. These moments of illumination are
precious to us. As we pursue a transformed character, the Spirit will touch different
areas of our lives at different times, convicting us of our sins and urging us to turn to
God for help and change (Rom.&nbsp;8:14; Gal.&nbsp;5:18). This care is a wonderful and
deeply personal aspect of our relationships with God. As we pursue a life of sacrificial
love, the Spirit motivates us to serve others, at times providing us with guidance about
people he wants us to serve and ways he wants us to serve them. He also empowers us to
serve, especially in the areas of our spiritual gifting, so that we experience a sense of
awe that God is working through us and deeply affecting other lives. We can experience the
fulfillment of Jesus' promise that it is deeply fulfilling to give our lives away to
others for his sake (Acts&nbsp;20:35; Jn.&nbsp;13:17; Jn.&nbsp;12:25). As we step out in
faith to share Christ, we can experience the empowering of the Holy Spirit which Jesus
promised his disciples in Acts 1:8. And we can join in with God and the angels in
rejoicing when one of our non-Christian friends or family members comes to Christ
(Lk.&nbsp;15:7,10). As we persevere in private and corporate prayer, we will experience
(sometimes intensely) personal intimacy with the Lord as the Spirit bears witness to our
spirit that we are children of God&quot; (Rom.&nbsp;8:15,16; Gal.&nbsp;4:6;
Jn.&nbsp;14:21,23).</p>

<p>As we continue to trust God and walk by the Spirit, we can experience the joy and peace
and hope of God in increasing measure and consistency (Gal.&nbsp;5:22; Phil.&nbsp;4:6,7;
Rom.&nbsp;14:17; 15:4,13). However, this does not mean we will &quot;break the spiritual
sound barrier&quot; after which we remain in a state of bliss. This view of spirituality
is more Buddhist than Christian. There will be &quot;dark nights of the soul&quot; when
God seems to have hidden his face from us--but if we press on we will emerge with deeper
confidence in his faithfulness and goodness. There will be times of deep pain as the
battle against Satan presses in upon us--but if we stand firm we will see the Lord win
victories over him. There will be periods of deep disappointment and dismay as God reveals
new depths of our sinfulness to us--but if we cling to his grace we will also experience
his power to transform us. There will suffering--including additional sufferings because
we have chosen to follow Christ--but if we endure we will also experience God's comfort
and strengthening in surprising and deeply personal ways (2&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;1:6). This
combination of negative and positive experiences is part and parcel of the normal
Christian life. Knowing Christ involves experiencing <i>both</i> the fellowship of his
sufferings and the power of his resurrection (Phil.&nbsp;3:10,11; 2 Cor.&nbsp;4:8-11;
6:4-10). We should affirm this expectation in our own lives, and we should model and
communicate it to those Christians within our spheres of influence.</p>

<p>God urges us to view this life as a preparation for the next life, rather than
expecting this life to fulfill all our hopes. Our culture has taught us to expect complete
happiness in this life, and much Christian &quot;triumphalism&quot; reflects the infection
of this unbiblical expectation.<a href="#Footnote19B" name="Footnote19A">
Footnote19</a> In this life we receive the &quot;first fruits&quot; of the Spirit, the
&quot;down-payment&quot; of all that he will give us in the life to come
(Rom.&nbsp;8:23-25; Eph.&nbsp;1:14). Indeed, some of these works of the Spirit are intense
and wonderful, but they are given by God to remind us that the best is yet to come, so
that we will press on in the battle with hope in our hearts. We should run the race with
endurance just as Jesus did &quot;who <i>for the joy set before him</i> endured the cross,
despising the shame&quot; (Heb.&nbsp;12:2). We have the brief opportunity in this life to
walk by faith and not by sight (2&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;5:7). The time is coming when faith will
not be needed ever again because we will be in God's presence. We have the opportunity in
this life to demonstrate our commitment to Christ by suffering for him (Phil.&nbsp;1:29).
The time is coming when God will wipe away every tear and more than make up for anything
we have suffered for his sake (2&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;4:17). Let us seize this opportunity and
serve the Lord with our whole hearts!</p>

<p>&quot;Third wave&quot; theology refers to the theological position held by John Wimber
in his books <i>Power Evangelism</i> (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1986) and <i>Power
Healing</i> (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1987), Wimber's &quot;Vineyard&quot; church
movement, and others like C. Peter Wagner in <i>The Third Wave of the Holy Spirit</i> (Ann
Arbor: Servant Publications, 1988). The basic view is that God has poured out his Holy
Spirit in three &quot;waves&quot; during the twentieth century: during the Pentecostal
movement at the beginning of the century, during the Charismatic movement in the middle of
the century, and now at the end of the century through movements like Vineyard.</p>

<p><a href="#Footnote2A" name="Footnote2B">Footnote2</a></p>

<p>Although there are problems here with Wimber's theology.
&quot;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;when Wimber argues that if forgiveness is preached and
not all receive it because of unbelief, we nevertheless go on preaching it, and we do
likewise with healing, he is in fact arguing that healing and forgiveness are parallel and
dependent on the same condition. This point was picked up in an Australian interview:
`When asked if he (Wimber) would be open about the small probability of healing, he
declined. He wants to encourage people to put their faith in God and call upon him for
healing. He wants people to know that God can heal and wants to heal and therefore to ask
expectantly. He paralleled this to salvation/forgiveness. He said that we do not say to
people that they only have a chance of being saved. We say that God can save and wants to
save and so we encourage people to put their faith in God and call for forgiveness. Such a
confusion of categories is appalling.' It seems beyond doubt that Wimber is guilty of
contradiction.&quot; Thomas A. Smail and Nigel Wright, <i>The Love of Power or the Power
of Love</i> (Minnesota: Bethany House Publishers, 1994), p.&nbsp;45. The quote is from the
transcript of Jensen and Payne's interview, <i>John Wimber: Friend or Foe?</i> p. 9.</p>

<p><a href="#Footnote3A" name="Footnote3B">Footnote3</a></p>

<p>&quot;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;we will especially expect to see God's reign through
signs and wonders triumphing over the kingdom of the evil one, like the Christians of the
first and second centuries did.&quot; Don Williams, <i>Signs, Wonders, and the Kingdom of
God</i> (Ann Arbor: Vine Books, 1989), p.&nbsp;136. &quot;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the
New Testament authors assume that the churches are sufficiently concerned with miracles
and that miracles were a regular occurrence&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it is appropriate
for us to ask whether there is some reason why we are unlike the New Testament church in
this regard.&quot; Wayne Grudem, <i>Power and Truth</i> (no publication information
given), p.&nbsp;27.</p>

<p><a href="#Footnote4A" name="Footnote4B">Footnote4</a></p>

<p>For example, the manifestation of tongues in Acts 2,8,10,19 seem primarily to signal
the transition from the Old Covenant to the New (Acts 2,19), and to signal that believing
Gentiles are equal members of the church along with believing Jews (Acts 8,10; 11:16,17).
There is evidence that the exceptional frequency of Jesus' miracles were to fulfill
prophecy concerning his Messiahship (Matt.&nbsp;11:3-5), and that the apostles were
enabled to perform miracles with unique frequency in order to validate their message as
authoritative (Heb.&nbsp;2:4; 2&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;12:12). One need not conclude from this
that God never works in this way through the church today, but one would conclude that
such working is probably not as frequent as it was during Jesus' and the apostles'
ministries.</p>

<p><a href="#Footnote6A" name="Footnote6B">Footnote6</a></p>

<p>See, for example, John's emphasis in 1 John on doctrinal fidelity (2:24; 4:1-3;14,15),
moral obedience (1:5-2:6) and loving others (2:7-11; 4:7-21). John purposefully defines
spirituality in these terms in order to combat a Gnostic emphasis on subjective
experience. Paul's letters to Timothy and Titus likewise urge them to emphasize doctrinal
understanding (1&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;1:3,4; 3:2,9; 4:6,13,15; 6:3,20; 2&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;1:13,14;
2:8,15,24; 3:14-4:4; Titus&nbsp;1:9,13,14; 2:1,2,7), moral character
(1&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;2:2; 3:2-12; 4:12; 6:11; 2&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;2:3-6,19-22; 3:16;
Titus&nbsp;1:6-8; 2:2-10; 3:1,2), and love manifested practically through good deeds
(1&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;1:5; 2:10,15; 3:4,12; 4:12; 5:10; 6:11,18; 2&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;1:7;
2:22,24,25; 3:10; Titus&nbsp;2:2,4,14; 3:8,14). Jesus' primary concerns for the seven
churches in Rev.&nbsp;2,3 reveals the same three foci: pure doctrine (2:2,6,13-15,20,24;
3:8), moral purity (2:14,20-22), and love (2:4,5,19). The references to these three
emphases from the other epistles are too numerous to mention.</p>

<p>J. I. Packer, <i>Keep In Step With The Spirit</i> (Old Tappan, New Jersey: Fleming H.
Revell Co., 1984), pp.&nbsp;109,110. One of Packer's main criticisms of charismatic
theology is what he calls <i>super-supernaturalism</i>:
&quot;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that way of affirming the supernatural which exaggerates
its discontinuity with the natural. Reacting against&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;versions of
Christianity which play down the supernatural and so do not expect to see God at work, the
super-supernaturalist constantly expects miracles of all sorts--striking demonstrations of
God's presence and power--and is happiest when he sees God acting contrary to the nature
of things&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;For God to proceed slowly and by natural means is to
him a disappointment, almost a betrayal. But his undervaluing of the natural, regular, and
ordinary shows him to be romantically immature&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Charismatic
thinking tends to treat glossalalia, in which mind and tongue are deliberately and
systematically disassociated, as the paradigm case of spiritual activity and to expect all
God's work in and around his children to involve similar discontinuity with the ordinary
regularities of the created world.&quot; (pp.&nbsp;193,194)</p>

<p>For example, John White argues that such manifestations are common only during periods
of revival, and that even during revivals not all spiritually-minded Christians will
experience dramatic manifestations. &quot;My aim is not to promote manifestations so much
as to encourage us all to be open to what God is doing and to what I believe he wants to
do in sending revival&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the experience itself is neither here nor
there, except as being an evidence that God is moving in revival. Those Christians whose
spiritual progress has been quiet and steady may never, even where the power of the Holy
Spirit is present, be subject to any manifestation.&quot; John White, <i>When The Spirit
Comes With Power</i> (Downers Grove: InterVarsity Press, 1988), pp. 101,102,104.</p>

<p>&quot;Group pressure is tyrannical at the best of times and never more so than when the
group in question believes itself to be superspiritual and finds the evidence of its
members' spirituality in their power to perform along approved lines. Inevitably, peer
pressure to perform (hands raised, hands outstretched, glossalalia, prophecy) is strong in
charismatic circles; inevitably, too, the moment one starts living to the group and its
expectations rather than to the Lord, one is enmeshed in a new legalistic bondage, whereby
from yet another angle Christian maturity is threatened.&quot; J. I. Packer, <i>Keep In

<p>&quot;Triumphalism&quot; refers to the expectation of participating in Christ's victory
to the extent that we forget that we are still part of a deeply fallen world, and that our
role is to model Jesus' first coming as a suffering servant. Paul rebukes the Corinthians
for this attitude in 1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;4:8-13, using the image of a Roman general's
&quot;triumphal procession.&quot; The Corinthian Christians expected the Christian life to
be like that of the Roman general--to receive public praise and honor and experience the
good life. But Paul says his (and our) role is to be like that of the conquered prisoners
who are condemned to die in the coliseum! Charismatic and &quot;third wave&quot; theology
has often been critiqued for its triumphalism in the area of spiritual experience.</p>

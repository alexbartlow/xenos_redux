<h3>From the book, <a href="../books/wiv.htm">Walking in Victory</a></h3>
<p class="style1">As we have seen, self-focus can be seen in the category of walking according 
  to the flesh, especially when we focus on ourselves as we were in Adam. This 
  is a position which will cause consternation on the part of some modern readers. 
  Today in our culture, focusing on ourselves is viewed as the key to happiness 
  and health. Today, many people believe they will solve their problems by &quot;centering&quot; 
  themselves, or &quot;gaining a sense of self.&quot; </p>

<p class="style1">According to these theories, my quest should be to find my true self and liberate that
self from the layers of repression and abuse heaped on me by others. The key is to
discover my inner child--the true me--and become my own parent. Only by attacking my
shame-based upbringing will I finally throw off the negative labeling and repressive rules
holding me down (the repressive parent within) and find freedom to express my creativity
and my &quot;true&quot; feelings. I need to champion the inner child so I can get in touch
with my feelings which have been shamed and denied to me for so long. Only then will I
finally differentiate my ego from the undifferentiated ego-mass of my family of origin. </p>

<p class="style1">These and related ideas have grown out of a combination of three streams of thinking
which have fused into a mighty river with the virtual status of religion in our culture.
The first tributary was the family systems school of psychoanalysis. The second was the
recovery movement and its daughter, the codependency movement. Finally, these have been
joined by what we might call New Age selfism, or radical individualism. </p>

<p class="style1">Although there are many professionals who would reject such theories, popular culture
seems to be reaching a level of agreement rarely, if ever, seen before in this century.
For example, author John Bradshaw, who has been called the high priest of inner child
therapy has written a number of books which have all spent time on the New York Times best
seller list, often as number 1 for months at a time. These are some of the most popular
non-fiction books written in recent history. [I draw my descriptions of Bradshaw's
material primarily from the following two works. John Bradshaw, <i>Creating Love: The Next
Great Stage of Growth</i>, (New York:, Bantam Books) 1992 and <i>Healing the Shame that
Binds You</i>, (Deerfield Beech, CA: Health Communications, Inc. 1988)].</p>

<h3 class="style1">Biblical and Critical Assessment</h3>

<p class="style1">Christian thinkers are confused about these therapeutic suggestions. On one side is the
observation that some people, especially victims of acute abuse as children, seem to
forget sections of their early lives, or idealize a past which is known to have been
horrible. This is usually a sign of repression or denial; defense mechanisms which can
threaten people's ability to stay in touch with reality and to relate to others honestly.
Those who are reeling from painful abuse in childhood may live in a numbed and unemotional
state, or their lives may be filled with irrational, displaced rage or anxiety. Only the
most extreme Christian leaders would deny that such denial states exist. </p>

<p class="style1">On the other hand, there are developments in this field that alarm most evangelical
thinkers. Today it seems, not only the severely abused, but virtually everyone is
considered a trauma victim on one level or another. What may have been needed for some
extreme cases of dissociation now is believed to be the key to everyone's life. Yet these
recently discovered therapeutic or self-help procedures are sometimes suspicious. </p>

<p class="style1">Thoughtful evangelicals today worry that what began as a legitimate therapy for certain
victims may be becoming a fad which puts self and negative past experiences at the center
of personal growth. Christians have been quick to adapt the thinking of secular and New
Age teachers, like Bradshaw to the Christian therapeutic market. Re-parenting theories now
turn out to be the crux of Jesus' teaching as well as the plumb-line by which churches and
teachers are judged. Yet several searching questions can be asked of self-restructuring
and family systems theorists: 
<ol class="style1">
  <ol>
    <li><b>Are inner child and parental shame theories biblical?</b> It would 
      be wrong to claim the Bible has to mention something before it can be trusted. 
      The Bible doesn't mention bulimia, but that doesn't mean there's no such 
      thing. On the other hand, if freedom from shame induced by my parents is 
      the key to growth, not just for the severely abused, but for virtually everyone, 
      how did people get along for so many centuries without this knowledge? Bradshaw 
      argues that western culture just began to awaken from its patriarchal trance 
      at the time of the American and French revolution, and that most of our 
      important realizations have occurred since World War II! Is it possible 
      that a discovery made only in the 1960's and 70's by largely secular and 
      New Age thinkers is the key to personal growth for most or all people? If 
      so, what good is the Bible--a &quot;revelation&quot; which completely missed 
      this central truth? </li>
    <li><b>Many of the definitions given for &quot;shaming&quot; are so broad 
      they seem to disallow virtually all parental discipline, and even the categories 
      of good and evil.</b> Some authors, including evangelicals, have championed 
      definitions of illegitimate &quot;shaming&quot; such as &quot;any statement 
      which says there's something wrong with you.&quot; How can this definition 
      from a recent evangelical book be reconciled with the fact that there <i>is</i> 
      something wrong with us? How would Jesus fare in the face of such definitions? 
      He said the world hated him because he testified that their deeds were evil. 
      (John 7:7) His sermon decrying the Pharisees in Matthew 23 would apparently 
      be shaming and labeling of the worst sort. He also warned that he did not 
      come to call the righteous, but sinners. (Matthew 9:13) Is there still a 
      place for admitting sin without feeling we are either shaming ourselves 
      or being shamed? If not, Christ has nothing to offer us. </li>
    <li><b>Is it appropriate to view ourselves as more or less ideal when we were 
      pre-school children?</b> Isn't the notion that &quot;I have to champion 
      the true person I was as a child,&quot; based on the belief that people 
      begin good and become bad because of repressive parenting? Bradshaw expressly 
      affirms that this is the basis for his theories. But how does this theory 
      accord with passages like Proverbs 22:15 &quot;Foolishness is bound up in 
      the heart of a child; The rod of discipline will remove it far from him?&quot; 
      Such a statement sounds like the <i>antithesis</i> of modern inner-child 
      theory. So, too, does Paul's boast that &quot;When I was a child, I used 
      to speak as a child, think as a child, reason as a child; when I became 
      a man, I did away with childish things.&quot; (I Corinthians 13:11) The 
      Bible teaches that children are born fallen and need to have their anti-social 
      selfishness brought under control through training and loving discipline. 
      Children view themselves as the center of the universe and think everyone 
      should cater to their feelings. They can't tell the difference between their 
      feelings and reality. Many Christian thinkers wonder whether modern theory 
      is suggesting that this is the ideal we should all seek. </li>
    <li><b>Beneath the shame theories in the secular market is the unproved assumption 
      that all shame feelings originate from outside myself.</b> Authors like 
      Bradshaw decry the biblical notion of innate sinfulness as the worst sort 
      of paternalistic negative conditioning. He is adamant that the shaming voices 
      within are those of our persons of origin--our parents. But even if this 
      is true <i>sometimes</i>, how do we know shame isn't also native to the 
      fallen human condition? <b>When Adam hid under a bush, it wasn't from Eve, 
      but from God.</b> When we dare to assume powers that are not ours, including 
      the right to be our own gods, we feel unavoidable hard feelings, especially 
      when confronted with the true owner of those powers and titles--the God 
      of the universe. This feeling, so universal and unavoidable, is shame. Why 
      look only to our outer environment for the source of shame instead of realizing 
      that much of our shame comes from the inner knowledge that we are sinners?    </li>
    <li><b>According to inner child theorists, the key to release from shame is 
      entering into my own pain and rage.</b> By finally feeling in a deep way 
      my own feelings rather than the feelings of my parents, I differentiate 
      my ego from the ego-mass of my family. But this theory is not proven. Some 
      people appear to dwell on their pain and rage in a way that is quite destructive. 
      If we compiled a list of passages in the Bible which teach on the need to 
      enter more deeply into our suffering and pain and we compared it to a list 
      of passages teaching on the importance of gratitude, thankfulness and worship, 
      how would the lists compare? Isn't it true that, according to the Bible, 
      the emphasis for most people should be on developing appreciation for what 
      God has done, or will do for us, not dwelling on our misfortunes? At the 
      risk of being diagnosed as being &quot;in denial&quot; I would point out 
      that even verses on the role of pain and suffering focus more on how to 
      endure and respond to pain than on any need to &quot;enter into&quot; it. 
      Such an emphasis need not imply that Christians should practice denial. 
      Paul, Christ and others in Scripture acknowledged they felt pain. It is 
      rather a call to recognize the balance in Scripture, which is heavily weighted 
      in the direction of our need to resist our native negativity, lack of gratitude 
      and self-centeredness. </li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p class="style1">Christians have to think about themselves, just like everyone else. But there is such a
thing as self-absorption in the negative sense, and this is a form of setting our minds on
the things of the flesh. There may be certain people who need to focus on themselves and
their past episodes of abuse for a period of time. The rationale for this is that only
when they reach a greater level of resolution will they be able to leave such things in
the past for good. But for most people most of the time, God wants us to be liberated from
a self-centered focus, and develop a Christ-centered focus. </p>

<h3><a href="../personal/den.htm">Dennis McCallum</a></h3>
<hr>

<p><i><span class="style1"><b>Note:</b> When this paper was presented to the combined 
  leadership and staff of Xenos (about 400 people) in the fall of 1993, it immediately 
  precipitated a division in the church. Xenos, already suffering division two 
  months earlier, could not agree on the direction of the church. Finally, the 
  elders called on Senior Pastor Dennis McCallum to articulate what he saw as 
  the correct vision for Xenos. Particularly important issues at the time included 
  the place of leadership in the church (Xenos has historically been very loose, 
  almost anarchical in its polity) and how to view leaders and workers who have 
  been &quot;wounded&quot; at the hands of fellow Christians. After revising the 
  paper with the elders, McCallum presented it. A month later, the leaders voted 
  by an 85-percent majority to confirm the elders' direction. In all, over 1,300 
  people left Xenos during this period, reducing the church from just under 4,000 
  to just over 2,500. Because most of those leaving went to other evangelical 
  churches more in accord with their own views, Xenos leaders today feel both 
  those leaving and Xenos are better off, because we are more cohesive in our 
  direction and philosophy of ministry.</span></i> </p>

<h2 class="style1"><a name="today"> </a></h2>

<h2 class="style1"><big>Our Vision Today</big></h2>
<p class="style1"><big>Our vision for advancing in the cause of Christ today 
  should still, as it has in the past, center around the formation, nature and 
  composition of our work force. Xenos has always been viewed as a church with 
  an extraordinary work force. However, today the values which have brought us 
  this far are not as clear as they should be, and a general sense of confusion 
  has settled over the church. Today, we have to decide whether we want a work 
  force that is divided, demoralized and immature, or a work force whose way of 
  life reflects godly values and the effectiveness that comes with those values. 
  Our future success as a house-church planting movement depends on these values.</big></p>
<p class="style1"><big><b>At the heart of our vision today is our work force.</b> We believe the Lord would have our church set about the task of building up 
  a godly work force which can do his bidding. This work force is not the same 
  as our leadership, but it should include all our leaders. In addition, there 
  are those who are Christian models&#151;examples of mature and righteous living, 
  perhaps without the gifting or suitability for leadership. These people may 
  be involved in prayer ministries, healing ministries or service. They live the 
  same values we want modeled by the leaders and have gained maturity and experience 
  in serving God. Therefore, they should be considered a part of our committed 
  force of servants of the Lord. </big></p>
<p class="style1"><big>An authentic servant force of the right sort is a potent 
  tool in the hands of the Lord. Whether winning the lost, serving the poor, planting 
  churches or doing foreign mission work, nothing will accomplish these aspects 
  of our mission more than a godly and mature work force. The consensus of the 
  church also arises from this work force, and all sense of vision and unity emanate 
  from this group. Committed servants draw motivation and edification from being 
  with like-minded people. When we are &quot;intent on the same purpose and united 
  in spirit,&quot; we experience fellowship that is nourishing and refreshing. 
  The mission of Xenos is well known. We now need the quality work force to carry 
  it out. As Watchman Nee says in <i>The Normal Christian Worker</i>, &quot;It's 
  not the method but the man that matters.&quot; </big></p>
<p class="style1"><big>Today the elders are setting out to establish a <a href="../admin/steam.htm">Servant 
  Team</a> made up of those who will take upon themselves the burden of following 
  the Lord at the highest level. These are Christians from all ministries who 
  understand what God wants, and who have denied self to accomplish his will. 
  </big> 
<p class="style1"><big><b>Behind the servant team is the central leadership of 
  the church</b> - The upper leadership of our church is the elders and the upper-level 
  staff. Our leadership needs to be strong&#151;confident that they are obeying 
  God's will for our church, and unapologetic for their direction. Confusion and 
  lack of certainty or agreement are not signs of humility. Jesus was never confused 
  or uncertain, but he was humble. We should put away any notion that decisive, 
  strong leadership is arrogant leadership, because the church will be crippled 
  by such postmodern notions. The central leadership and staff should seek to 
  support the Servant Team as they pursue their ministries. They should also join 
  with existing Servant Team members to facilitate the raising up of new Servant 
  Team members.</big> 
<p class="style1"><big>At the same time, the central leadership should provide 
  for and manage programs that provide specialized ministries, such as children's 
  ministries, missions or ministry to the poor. They will not be concerned in 
  the first place with the size of our church, but with establishing our work 
  force, upgrading the quality of the work force and providing a good environment 
  for growth to those who want it.</big></p>
<p class="style1"><big>Stated succinctly, this is how we see God's vision for 
  our church: </big></p>
<blockquote class="style1">  
  <p><i><b><big>&quot;Xenos should set out to build a highly trained, 
    sophisticated, caring, leadable, cohesive, committed, and flexible force of 
    Christian servants all operating for the right motives most of the time-- 
    namely, serving the Lord and doing his will.&quot;</big></b></i></p>

<hr>
<span class="style1"><a name="detailed"> 
</a></span>
<h2 class="style1"><a name="detailed"><big>Detailed Explanation</big></a></h2> 
<p class="style1"><big>This is how we understand the development of our work 
  force in more detail. By examining the vision statement above, you can see key 
  phrases and terms defined below: </big> 
<ul class="style1">
  <li><big><b>They must be highly trained and sophisticated</b>. 
    We cannot accomplish our mission today with a work force that is ignorant 
    or simplistic. Xenos has demonstrated particular strength reaching thinking 
    students and adults. We are determined to continue this emphasis by keeping 
    a strong focus on the truth of the Word of God. The need for discernment has 
    never been greater. Training is particularly important for the work force 
    of the church. A work force made up of those who have to be given detailed 
    instructions for every situation, and who cannot reach judgments about complicated 
    ministry situations, will not go far. We believe the level of training often 
    found in the established church today as inadequate. We want to stick by our 
    higher standards of learning (2 Tim. 2:15). </big></li>
  <li><big><b>They must be caring</b>. The fact that our work 
    force is well-disciplined and tough should never mean they are uncaring or 
    unmerciful. God's servant is to be gentle and patient when wronged at the 
    same time he or she should be firm and immovable on the truth, including &quot;correcting 
    those who are in opposition&quot; (2 Tim. 2:24-26). A godly Servant Team would 
    be welcoming and open, helping others to reach their full potential for God. </big></li>
  <li><big><b>The work force must be leadable</b>. If Christians 
    won't respond to godly leadership, they are an uncohesive mob, not a godly 
    work force. At the very least, such a group would be completely unreliable. 
    The Bible teaches that those who want to serve God should also be prepared 
    to loyally follow the legitimate leadership in the local church (Heb. 13:17). 
    Church leadership is authorized by God to direct the operation of the church. 
    Church leaders are only authorized to lead in the operation of the church, 
    not in other areas such as telling others what to do with their houses or 
    who to marry.</big> 
    <p><big>However, when it comes to church policies and rules 
      relating to how ministry is done we will call for leadability, with or without 
      dissent. Dissent also must be within legitimate bounds. (See below.) The 
      Servant Team also has the opportunity to affirm or replace each elder every 
      three years by vote. The principle of rebellion is the principle of Satan. 
      We cannot do God's work using Satan's principle. </big></p>
  </li>
  <li><big><b>They must be cohesive</b>. Scripture is clear that 
    we are to be united in spirit and intent on one purpose (Phil. 2:2). We are 
    to be diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace (Eph. 
    4:3). This means that mature servants of the Lord have a strong desire to 
    be cohesive as part of a team. It also means mature servants elect to practice 
    interpersonal disciplines which will increase unity. Specifically: </big> 
    <ol>
      <li><big>Mature servants will not take up the offense of 
        another when they have not heard both sides. They will insist that those 
        with complaints resolve their problems maturely (Prov. 3:30; 26:17). </big></li>
      <li><big>Mature workers will avoid unrighteous judgments 
        of colleagues or others. Judging motives is one type of unrighteous judgment. 
        Scripture commands us to &quot;not go on passing judgment before the time, 
        but wait until the Lord comes who will both bring to light the things 
        hidden in the darkness and disclose the motives of men's hearts; and then 
        each man's praise will come to him from God&quot; (1 Cor. 4:5; Rom. 14:10). </big></li>
      <li><big>Cohesive workers will handle dissent in an appropriate 
        way so as to avoid ruining the unity of the church. They will go to the 
        leadership and discuss problems they are having in a timely way. They 
        will not resort to power tactics involving inciting others to rise up 
        against their opponents. They will not threaten or menace others. Such 
        tactics destroy trust and break down the ability of a group to work together 
        (Eph. 4:31; Tit. 3:2). </big></li>
      <li><big>Those who dissent from leadership directions, and 
        feel their dissent is serious, should seek understanding or compromise 
        with the leadership of the church. If they cannot obtain agreement with 
        the leadership of the church, they need to consider 1) ignoring the difference 
        and serving in harmony with the leadership's direction; 2) finding a church 
        more in agreement with their own point of view; or 3) if they plan to 
        actively oppose the direction of the church, resigning their position 
        as part of the Servant Team until they feel they can again support the 
        church's direction. Dissent should be, and is allowed in our church. However, 
        the Servant Team is for those who already agree in principle with the 
        direction of the church.</big></li>
      <li><big>We believe every Christian worker should find a 
        church where he or she can be supportive and cohesive. If no such church 
        exists, they would be better to start their own new church rather than 
        stay, fighting and unhappy (Phil. 2:2). </big></li>
      <li><big>Mature workers will also consider it mandatory 
        that they learn to forgive those who wrong them without exception. Col. 
        3:13 says we are to be &quot;bearing with one another, and forgiving each 
        other, whoever has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave 
        you, so also should you.&quot; While we can call for repentance, forgiveness 
        must be the controlling ethic of our mature team of Christian servants, 
        specifically ranking higher than avoiding hurt or wrongdoing. This is 
        because avoidance of hurt is not always possible, but forgiveness is always 
        possible. </big></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><big><b>They must be committed</b>. Commitment is more important 
    than gifting or seniority for servants of Christ. Those who have matured in 
    the Lord understand that total commitment to the things of God is our perfectly 
    reasonable service of worship. Committed Christians regularly participate 
    in personal and corporate prayer, Christian fellowship and in sacrificial 
    giving (1Tim. 2:1; Heb. 10:24, 25; Gal. 5:6,13). </big> 
    <p><big>Commitment in this context also includes commitment 
      to our particular church, and the mission and vision of our church community. 
      Our commitment to God can be lived out in any local church, but it is important 
      that mature servants of God find one church where they can give themselves 
      to God and others. In the case of those in our Servant Team, the church 
      of choice is Xenos Fellowship. </big></p>
    <p><big>Giving of ourselves should include not only time and 
      energy, but also financial support of this church's general fund, the building 
      fund (when applicable) and our missions (IICor. 8:7). This is important, 
      first because the worker believes in the cause of our church, and second 
      as a role model for others to follow. For our Servant Team, the terms for 
      qualification for the Fiscal Support Team would be the very least level 
      we could accept as a reasonable commitment. Most of us should be well above 
      these levels. Of course, there are provisions for those with special financial 
      situations to be accepted into the Fiscal Support Team even though they 
      are unable to give at a normal level. </big></p>
    <p><big>Commitment also means servants in our force are committed 
      to the direction and vision of this church as a whole, and not just to their 
      particular role in it (1Cor. 12:14; Rom. 12:10). This sometimes implies 
      the willingness to let one's own ministry decrease that the Lord might increase 
      (Jn. 3:30). Self-effacement and humility include the willingness to sacrifice 
      our ministry position for the overall good. In sports, the coach has the 
      right to put players on the bench or on the field at a given time, and to 
      make these decisions without being attacked by the players. Likewise, we 
      need to accept constraints at times, often for reasons we so not fully understand. 
      </big></p>
    <p><big>Commitment to our mission includes the idea of regular 
      attendance and prayerful concern for meetings like the Central Teachings 
      and other fellowship-wide meetings where participation lends power and edification 
      to everyone there. Serious workers should show up at such events every time 
      they are able. </big></p>
    <p><big>Commitment to this church carries the connotation 
      of loyalty. Forming earthly loyalties is not wrong, especially when we believe 
      the people to whom we are loyal are engaged in serving the Lord. Of course, 
      any such loyalty is never unconditional. Still, we can be loyal even when 
      we don't agree on every point, and in fact, especially when we don't agree 
      on every point. When we agree on every point, we don't need any loyalty 
      because nothing challenges our involvement. Only when disagreements surface 
      are we confronted with the need for loyalty. If we are unable to deliver 
      such loyalty, it suggests we have a problem with the leadership so serious 
      it could interfere with our ability to play an effective role as part of 
      the team. When we have serious reservations with the leadership or others 
      on the team, we need to be proactive in resolving those problems. </big></p>
  </li>
  <li><big><b>They should be flexible</b>. Christians who are 
    bound to traditions and external forms are ill-equipped to follow the Lord. 
    God expects mature servants to be willing to cooperate with change in ministry. 
    This acceptance of change is not a one-time event. It should be a willingness 
    to change as often and as much as needed in order to remain effective in the 
    Lord's service. While the immature will usually complain and resist change, 
    mature servants should work for change when appropriate without complaining 
    and should trust God for their security. </big></li>
  <li><big><b>They must operate on the premise of serving the 
    Lord, and doing his will</b>. This means godly servants do not operate based 
    on wrong motives such as egotism, appreciation from others, recognition, power, 
    loneliness or any other sinful motives for ministry. We will be found out 
    by the devil if we have such veins of moral weakness in our work force. </big> 
    <p><big>We are here to serve God. As such, we can't claim 
      we need to be schmoozed with every change, and have our feathers smoothed 
      at every step. These claims may apply to some extent, to the new and immature 
      believers, but cannot be claimed for leaders or other models of Christian 
      living who make up the Servant Team. A servant who needs to be schmoozed 
      over bumps in the road cannot be trusted at any but the lowest level of 
      responsibility. Such people are dependent on higher human leadership for 
      their stability. God wants those to serve him who will move forward whether 
      there is human affirmation or not. </big></p>
    <p><big>Godly servants of the Lord need the toughness that 
      only comes from denying one's self and picking up our cross to follow Christ. 
      Such servants of the Lord have to be prepared to suffer dreadfully at times, 
      and insufficient encouragement would be one of the least of these trials. 
      </big></p>
    <p><big>Servants of the Lord know what other people do or 
      don't do is not the reason for their spiritual state. Those who attribute 
      their own quitting, defection or personal sin to the actions of others are 
      revealing wrong motives for ministry. We cannot accept such a verdict. Each 
      of us has been let down by leaders and colleagues and we will be let down 
      again. But this is never an excuse for turning aside from the path the Lord 
      has for us. </big></p>
    <p><big>We cannot agree that others made us fall from the 
      Lord's way, or that we can only get up from our fallen state when these 
      others do x, y or z to repair the damage. If we have diverged from God's 
      way, we are the only ones to blame, and we must rise up to serve the Lord 
      and stop viewing our ministry horizontally and sociologically. </big></p>

<h2 class="style1"><a name="conclude"><big>Conclusion</big></a></h2> 
<p class="style1"><big>No church can be any better than its work force. We will 
  be able to accomplish important things for the Lord if we have consensus at 
  the level of our work force. I can see the following themes as likely practical 
  outworking of our vision: </big> 
<ol class="style1">
  <li><big>We could become a church strong at winning and incorporating 
    lost people just as we were before. </big></li>
  <li><big>We could complete the acquisition of our facility and 
    use it as a headquarters for our activities. </big></li>
  <li><big>We could regain our strong position in student outreach 
    and acquire a facility specifically for student outreach. A student building 
    would be good for outreach, alternative entertainment and training of students. 
    </big></li>
  <li><big>We could become a leading center for learning. With 
    our gifted and well-trained work force, we are in a position to offer expertise 
    even to those outside our own church. Our new facility would make training 
    seminars and work-study programs feasible. </big></li>
  <li><big>Xenos could become one of the great sending churches 
    for missions in America. With our large numbers and generally white-collar 
    makeup, the only thing still needed is generosity. </big></li>
  <li><big>Xenos is already becoming a national role model for 
    effective ministry to the poor. We could become outstanding leaders in this 
    area. </big></li>
  <li><big>The church in America is failing at home fellowships 
    and adult outreach. Xenos is in a position to demonstrate effective spiritual 
    approaches to these trouble spots. </big></li>
</ol>

<span class="style1"><a name="covenant">
</a></span>
<h1 class="style1"><a name="covenant">A Servant Covenant</a></h1> 
<p class="style1"><big>To this end, we have drafted a <a href="../homegroups/covenant.htm">servant 
  covenant</a>, first for leaders, and then for other mature Christian workers. 
  The standards for participants will reflect the understanding of normative mature 
  servanthood as described in this paper. </big></p>
<p class="style1"><big>We should note that Nehemiah produced a written covenant 
  for the leaders in his day, and things like giving were included in detail (Neh. 
  9:38- 11:2). This was especially appropriate at a time when the people of God 
  were facing a crisis of vision and direction. We realize that many will not 
  desire to join us in this covenant at this time. However, it is important that 
  we make this option available to those who share our conviction, so we can expressly 
  affirm our common vision for our church. </big></p>

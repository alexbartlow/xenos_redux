<h2 ALIGN="CENTER"> Effective Leaders Meetings</h2> 
<dir><b>
  </b><font SIZE="2"><p ALIGN="RIGHT">by Doug Patch</p>
</font></dir>
<font SIZE="3">

<p>&quot;Effective!&quot; Is that how you would describe your meetings? Do you even have
leaders meetings or believe they are a waste of time? It is difficult to imagine how a
leader can effectively communicate to the home group &#150; verbally and by modeling
&#150; excitement and direction for evangelism and discipleship without healthy leaders
meetings that evaluate the success and direction of the group. Here is a brief guide on
how leaders meetings can help a home group &quot;stay the course.&quot;</p>

<p>First, let&#146;s briefly consider some potential barriers to good leaders meetings:

<ol>
  <li><a href="#1.">Leaderless leaders meetings</a> &#150; these meetings need a
    &quot;chairperson&quot; &#150; usually your recognized senior leader.</li>
  <li><a href="#2.">Focus on tyranny of the urgent</a> and most recent (or chronic) crisis.</li>
  <li><a href="#3.">Immaturity on the leadership team</a> (see the Leadership Class notes on
    the web). Walking on egg-shells around issues with a group of people who are supposed to
    be the most mature of the group is antithetical to leading the group and a killer to
    leaders meetings.</li>
  <li><a href="#4">Infrequent meetings</a> &#150; then there is too much to cover when you do
    get together.</li>
  <li><a href="#5.">No collection of possible agenda items</a> ahead of time.</li>
  <li><a href="#6.">Lack of consensus of the mission</a> of the home group.</li>
  <li><a href="#7.">Lack of consensus on the present &quot;health&quot;</a> of the home group.</li>
  <li><a href="#8.">Not using the meeting to train would-be leaders</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><a name="1.">1.</a>&nbsp; <font color="#800000"><em>Leaders meetings need
someone to &quot;chair&quot; the meeting. </em></font></strong>Their role includes
collecting possible agenda items (soliciting these a few days ahead of time helps
peoples&#146; prep), deciding which items will be discussed and which won&#146;t be, and
prioritizing those to be discussed first. Soliciting from the others clearly communicates
that their views are important to the meeting but also is an excellent training tool to
encourage leaders and sit-in trainees to think about the group (Heb. 10:24). The
chairperson also helps move the meeting along to make certain it doesn&#146;t get
unnecessarily bogged down. Often they determine either that a decision can&#146;t be
reached and should be discussed again at the next meeting, or they might make a decision
if consensus was unable to be reached but a decision needed to be made. Usually, the
chairperson is the senior leader of the leadership team. </p>

<p><strong><a name="2.">2.</a>&nbsp; <font color="#800000"><em>What is the mission of the
home group? </em></font></strong>Evangelism and discipleship (hope so)? If so, it is
logical that discussions on outreach, follow-up, discipleship and leadership training
should occupy the majority of time spent in a leaders meeting. How do you do this with so
much sin, conflicts, events, etc. going on which need to be managed? As Nike used to say,
&quot;Just do it&quot;. If you try to get rid of the painful issues and event planning
first, you&#146;ll never get to what you know if most important. You must consciously do
what is most important first and then leave a little time at the end of the meeting to
deal with one or two of the more pressing matters. In our group, we typically do all of
the event planning logistics outside of this meeting. Handle the others via telephone or
email communications (this is not to say try to resolve the actual problem that way, but
the advice/decision process that must go on between the leaders).

<ol>
  <p>An excellent tool for staying focused on evangelism is the decision continuum document
  (ask your home group consultant for how to maximize this tool). </p>
  <p>The Ministry Chart format provides an excellent framework to insure follow-up and
  discipleship needs are being served. It also makes it easy to view the various options for
  planting your group as you develop your plant plans. A white-board or flip-chart works
  well in a leaders meeting to accomplish this. If you are uncertain how to utilize this
  time-honored tool, again, ask your home group consultant.</p>
</ol>

<p><strong><a name="3.">3.</a>&nbsp; <font color="#800000"><em>Spiritual maturity 
  in leaders meeting is foundational if there is to be unity of purpose. </em></font></strong>Leaders 
  meetings are exciting if leaders and trainees receive input and admonition with 
  a desire to grow and to &#145;be useful to the Master for every good work&#146; 
  (2 Tim. 2:20-21) &#150; in other words - receive correction maturely.&nbsp; 
  &quot;Spiritual maturity&quot; is a relative quality, and God will use input 
  in leaders meetings to mature us.&nbsp; Yet, there needs to be evidence of maturity 
  in this respect before inviting a trainee to sit-in the meetings.&nbsp; The 
  Christian Principles teaching on this subject helps to define what it should 
  look like to receive admonition appropriately (<a
href="../classes/principles/cpu3_encourage.htm">Unit 3 Week 3</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The paper, <a HREF="../classes/leadership/index.htm">http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/index.htm</a> 
    on &quot;What is a leader&quot; and &quot;What Makes Someone a Christian Leader?&quot; 
    helps to paint a vision for the value of this type of maturity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><a name="4">4.</a>&nbsp; <font color="#800000"><em>The frequency of the leaders
meeting</em></font></strong><font color="#800000"> <em><strong>will help determine how focused you can be on what's
most important </strong></em></font>(#2)<em><strong>. </strong></em> It depends in part on
the age range of your home group &#150; if you are primarily single or married without
children, you can probably meet more frequently than leadership teams that are primarily
with married couples and children.&nbsp; At least monthly leaders meetings will keep
issues well in hand and forward progress on evangelism, follow-up, and discipleship
maintained. Two hours is usually enough time to accomplish most of what is needed. Many
groups find it helpful to link this meeting with a night where you are going to be out
anyway &#150; EG. if cell group starts at 8:00 PM, start leaders meeting at 6 at or close
to where cell is, order pizza or subs so people don&#146;t have to stop to eat first.
Spending 15 or 20 minutes eating and fellowshipping first reconnects one another before
getting to the agenda.</p>

<p><strong><a name="5.">5.</a>&nbsp; <font color="#800000"><em>Prior collection of agenda
items is covered in #1. </em></font></strong>It is not a &quot;have to&quot; but it does
facilitate getting more accomplished in the shortest time, as well as insuring people are
thinking about and giving input into the meeting agenda.</p>

<p><strong><a name="6.">6.</a>&nbsp; <font color="#800000"><em>Leadership teams need to be
in agreement on the mission of the home group.</em></font></strong>&nbsp; If they aren't,
the group will go nowhere, conflicts will be more likely, or total disengagement will
occur because of no sense of purpose. How could Phil. 2: 2 be a reality without a clear
understanding of your group&#146;s mission? (<i>make my joy complete by being of the same
mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose</i>). Linking the
mission of your group to the mission of the church is logical and certainly biblical! </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Keeping a group conscious of and focused on its mission is essential to the home group,
  and not always easy to maintain. Communicating this to your workers regularly in quarterly
  workers meetings and cell groups is equally necessary. This can be done explicitly by
  discussing the mission, or implicitly by talking about how the group is doing in those
  arenas (reporting numerical growth over the past year, spiritual commitments made by
  individuals, etc.). In a discussion format, have the workers talk about the link between
  your structures (CT, home group, cell, parties, C&amp;C, playgroups, etc.) and the
  mission. This revives their sense of purpose and helps maintain their outward focus. It
  also minimizes legalistic involvement in these structures when they remind themselves how
  God is using them to do His work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><a name="7.">7.</a>&nbsp; <font color="#800000"><em>Leaders meetings are
agonizing if there isn&#146;t consensus on the overall health of the group.</em></font></strong>
Stated another way, instrumental to effective meetings is regularly committing time to
evaluating the health of the group. There is no simple way to describe how to do this;
working with your home group consultant will help, but the leadership team&#146;s
discernment on this must be developed. Tools that have proven helpful (although this is
far from exclusive) include:

<ul>
  <li>Overall Group evaluation</li>
</ul>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>See the paper <a HREF="../classes/leadership/Hceval.htm">http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/Hceval.htm</a> 
      for an excellent tool.</p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ul>
  <li>Evangelism health</li>
</ul>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>Home Group chart from the Xenos database &#150; particularly the &quot;Home Group
    Comprehensive Attendance Individual by Month&quot; &#150; your consultant can provide
    this. Obviously, you want to see that first-timers are regularly coming to meetings.</p>
    <p>Decision Continuum chart where all workers include people they are reaching out to
    &#150; good for use in cell groups and/or personal discipleship.</p>
    <p>People talking about time spent with non-Christians, spiritual conversations, etc.</p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ul>
  <li>Follow-up health</li>
</ul>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>The comprehensive chart mentioned in Evangelism health tracks &quot;returning new&quot;
    statistics and calculates your follow-up ratios. The &quot;returning new&quot; charts
    should be steadily going up. This is the only area a home group can grow. A first-timer is
    that only once, and you can&#146;t get more old members during the cycle of your group.
    Therefore good follow-up of first timers is absolutely necessary for home group growth.</p>
    <p>Nothing replaces talking about the new people, Christians and non, that 
      have been to the group lately and who is investing in them (usually the 
      person who brought them). These papers are instrumental to understanding 
      and leading home group follow-up: <a
    HREF="../classes/leadership/hcfoll.htm">http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/hcfoll.htm</a> 
      <a HREF="../classes/leadership/fulead.htm">http://www.xenos.org/classes/leadership/fulead.htm</a> 
    </p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ul>
  <li>Discipleship</li>
</ul>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>The Ministry Chart is a tool proven effective for seeing that people are being invested
    in, and its development and revisions should lead to discussions about the sanctification
    and ministry of your workers.</p>
    <p>Leadership development is necessary to plant a group and should be a regular topic of
    discussion in leaders meetings.</p>
  </dir>
  <p>When your leadership team basically agrees on the health of the group it often leads to
  unified discussion on direction for the group.</p>
</dir>

<p><strong><a name="8.">8.</a>&nbsp; <font color="#800000"><em>Your leaders meetings
should train one another and sit-in trainees HOW to lead.</em></font></strong> Don&#146;t
just make decisions without talking about how to make them, what factors should be
considered (ask for these, don&#146;t just lecture), how the issue fits into the
priorities of the group, what biblical principles are at play with the discussion, etc. In
other words, you should be helping one another develop wisdom so that all are better able
to make solid decisions in the future even when you aren&#146;t there, when the next
leadership team has been planted with their group. Does this reduce how much you
accomplish in this meeting? Yes, absolutely. You can accomplish much more by flopping the
issue on the table, argue briefly about each others&#146; opinion, and then the Senior
Leader just decide. The shortfalls of this are obvious, and there are times as mentioned
above, that the Sr. Leader needs to make a decision in the absence of consensus so that
the issue can be resolved. However, multiplication of groups requires multiplication of
leaders who understand the biblical and relational principles that are foundational to
directing a home group.</p>

<p>Hopefully, these elements will contribute to solid leaders meetings in your home group
ministry. Your home group consultant is an excellent source of guidance for developing
healthy leaders meeting dynamics. <b>Take and re-take the Leadership Class!!</b> God will
grow your understanding of leadership through experience and sanctification. The topics
and issues discussed in this class will have greater application for you as your
experience in leadership develops. </p>

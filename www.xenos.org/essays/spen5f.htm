<h3><big>The Effect of Mysticism on Ecclesiology</big></h3>

<p><big>Although the moderate form of mysticism that Spener infused into the mainstream of
Lutheran theology was not revolutionary, it contained premises which lead to revolution.
The effect of mystical theology generally is to foster a more &quot;spiritual&quot; or
subjective understanding of the nature of Christian soteriology, especially
sanctification. These were the main applications that Spener drew from his fusion of
mysticism and biblically oriented Lutheranism. However, it would be naive to think that
these same premises would not also, in time, lead to a more &quot;spiritual&quot; or
subjective understanding of the church. </big></p>

<p><big>Brown points out that from the earliest time, the terms &quot;pietistic&quot; and
&quot;individualistic&quot; have been used synonymously in theological parlance.167
Likewise, the mystic is alone with his God when most of the deep things happen. The
mystical gospel calls for individual growth or attainment, and does not excuse the
individual for carnality, even if he/she does go to church. Mystical theology tends to ask
not &quot;How is your community doing?&quot; but &quot;How is your personal walk with God
doing?&quot; This is why Alfred Hegler is plausible when he argued that &quot;the basic
source for . . .the `radical reform movements,' the `radical tributaries,' or the `left
wing' of the Reformation was medieval mysticism.&quot;168 </big></p>

<p><big>Heyd observes, </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>True, individual judgment had always been a constituent element of the Protestant
  tradition, but it is often forgotten that in the period of the Reformation and of
  Protestant Orthodoxy, the role ascribed to the individual was counterbalanced by the
  central position of the Church and public authorities in determining issues of doctrine
  and discipline. 169 </big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big>This individualistic outlook would have been given added impulse by Spener's
insistence that the individual study his Bible, and develop ministry.170 Once again,
history teaches that the individual with the Bible in his hand is a force for spiritual
revolution. It is not without cause that the established church has sometimes tended to
avoid too many laymen with too many Bibles--such individuals might reach new conclusions:
perhaps heretical conclusions, perhaps critiques of the existing church. Stoeffler feels
that the biblicism of the Pietists, which was not a factor in mystical theology, accounts
for the change in view regarding roles in the church. </big></p>

<p><big>It was this implicit, somewhat naive, trust in the Word, rather than in man's
words about the Word, which is also responsible for the fact that Pietists really trusted
the religious opinions of theologically untrained laymen. The theory was, of course, that
the Spirit of God is able to commend the truth of the Bible to men's minds and hearts
without the tortured interpretations of the professionals. Hence, to the consternation of
the representatives of orthodoxy and ecclesiastical institutionalism, laymen were
permitted to testify, to exhort, and even to preach. The doctrine of the priesthood of all
believers was thus rescued once again from being a mere dogma and set free to exert its
influence in the Church. 171 </big></p>

<p><big>As some Pietists went into separatism, Spener tried to stem the tide that he had
unleashed, with limited success. Brown explains; </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>[Spener] attempted to persuade all to return to the church. This was the purpose
  of his tract, The Use and the Misuse of the Laments Over Corrupted Christendom, which
  appeared in 1684 and was reprinted in 1687 and 1696. In this tract Spener stated that even
  though the church was corrupt, it was the true church from which no one should turn away..
  . . </big></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>He repeatedly deplored separation, &quot;claiming that it acted like a medicine
  which was more dangerous than the disease it was supposed to cure.. . . </big></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>Nevertheless, the extreme expression of self-assertion against external church
  authority which more and more emancipated itself from the restraints of tradition was the
  work of later Pietism.172 </big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big>Spener's and Francke's individualism also tended to move them toward more
democratic control in the churches. Brown says, </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>Spener and Francke were consistently Lutheran; nevertheless, they and their
  followers often stretched Luther's definitions in their appeal for a more democratic
  church polity and in the mystical tendencies inherent in the style of the conventicles. .
  . </big></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>Spener was criticized for the egalitarianism of his pastoral service and his small
  group meetings, in which servants were allowed to sit and the same tables as their
  masters.173 </big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big>Naturally, the view of the individual before his God tended to render class and
ecclesiastic distinctions meaningless.174 </big></p>

<p><big>Another ecclesiological by-product of the fusion of Reformation and Mystical
theology was the alteration of Lutheran sacramentalism. The platonism of the medieval
mystics sometimes led to an anti-sacramental attitude. An example this can be seen in the
Theologia Deutsch, which, after quoting Tauler as declaring, &quot;There be some men at
the present time who take leave of imagery [sacraments] too soon. . .&quot; goes on to
argue that only, </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>. . .as a man has thus broken loose from and overleaped all temporal things and
  creatures he may afterward come to perfection in a life of contemplation. For he who will
  have the one must let the other go. There is no other way.175 </big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big>The argument here is not that one should avoid leaving sacraments behind, but
rather that this should not be attempted by the immature. Likewise, Arndt did not usually
speak of baptismal regeneration, as did his orthodox contemporaries. </big></p>

<p><big>He thus linked himself definitely with many of the later Lutheran Pietists to whom
the Lutheran doctrine of baptismal regeneration as popularly held was always an occasion
of regret or at least of embarrassment. . .[although] Arndt held the historic Lutheran
view of baptism. In point of fact, however, he said little about it and put the emphasis
on conversion, oneness with Christ, and a holy life.&quot; 176 </big></p>

<p><big>It is not surprising then that Spener's and Francke's critics, </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>. . .accused them of adopting a mystical and spiritualistic interpretation of the
  sacraments. Spener, as customary, desired to walk the middle ground: &quot;as in all
  things, two extremes are possible, it is a deviation to place your trust outwardly in the
  mere custom of the sacrament and be concerned little with the inward. But it is also a
  deviation when one chooses to despise and set aside the outward because of the
  inward.&quot;177 </big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big>The tension between adult conversion and infant baptism became acute for Spener
and Francke. This should be especially clear when one realizes that they did not accept
the doctrine of unconditional election.178 </big></p>

<p><big>Likewise, Spener's stress on the possibility of losing the new birth following
baptism and on the new obedience which baptism requires significantly altered traditional
baptism. </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>The Pietists' need for subjective appropriation made it possible for some of the
  followers of Spener and Francke to minimize infant baptism in favor of the later
  conversion experience and to circumvent the objective efficacy of the sacrament. Francke
  and Spener, however, attempted to avoid this tendency.179 </big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big>The churchly pietists were careful to not openly question the orthodox
interpretation of the sacraments. </big></p>

<p><big>However, Brown credits Spener with a major role in undermining the Beischtuhl
(confessional) permanently in Lutheranism. This in spite of the fact that Francke himself
confessed to a neighboring minister four times each year before partaking of the Lord's
supper. </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>The Beischtuhl . . .figured prominently in Pietist controversies. Although it was
  practically considered a sacrament by many of the orthodox, Spener and Francke felt freer
  to attack it than the two traditional Protestant sacraments. . . .its is very likely that
  Pietism, with its critical stance and opposition to compulsion, abetted the demise of the
  confessional.180 </big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big>As we shall see, many of the later radical Pietists openly rejected or deprecated
sacraments.</big></p>

<h3><big>The Churchly Pietistic Movement</big></h3>

<h5><big>Pietistic Conventicles</big></h5>

<p><big>Spener held the first of his private meetings in his own home in Frankfurt am Main
in 1670. With the popularity of the Pia Desideria, there were soon conventicles meeting
all over Europe. Tappert affirms that, </big></p>

<p><big>Spener himself soon ascribed more and more importance to the collegia pietatis,
which were given only passing attention in his Pia Desideria. If the church was to be
renewed, he felt, a beginning would have to be made with the remnant of true Christians in
every congregation.181 </big></p>

<p><big>The responses to the advent of the collegia pietatis were two-fold--bitter attacks
from the church,182 and terrific excitement from lay people. Two questions that must be
answered are, &quot;Why did such an enthusiastic reception greet the collegia?&quot; and,
&quot;Why were they opposed so bitterly by the church?&quot; </big></p>

<p><big>Regarding the first question, before a proper understanding of pietism can be
gained, one must realize that there was a vigorous ferment of pietistic, spiritualistic
and mystical strains already present in Europe at this time, independent of Spener's
movement. This can be seen, for instance, when one considers how many tens of thousands of
Anabaptists were killed from the time of the Reformation until the time of Spener.183 For
Anabaptism to have still been a vital force in Europe despite this many casualties gives
an idea of the profound thirst for religious authenticity and freedom that must have given
rise to such endurance. </big></p>

<p><big>Many authors have insisted that the Thirty Years War, with its hundreds of
thousands of deaths on all sides, had rendered institutional religion disgusting in the
view of much of the public. Then there were the many thousands of cells or nuclei of
various other groups who took a more inner view of Christianity.184 This spiritualistic
underground was the well-spring that was uncapped by Spener. </big></p>

<p><big>When the Pia Desideria, with its concise and persuasive arrangement, not to
mention its friendly and benign tone, was published by one with the prestige of the
scholarly Spener, thousands rallied to it as a standard. It is very unlikely that all of
these were persuaded for the first time by the book. They were probably already inclined
to a more personal form of religious expression.185 </big></p>

<p><big>Speaking of such an underground that had been a part of the European scene for
several hundred years, Peters shows that the themes had always been the same; </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>In particular terms, the Reformists attacked the immorality of the clergy, the
  hierarchy, and the authority of the church; usually they also attacked the sacraments as
  unnecessary to salvation and as supposing the necessity of a mediating clergy between a
  man and his God.186 </big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big>Regarding the second question, the attacks by the existing clergy were severe.
&quot;The charge of the theological faculty of the University of Wittemberg that pietists
were guilty of at least 284 heresies suggests something of its bitterness. . .Spener was
called a Quaker, a Rosicrucian, a chiliast, and a fanatic.&quot;187 The main reason the
church attacked the collegia so vigorously seems to have been worry about their ability to
control the situation. Brown observes, </big></p>

<p><big>Engendering the most criticism and accusations of subjectivism were the small
group meetings known variously as Collegia pietatis, conventicles, ecclesiolae, or
collegia philobiblica.188 </big></p>

<p><big>Very soon after the first one was started in Spener's home, it became the occasion
for separatist activity.189 As mentioned earlier, Spener tried to tie the meetings to the
church by forbidding the Lord's Supper in the private gatherings. In spite of this and
other safeguards, however, the conventicles continued to foster movements toward
separation. Deeter comments, </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>The major problem of the colleges of piety was that they stimulated certain
  participants to a radical Christianity which could not be generally spread throughout the
  larger body of the Church. Then after repeated frustrations at the slowness of many fellow
  church goers to accept more radical Christian living, the unsatisfied converts often
  became separatistic. . . Moreover, they were often openly antagonistic to the compromisers
  within the larger Church who saw something of their vision but refused to break with its
  `half-way Christianity.'&quot;190 </big></p>
</blockquote>

<h5><big>Francke </big></h5>

<p><big>August Hermann Francke was born in 1663, and studied theology at Liepzig. He
started home Bible studies while there called collegium philobiblicum. Yet he suffered
from doubt regarding inspiration of Scripture and even the existence of God. He was
influenced by followers of Spener while in Liepzig.191 Then in 1687 he experienced a
decisive conversion which left him sure of his relationship with Christ.192 He visited
Spener for several months afterward and returned to operate his home studies in the
Pietistic fashion. An investigation, initiated by a suspicious clergyman, led to the
suppression of the home studies.193 After being ousted from a pastorate in Erfurt because
of Pietistic activities, Spener was able to get him a professorship of Greek and oriental
languages at the newly-founded university at Halle, along with a pastorate in a local
church.194 </big></p>

<p><big>Francke was different than Spener. He was much more decisive and active. He shared
in common with Spener however, a practical bent, and the desire to avoid open separation
from the Lutheran church.195 Francke exerted great influence at Halle, eventually
unleashing a new phase in the history of Pietism. </big></p>

<p><big>Under the influence of Francke, Pietistic spirituality was increasingly
interpreted in an outward, in addition to an inward way. This had the effect of providing
an outlet for Pietistic zeal other than perfectionism, and may have had more impact on the
course of church history than any other part of the Pietistic movement. </big></p>

<p><big>He founded numerous social relief institutions a Halle, including a school for
poor children, a very large orphanage, an institute for training of teachers, and later a
publishing house, medical clinic, and others businesses where the indigent could work and
pay their way. </big></p>

<p><big>In addition, Francke had a &quot;lifelong concern for evangelism and
missions.&quot;196 He eventually turned Halle into a training center for missionaries who
went all over the world. This was important because neither the Lutheran nor the Reformed
churches had the slightest interest in missions at that time. Glover explains, </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>The roots of modern missions reach back to the Reformation . . .Yet, as already
  remarked, the Reform leaders, and the Reformation church as a whole, were for at least a
  full century almost completely devoid of missionary spirit or effort. . .As Dr. George
  Smith expresses it, the seeds of controversy sown by Lutheran orthodoxy began to bear a
  harvest which would have been fatal to the spirituality of the Church but for the Pietist
  Movement, which by example and preaching gradually aroused the Church to a deeper
  spiritual life and, as a natural consequence, to renewed missionary zeal and action.197 </big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big>Francke was not the first to see the evangelistic implications of the Pietistic
message. Spener had stated in the Spiritual Priesthood, </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>Is there anything else that we should offer to God? </big></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>Yes; namely the doctrine of the gospel and thereby our fellow man who by it is
  converted and sanctified (Malachi 1:11; Rom. 15:16; Is. 60:7; Phil. 2:17,18. . .). 198 </big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big>However, this was problematic when the entire society was already considered
Christian. The only groups who were considered &quot;unsaved&quot; were the Jews and the
Roman Catholics. These were the groups that Spener had suggested should be won.199 </big></p>

<p><big>By moving in the direction of foreign missions, Francke was the first to put
effective action to the concept of outreach as a fruit of spiritual growth. </big></p>

<p><big>A careful study of the biography of Francke is outside the scope of this paper,
but the main points along with source material can be read in Pietists: Selected Writings,
Peter C. Erb Ed. </big></p>

<h5><big>Zinzindorf</big></h5>

<p><big>Zinzindorf was Francke's student at Halle, and Spener's godson. He underwent an
awakening while studying, and proceeded to organize a group of refugees from Moravia into
collegia pietatis within the Lutheran church. Later, they formed the basis of the
re-vitalized Moravian Brethren church.200 This group exerted global influence, and are
perhaps the main river flowing out of the churchly Pietistic movement. </big></p>

<p><big>Properly speaking, William Carey should not be called the father of the modern
missionary movement. Sixty years before Carey went out, and 150 years before Hudson Taylor
went out, the Moravian Brethren began sending out their first missionaries. Their first
outreach was to St. Thomas Island in the West Indies in 1732.201 They reached out to
twelve more areas of the world within the next twenty years, and eventually sent out 2,158
missionaries within the next 150 years! The well known English social reformer, William
Wilberforce wrote of the Moravians, &quot;They are a body who have perhaps excelled all
mankind in solid and unequivocal proofs of the love of Christ and ardent, active zeal in
His service.&quot;202 </big></p>

<h5><big>Wesley</big></h5>

<p><big>Most reading evangelical Christians are aware that Wesley was impressed by the
Moravian Brethren missionaries he met while he was still an unconverted priest on his way
to Georgia. Later, Wesley attended a Moravian meeting at Aldersgate St. where, while
hearing Luther's introduction to Romans, he had an experience in which he said &quot;I
felt my heart strangely warmed. . ..&quot; </big></p>

<p><big>However, many do not realize that within two weeks of this experience, Wesley
decided to go to Germany and spend time studying under the Pietists at Halle. He recounts
the reasons for the decision, </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>&quot;I hoped that conversing with those holy men who were themselves living
  witnesses of the full power of faith, and yet able to bear with those that are weak, would
  be a means, under God, of so establishing my soul, that I might go on from faith to faith.
  . .&quot; 203 </big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big>Wesley then spent the next four months with the Pietists at Halle. Subsequently,
we find many elements of the Pietistic agenda present in Wesley's ministry. </big></p>

<p><big>He began to include a distinct call for conversion in his sermons. He organized
conventicles, which were called &quot;classes,&quot; &quot;societies,&quot; or
&quot;bands,&quot; depending on their size makeup, and purpose. Attendance at a band
required that the member bring his or her penny for the poor (recalling the practical
relief concerns of the Halle group). His theological outlook reflects that of Francke and
Spener very much. Finally, he sought to do all of this within the bounds of his own
confession (Anglican). </big></p>

<p><big>For these reasons, the Methodist movement is considered by historians and
theologians to be in the mainstream of the churchly Pietistic movement. </big></p>

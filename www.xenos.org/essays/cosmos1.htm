<h1>PHILOSOPHICAL INFLUENCES ON COSMOLOGY</h1>

<h5>Larry House</h5>

<hr>

<h3>ABSTRACT </h3>

<p>This paper presents the conflicts between Christianity and Science pertaining to
differing cosmologies. Our ultimate concern is whether the sources of conflict between
biblical and scientific cosmologies are due to contradictory data or erroneous
interpretations of the data. Our contention is that the points of opposition between
biblical and scientific cosmologies have arisen primarily due to opposing philosophical
views applied to the interpretation of events and statements related to the origin and
formation of the universe. Thus our principal objective is to identify the philosophical
presuppositions and their influences on the interpretation of cosmological data.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>In the last three centuries many conflicts have arisen between science and Christianity
on various topics. Two major controversial topics of contemporary concern are the origin
and formation of life and the universe. The theories of evolution and cosmology share a
number of controversies in common. Although it would be instructive to discuss how these
controversies are related the subject of this discussion will be limited to the
philosophical issues surrounding modern cosmology. </p>

<p>In addressing the conflicts between scientific and biblical cosmologies, it is
important for the sake of clarity to distinguish between the domains of Science and
Theology. It can be said in very broad terms that Science is a methodology for
interpreting physical data and concerns itself with the description of events. Theology,
on the other hand, is a methodology for interpreting biblical text (scriptures as
linguistic data) and primarily concerns itself with the significance of events. Science
and theology in these broad contexts are somewhat mutually exclusive in that they address
topics to which the others methodologies do not apply. Nevertheless, there are biblical
statements about the physical world and thus there are overlapping scientific and
religious views regarding the nature of the physical world. Conflict arises when the
theological and scientific interpretations concerning those events held in common are in
disagreement.<a href="#Footnote1B" name="Footnote1A">Footnote1</a> The nature of the
disagreement is sometimes problematic because both theologian and scientist have on
occasion commented on issues outside their competence. Furthermore both disciplines,
science and theology, have employed their distinctive methodologies to attack problems to
which their methods do not apply. This has all contributed to various points of opposition
between science and Christianity. </p>

<p>The controversies between biblical and scientific cosmologies will be discussed in the
context of the following central questions: 

<ul>
  <li>What is the nature of the conflict? </li>
  <li>Are the biblical and scientific views contradictory? </li>
  <li>Is there a resolution satisfactory to both theology and science? <p>We will attempt to
    show that the points of opposition are philosophical in origin and not necessarily a
    contradiction between scientific data and scriptures. </p>
    <p>This can be a difficult task because philosophical views are often so deeply embedded
    in our basic understanding of the world that we can be unaware of their presence without
    considerable reflection. According to Donald MacKay &quot;it is never too easy to
    distinguish hard scientific data from the philosophical extrapolations from them which are
    put about in the name of Science.&quot; Similarly it is often difficult to distinguish the
    true meaning of biblical scriptures from the philosophical extrapolations that are put
    about in the name of Christianity. A classic illustration of the conflict between theology
    and scientific cosmology is given by the following example:</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>In 1615 a conflict arose between Galileo Galilei and the Roman Catholic Church. A
    priest named Niccolo Lorini sent a letter to the Inquisitors-General in Rome expressing
    his concern that the followers of Galileo &quot;were taking upon themselves to expound the
    Holy Scriptures according to their private lights,...<i>that they were trampling underfoot
    all of Aristotle's philosophy</i>....I believe that the Galilieans are orderly men and all
    good Christians, but a little wise and cocky in their opinions.&quot; </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>Although the conflict focussed on interpretation of scripture it was the underlying
    philosophical foundation of the interpretations that produced the conflict. In this case
    the official Church doctrine was aligned with the philosophy of Aristotle. It was the
    conclusions drawn from Aristotle's view of cosmology that Galileo challenged and not the
    biblical view. </p>
    <p>This then is the principal thesis to be developed here: the conflicts between theology
    and science on the subject of cosmology are generally rooted in either opposing
    philosophical views or philosophical confusions between the data and their interpretation.
    It is proposed that theology and science are both tainted with their own unstated
    philosophical presuppositions (either unwittingly or deceptively by the theologian and
    scientist) thus affecting their various interpretations of cosmology. If the Christian
    view point holds science to represent truth revealed by God through nature and scripture
    to represent truth provided through God's special revelation, then the two
    &quot;truths&quot; cannot be contradictory. This does not necessitate a natural theology,
    nor preclude it, but it does require nature and revelation to make compatible statements. </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEOLOGY AND SCIENCE</h3>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>There is generally held to be a dichotomous relationship between science and religion.
    As discussed in the introduction the description of physical events falls under the
    purview of science while explanation of the significance of events is often considered to
    be the domain of religion. In this sense the activities of these two fields have at times
    been considered to be mutually exclusive. While science and religion may claim some
    exclusivity they also by nature of their activity and claims have a domain where they must
    interact. Thus if one is to make a broad statement about the relationship between science
    and religion, and particularly on the specific subject of cosmology, it would be more
    accurate to describe them as complementary. If we ascribe rational qualities to both
    science and religion then it is impossible to maintain that they are mutually exclusive
    with respect to their statements about the nature of events. The complementary nature of
    theology and science does not mean that the two cannot make contradictory statements
    provided one or both are in error. Nor does this mean that one can always have it both
    ways by invoking complementarity to declare opposing statements only have the
    &quot;appearance&quot; of contradiction. Thus the question remains; what is the
    relationship between scientific cosmology and biblical cosmology? </p>
    <p>To properly address conflicts between biblical and scientific cosmologies one must
    establish if a proper relationship between theology and science exists and, if so, the
    relationship must be defined. There are four sharply contrasting views regarding this
    relationship:</p>
    <p><br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>concordist</b> - scientific and theological views are interpretative methodologies
        that carry equal weight and their conclusions must be reconciled, </li>
      <li><b>purely religious</b> - this view asserts science and theology are unrelated and thus
        there are no interactions between the two views, </li>
      <li><b>complementarity</b> - there is a scientific language necessary to describe events in
        the physical world and a religious language necessary to describe events associated with
        higher levels of consciousness, </li>
      <li><b>dogmatism</b> - scientific views hold greater authority and refute the theological
        views where there is a contradiction (scientific dogmatism, usually an atheistic
        contention) or scientific views must be made to submit to and support the theological
        views (religious dogmatism). <p><br>
        </p>
        <p>The concordist view requires biblical and scientific interpretations to harmonize. This
        view admits possible contradictions and attempts to resolve them. The purely religious
        view claims science and religion are mutually exclusive domains of study and cannot
        legitimately interact. Any contradictions arising between theology and science are
        pseudo-problems arising from one discipline trespassing on the other's proper domain.
        Complementarity asserts that theology and science are addressing different levels of one
        underlying reality. Complementary descriptions of reality on occasion gives rise to the
        appearance of theological and scientific contradictions. However these
        pseudo-contradictions occur because of confusions that arise when the predicates used by
        the two distinct languages (theological versus scientific) to describe each level of
        existence are mixed. Dogmatism is an appeal to the authority of one interpretative scheme
        over the other. Scientific atheists and religious fundamentalists tend to hold this view.
        The relationship between science and theology adopted in the following discussion is one
        of moderate concordism and complementarity. We avoid dogmatism because there is
        substantial evidential basis for the validity of both scientific and theological
        methodologies. The purely religious view is avoided because it tends to produce a
        dualistic view that implies the physical aspects of life are irrelevant to spiritual
        concerns and vice versa. This leads to noninteracting spiritual and physical worlds which
        is contrary to the biblical theme concerning the relationship between God and man.</p>
        <p><a href="#Footnote1A" name="Footnote1B">Footnote1</a></p>
        <p>1. For example Genesis 1:1 states that the universe was created and had a beginning.
        Romans 4:17 says God calls things into being that did not exist. Until this century
        science generally accepted the universe as being eternal, thus denying that the universe
        had a beginning and held that nothing could be made out of nothing. </p>

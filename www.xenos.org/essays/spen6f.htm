<h3><big>The Radical Pietistic Revolt</big></h3>

<p><big>As mentioned earlier, just as the effect of mystical theology is to impart a more
&quot;spiritualized&quot; view of the nature of sanctification, in time, it would also
tend to lead to a more &quot;spiritual&quot; or subjective understanding of the church. </big></p>

<p><big>Indeed, as already seen, even Spener was well on the way to a re-introduction of
the primitive church forms that would unavoidably undercut the foundations of
institutional Lutheranism. His dual calls for the individual believers to divide the
Scriptures, while not infringing on the prerogatives of the clergy were probably
self-contradictory in practice. At least the clergy would make these calls mutually
exclusive. Tappert says, </big></p>

<p><big>It is hardly surprising that the initial enthusiasm for the <i>Pia Desideria </i>cooled
somewhat when the implications of one or another of these planks in Spener's platform
became clearer. Clergymen felt threatened in their status by the rise of the laity,
professors of theology resented the brash incursion of outsiders into their academic
preserve, and the complacent were disturbed by appeals or change and for departure from
what was familiar, customary, and comfortable.204 </big></p>

<p><big>In spite of his determination to abide within the confines of his own confession,
Spener tended to resist the structural strongholds of the status quo. When his critics
pushed the idea that the collegiate clergy alone had the authority to interpret
sufficiently in the symbols, Spener observed that, &quot;. . .one pope would be better
than many popes.&quot;205 </big></p>

<p><big>Viewed this way, separatism, and the Radical Pietistic revolt were the logical
outgrowth of Spener's theology--not confused distortions of it. Spener's own cries against
separatism and anti-clericalism have a hollow ring when heard in the light of his call for
a return to more radically biblical principles. </big></p>

<p><big>Spener, unlike many of his contemporaries, said the Symbolical Books206 are of
human origin, and while God has provided so that they would not contain errors in basic
doctrines which are necessary for salvation, He did permit errors in secondary matters to
remind us of the distinction between the Symbolical Books and the Holy Scriptures. 207 </big></p>

<p><big>These chippings at the foundations of the established orthodoxy proved to be a
door which, once opened even a little, could not be closed again. The followers who took
the Pietistic teachings to an extreme, both in soteriology and in ecclesiology tended to
become very perfectionistic and hard to please. Some of them felt that separation from the
world was the only to reach the ideal of inward perfection implied in some of the mystical
thought used by Pietists. When separating one's self from the wicked world, what could be
more wicked than the control hungry established denominations? Surely one must separate
himself from man's church as well as from man's society. </big></p>

<h3><big>Arnold</big></h3>

<p><big>An example par excellence of the kind of hyper-idealistic individualism that grew
out of this &quot;inward&quot; view of Christianity can be seen in the ecclesiology of
Gottfried Arnold. </big></p>

<p><big>Arnold had experienced a religious awakening while studying law at Wittemberg,
apparently as a result of Spener's ministry.208 He was discipled by Spener for about two
years while a tutor at Dresden. Later, Spener got him a posting to teach at Quedlinburg,
which happened to be a hot-bed of separatism at that time.209 There he produced his first
major work on early church history--Wahre Abbildung. As a result of this book, he was
given the professorship of church history at Giessen in 1697. There he had extensive
contact with Gichtel and Hochman (see below). Gichtel was a Boehmist, although this is not
as clear in the case of Hochman. </big></p>

<p><big>Arnold's study of church history and the early church led him to feel that there
was no church or sect in which a truly God-seeking person could retain his devotion to
Christ without severe hindrances. Eventually, &quot;Arnold comes to doubt that the
requisite inwardness of the true church can ever be exhibited by a community
again.&quot;210 </big></p>

<p><big>Not surprisingly, he eventually came to depreciate the value of all forms of
outwardness including the sacraments. He sees the Kingdom of God as preeminently
inward.211 Arnold's super-spiritual critical view eventually leads him to render a
negative verdict on every expression of the church that he considered in his other major
work on church history, the Ketzerhistorie. 212 </big></p>

<p><big>Stoffer says, &quot;Arnold's trademark is clearly discernible: the necessity of
looking to the early church as the norm for Christian life.&quot;213 The subjugation of
ecclesiology to the doctrines of personal piety is denied by Stoffer. However, he admits
that </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>. . .the renewal of the individual and the work of the Holy Spirit. . . are given
  added force in the Ketzerhistorie. . . .for the life of the regenerate man becomes the
  standard for judging all aspects of church history.214 </big></p>
</blockquote>

<h3><big>Hochman</big></h3>

<p><big>Another renown Pietistic dissenter was Ernst Christoph Hochman. His <i>Glaubensbekenntnis</i>
(published in 1743) is considered, &quot;a reliable credenda of the Schwarzenau
movement,&quot; which included the early German Baptist Brethren. 215 Hochaman tends to
agree with many of Arnold's views in <i>Ketzerhistorie</i>. </big></p>

<p><big>Hochman was a traveling evangelist, more or less in the tradition of the mendicant
(beggar) preachers of earlier times. He eventually settles for some time in the province
of Wittgenstein. This province, under the rule of a Count Henry, needed more citizens for
tax purpose. It therefore began welcoming religious dissenters and separatists of every
stripe from as far away as Switzerland. These included Mennonites, Labadists, Lutheran
Pietists, and Quakers. 216 </big></p>

<p><big>That Hochman's influence on the German Brethren movement was a lasting one, is
demonstrated by the fact that his Glaubensbekenntnis was brought to America by the
Brethren, and was published by the Germantown press of Christopher Sauer in 1743.217 </big></p>

<p><big>It is interesting to note that Hochman, like Spener may have been influenced by
Labadie. We know he visited Labadist cells in Krefeld Holland, which also became the later
home of some of the German Baptist Brethren. 218 Krefeld was at that time (between 1683
and 1720) a key rallying point for Separatists. Even before Hochman preached there, the
inclination for `separation' had been planted. 219 </big></p>

<p><big>The European Origins of the Brethren, by Donald F. Durnmaugh is the most complete
collection of early German Baptist Brethren and radical pietistic documents available in
translation. It contains many fascinating authentic letters and records of interrogations,
etc. which portray the reactions and outlooks of the people involved in the clearest, and
most reliable way. </big></p>

<p><big>A feel for the poignance of a life of free-form revolutionary agitation can be
gained by reading an exchange of letters between a Palatine official at Mannheim and the
Elector Palatine regarding the town's response to an incident where several adults had
been baptized by Hochman and Mack. </big></p>

<p><big>When the official at Mannheim reported that several citizens had been baptized as
adults, and asked for guidance, the Elector published an edict that read in part, </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>[those]...who profess this error and hold secret conventicles in homes or
  elsewhere, [shall be] carefully watched, especially the leaders. Those who commit this
  evil and who do not respond either to kingly or severe warnings to abandon these wicked
  intentions and maintain this especially stubbornly are to be arrested at once without
  special authorization. They are to be put in prison, and as many of them as there are must
  be locked to wheelbarrows and kept on public work on the fortifications or at other common
  labor. They are to be separated from one another in various places, and put on a
  bread-and-water diet. September 14, 1706. </big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big>In response to this the local official arrested a few Taufgesinnten [baptism
factionaries] and reported the result, </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>On the basis of this, they were sentenced to public labor on the Neckar River in
  the hope that others of their ilk would be intimidated. However, it is impossible to
  describe what a great sympathy all of the Reformed subjects have shown for them. They have
  defended the Pietists' teachings, and said that nothing could be found deserving
  punishment in such pious Christians as far as they could see or hear. They have
  unashamedly proclaimed and made this their own cause. In addition, they immediately began
  going in processions to the prisoners outside of the city, not out of curiosity, but to
  spend all day listening to them. The prisoners preached continually instead of doing the
  assigned labor. They have also sent them plenty to eat and drink despite the published
  prohibition. </big></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>The civil guard appointed to watch them was powerless to prevent this, and was no
  longer sure of his own safety because of the open threats against him. I was finally
  forced to request a military guard and ordered him to go there. The latter gave the
  leader, the so-called Hochmann, a few harmless blows, because the latter would neither
  stop his continual preaching nor accommodate himself to working. </big></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>This caused such compassion, tumult, and exaggeration from the Reformed party as
  if these &quot;innocent&quot; people were being treated barbarously, so that an open
  rebellion was to be feared. This was even though I had released the two local citizens
  among the prisoners upon their declaration that they would again profess the Reformed
  faith. The Reformed party demonstrated such an unusual hatred for me because of this that
  one can obviously see that most of the Reformed have fallen prey to this Pietistic error
  and conspire with them.&quot; </big></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>&quot;It is my humble opinion that a still harsher edict should be drawn up
  against this Pietistic sect and their defenders.&quot; </big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big>Instead, the elector answered, </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>. . .As the prisoners have obediently appealed again for merciful amelioration by
  the enclosed submissive petition, we have thereupon graciously resolved to dismiss the
  same at this time. They are to be expelled with the stern warning that they must never set
  foot in Mannheim or any other place in the territory. . .220 </big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big>Life in a society where no churches were permitted other than the three already
recognized was a constant adventure for separatist agitators like Hochman. </big></p>

<p><big>Hochman's views on baptism can be detected in the following response to Christian
Liebe, </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>Hochmann von Hochenau to Christian Liebe </big></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>Concerning the matter of the baptism, it is my impartial opinion that baptism by
  fire and spirit must take place in every Christian. Where this does not occur in the soul,
  the outward water baptism alone without the inward one can make a Christian of no one.
  Before God in Christ, only the new creature has value. In faith working through love is
  found the entire essence of Christianity. Indeed, I believe that where one is outwardly
  baptized, even as an adult, that cannot possibly help one to salvation, if the person has
  not been inwardly sanctified in the body, soul, and spirit of Jesus.221 </big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big>Likewise with communion, </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>When this is held by living members of Christ in truly united love, then I will
  not oppose it. To the contrary, in as far as they wish to ally themselves with me in life
  and death for the sake of the name of Jesus, I will take communion with them. However,
  without the inward alliance with the spirit of Jesus, the outward will avail little or
  nothing at all.222 </big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big>Here we see in Hochman an example of complete inward focus, usually only found
among quietists such as Quakers. </big></p>

<p><big>When the official tried to enlist the aid of the reformed pastor in an
inquisitorial fashion, he found that the pastor was a moderate, uninterested in being a
Taufjager [baptist hunter]. </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>Inspector Konig to Count Charles August </big></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>If there is anything wrong with this type of baptismal act, it is that their
  baptism is commonly not a sacrament of unity and brotherly fellowship with all believers
  and God-fearing people but rather a sacrament of separation and partisan spirit.223 </big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big>Of course in Hochman's view, no one could have been less partisan than he, since
he did not recognized the validity of any confessional distinctions. </big></p>

<h3><big>Mack</big></h3>

<p><big>Alexander Mack wrote three tracts that we know of, but only two survive. Also one
letter remains. The titles are a little hard to remember. One is, </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>A Short and Simple Presentation of the Outward, yet Sacred Rights and Ordinances
  of the House of God, as Commanded by the True Steward Jesus Christ, and Left on Record in
  His Last Will and Testament. Arranged in a Conversation between Father and Son through
  Questions and Answers. 224 </big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big>For obvious reasons historians refer to this work as <i>Rechte und Ordnungen</i>,
[Rites and Ordinances]. </big></p>

<p><big>The other work that has survived has a similarly long title, but is usually called
<i>Ground Searching Questions </i>[<i>Grundforschende Fragen</i>]. 225 </big></p>

<p><big>The other main source matter comes from Alexander Mack Jr.'s Introduction to the
1774 edition of <i>Rites and Ordinances </i>which gives a short history of the formation
of the movement using some verbal and written materials he got from his father and Elder
Peter Becker, long time leader of the Germantown Brethren. 226 </big></p>

<p><big>Mack traveled and preached with Hochman for at least two years. He considered
himself Hochman's disciple until he decided to form a new church community that followed
the New Testament pattern more faithfully. In a letter to a critic, he explains his view
of the established churches: </big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big>The Baptist seed is still far better than the seed of L[uther], C[alvin], and also
  that of the C[atholics]. These have had a completely wild, yes, bestial outcome, which is
  self-evident. The Jews and the Turks are scandalized by the horrible wickedness of these
  three religions. Not even with gallows and torture can they keep them, who are of one
  faith, from murdering one another in their homes, which happens often enough. What is
  still more horrible, they go publicly to war, and slaughter one another by the thousands.
  All this is the fruit of infant baptism.227 </big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big>Their story begins in one of the most popular refuges for separatists in
Germany--Schwarzenau. Here Mack and his new wife came between 1700 and 1708. It was in
1708 that eight adults formed a <i>Gemeinde</i>, (parish or community) by having
themselves baptized three times forward in the name of the Father the Son, and the Holy
Spirit. 228 Hochman, who was opposed to all sects and all ecclesiastical organization, was
disappointed in his followers for forming a new sect.&quot;229 </big></p>

<p><big>Krefeld in northern Holland later became the center of the movement because of
even greater religious toleration there. Earlier, in 1678, Stephen Crisp, and English
Quaker, had established the first Quaker meeting at Krefeld. Two years later they were
driven out of town, and in 1683 most of them went to America. As already seen, the
Labadists had founded separatist cells there as well.230 </big></p>

<p><big>Mack's group were &quot;<i>taufgesinnten</i>&quot; which means baptism sectaries,
baptism variants, or baptism dissenters. The word is usually translated
&quot;baptists.&quot; They were also christened &quot;Tunkers&quot; [from tunkel- to dip]
and &quot;Dunkards.&quot; 231 Brethren historians refer to the movement as the German
Baptist Brethren. </big></p>

<p><big>Mack Jr. explains that &quot;Here and there private meetings (<i>Versammlungen</i>)
were established next to the organized churches, in which newly awakened souls sought
their edification. . .the [presence of] the spiritual priest [see above &quot;Church
Order&quot;] embittered the hearts of the rulers, and . . .persecutions were started. .
.&quot; 232 They were persecuted because they baptized adults, causing the nobility to
think that they were <i>Wiedertaufern </i>(Anabaptists). Civil authorities were terrified
of Anabaptism, for, &quot;it was essentially a lower class movement.&quot; </big></p>

<p><big>They eventually followed the Quakers to Penn's colony in America, where religious
toleration was practiced. Three books popular with the early Brethren were: Johann Arndt, <i>Wahres
Christendom</i>; Gottfried Arnold, <i>Abbildung der ersten Christen</i>; and Jeremais
Feldbinger, <i>Christliches Hand-Buchen</i>. 233 </big></p>

<p><big>Today the Brethren movement in America goes on under several denominational
labels. These include the Ashland Brethren, the Brethren in America, and the Grace
Brethren. 234</big></p>

<h3><big>The Legacy of Pietism in History</big></h3>

<p><big>The final impact of Pietism is so far reaching in history that it is impossible to
analyze fully here. The mere existence of the Wesleyan, Brethren and Moravian churches
indicate terrific impact. Then there was the effect on the Lutheran church. This has been
discussed in works by Stoeffler, Harnack, and Ritschl to name a few.235 </big></p>

<p><big>Pietism is usually admitted to have influenced numerous other churches including
the Mennonites, the Puritans, the Quakers, and Dutch Reformed in early America. We know
that the New England Puritan Cotton Mather corresponded with Francke for instance.236 </big></p>

<p><big>In society outside of the church, Pietism is credited with contributing to the
impetus for a spirit of tolerance and religious freedom.237 Johann Wolfgang Goethe, and
Immanuel Kant are examples of important secular thinkers who were heavily exposed to
Pietism in their youth. Noll even [wrongly, I think] goes as far as seeing Pietistic
influence in Jansenism and the visions of the Jewish mystic Baal Shem Tov!238 </big></p>

<p><big>Some of the evaluations of Pietism's impact are quite negative.239 It is hard to
deny that hyper-individualism is a danger inherent in the movement. Today, much of
American fundamentalism draws its primarily inward devotional ethic from Pietistic
sources. In a different vein, Noll, speaking from an apparently sentimental, rather than a
biblical perspective, worries that Pietism &quot;can underrate the value of Christian
traditions.&quot;240 Others would say that this is the main value of the movement. </big></p>

<p><big>Regarding Ecclesiology, the great themes that Spener brought to light in the area
of lay-ministry are arguably the most revolutionary and positive truths uncovered by the
Reformation. The outburst of excitement for Christianity that resulted (even though
temporary in many cases) was enough to impact most of the world before it had spent its
force. </big></p>

<p><big>Heyd points out that we need to consider not only the moves made by the Pietists
and related &quot;inner life&quot; groups, but also to study the reaction of the
established churches. </big></p>

<p><big>The reactions of the establishment itself, or of `structure' to the challenges of
the radicals has usually received less attention, although such a reaction may be no less
interesting . . .than the thought and action of the radicals.241 </big></p>

<p><big>He points out that &quot;the `anti-structural' character of enthusiasm was
stressed above all by its contemporary critics.&quot; As a result, It was, &quot;. .
.important to emphasize the time-bound character of scripture and to supplement it by a
reliance on the Church as the embodiment of the religious order and as the only legitimate
interpreter of the scriptural message.&quot;242 Thus, like the Quakers, the &quot;latitude
men&quot; and the Anabaptists, the Pietists may have had the unintended effect in some
confessions of stiffening institutional criteria for authority. </big></p>

<p><big>By far more significant however, are two central emphases reintroduced by the
Pietists, that have remained as key elements of much of conservative Christianity
especially in America. These are the emphasis on a personal relationship with God (usually
attended by the belief in the need for a defined conversion experience) and the emphasis
on evangelism and missions. Both of these have a bearing on ecclesiology. </big></p>

<p><big>The distinction between true (i.e. converted) Christians and nominal Christians
relates to the definition of the true, or invisible, church. As already seen, this
tendency led in part to the separatism of the radicals, and has led to various attempts at
founding &quot;believers only&quot; churches.243 This development has tended to fade in
importance because of the difficulties inherent in the view. However, the distinction has
continued to carry weight with fundamentalist groups, many of which have set out to
convert the nominal Christians in existing churches. </big></p>

<p><big>The emphasis on missions has had a resounding impact in redefining the nature of
the church's mission. Views that the church is simply intended to worship rightly, and to
season society have tended to be considered incomplete by Pietistically-oriented churches
and parachurch groups. This has had the effect of birthing the modern missionary movement.
The role of Halle in initiating this movement, (not to mention the work of the Methodists)
should not be underrated. </big></p>

<p><big>Finally, there are several likely points of contact between secular intellectual
history in Europe and Pietism, all of which lie outside the scope of this paper.</big></p>

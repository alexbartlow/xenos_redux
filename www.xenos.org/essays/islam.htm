<h1>Background of Islam</h1>
<hr>
<h2>I. HISTORY AND EVENTS </h2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Muhammad, the founder of Islam was 
  born in Mecca (in modern day Saudi Arabia) in A.D. 570. At that time, the religious 
  setting of the Arabian Peninsula was &quot;a rather primitive polydemonism and 
  worship of stones, stars, caves and trees.</FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A></SUP><FONT SIZE=3> 
  Around A.D. 610 he came to believe he was receiving visions, which he claimed 
  were from the angel Gabriel. The Islamic scriptures, known as the &quot;Koran,&quot; 
  are the &quot;reciting&quot; of the revelations he claimed to have received 
  for the next 22 years.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Muhammad's preaching of these visions 
  in Mecca met with considerable resistance. The reason for this was because Muhammad's 
  message threatened not only popular polytheism, but the political and economic 
  powers. As a result, Muhammad found his first followers among the lower class 
  and those who were ripe for a new social order. </FONT> </P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>In 622 he traveled to Yathrib, which 
  is now called Medina. This event, called the &quot;Hejira,&quot; is viewed as 
  the turning point of Islam. From then on, Islam was no longer just a religion 
  but a distinct political power. In Medina, the community of believers became 
  a state with Muhammad as its religious and political leader.</FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>In 630, Muhammad and his followers 
  took over Mecca without resistance. Muhammad declared the Kaaba (the temple 
  in Mecca) was the holiest shrine in Islam. To this day, Muslims direct their 
  prayers facing the city of Mecca and the shrine of Kaaba.</FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote3anc" HREF="#sdfootnote3sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>By the time Muhammad died in 632, Islam 
  had already reached large portions of Asia, Africa and part of Europe. Today, 
  Islam claims over 450 million followers.</FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote4anc" HREF="#sdfootnote4sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A></SUP><FONT SIZE=3> 
  According to Carmody and Carmody, &quot;Islam is the world's fastest growing 
  religion today. It is a great force in Africa, a middling presence in China 
  and the Soviet Union, a shareholder in the petropolitics of the Middle East, 
  a huge presence in Indonesia, and the religion of more than 6 million North 
  Americans.&quot;</FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote5anc" HREF="#sdfootnote5sym"><SUP>5</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<hr>
<h2>II. TEACHINGS OF ISLAM</h2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The faith and practice of Islam 
  are governed by the two great branches of Muslim learning, theology and jurisprudence, 
  to both of which some reference has already been made. Muslim theology (usually 
  called &quot;Tawhid&quot; from its central doctrine of the Unity of the Godhead) 
  defines all that a man should believe, while the law (Shari'a) prescribes everything 
  that he should do. There is no priesthood and no sacraments... Unlike any other 
  system in the world today the Shari'a embraces every detail of human life, from 
  the prohibition of crime to the use of the toothpick, from the organization 
  of the State to the most sacred intimacies -- or unsavory aberrations -- of 
  family life.&quot;</FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote6anc" HREF="#sdfootnote6sym"><SUP>6</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>These practices are mainly true of 
  Sunni Islam, not of the divergent sects.</FONT></P>
<h3 STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A. The Articles of Faith</h3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>These are basic doctrines every Muslim 
  is required to believe.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;O believers, believe in God and 
  His messenger and the Book He has sent down before. Whoso disbelieves in God 
  and his angels and His books, and His Messengers, and the Last Day, has surely 
  gone astray into far error. Those who believe, and then disbelieve, then believe, 
  then disbelieve, and then increase in unbelief--God is not likely to forgive 
  them, neither to guide them on any way.&quot; (<U>The Koran</U>, Sura 4:135)</FONT></P>
<ol>
  <li><FONT SIZE=3><U>God</U>-- There is one true God and His name is &quot;Allah&quot;; 
    Allah is all-seeing, all-knowing, and all-powerful. Yet, Allah is not a personable, 
    but a transcendent God, for He is so far above man that He is not personally 
    knowable.<br>
    <br>
    </FONT><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Say: 'He is God, One, God, the Everlasting Refuge, 
    who has not begotten, and was not begotten, and equal to Him is not any one.&quot;</FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote7anc" HREF="#sdfootnote7sym"><SUP>7</SUP></A><br>
    <br>
    </SUP></li>
  <li><FONT SIZE=3><U>Angels</U>-- The chief angel is Gabriel, who was instrumental 
    in revealing the visions to Muhammad. Different than angels are the jinn (jeanies 
    or demons). The leader of the jinn is Shaitan (Satan).<br>
    <br>
    </FONT> </li>
  <li><FONT SIZE=3><U>Scripture</U>-- There are four books Muslims consider inspired: 
    the Torah of Moses (first five books of the Old Testament), the Zabur (Psalms 
    of David), the Injil, (the gospel of Jesus) and the Koran. Muslims believe 
    the former three contain error because they have been tampered with by Jews 
    and Christians. Since the Koran is God's most recent and final word, it is 
    viewed as superior to all other writings.<br>
    <br>
    </FONT> <FONT SIZE=3>When asked for a miracle to attest his claim to be a 
    prophet, Muhammad would refer to the miracle of the Koran. &quot;Qur'an&quot; 
    (or &quot;Koran&quot;) is an Arabic word which means &quot;recite.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    </FONT><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It is seen as a perfect revelation of God, faithful 
    reproduction of an original engraved on a tablet in heaven which has existed 
    from all eternity. Copies of the Qur'an are therefore venerated very highly 
    and are only touched and read by Muslims after ceremonial cleansing. According 
    to Islamic tradition, the Qur'an was originally written on palm leaves, on 
    shoulder-blade bones of camels and on stones.<br>
    <br>
    </FONT><FONT SIZE=3>Following Muhammad's death in A.D. 632, tradition states 
    that the first caliph, Abu Bakr, ordered Muhammad's former secretary, Zaid, 
    to collect and arrange writings. This was done in cooperation with other and 
    finally an authorized revision of the text was established by Caliph Uthman. 
    Other versions in existence were ordered to be destroyed.&quot; </FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote8anc" HREF="#sdfootnote8sym"><SUP>8</SUP></A><br>
    <br>
    </SUP></li>
  <li><FONT SIZE=3><U>Judgment Day</U> --On the last day the dead will be resurrected. 
    Allah will judge each person according to their deeds, sending them to heaven 
    or hell. Heaven is a place of sensual pleasure.<br>
    <br>
    </FONT><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;For many men the best part of the heavenly garden 
    was the <I>bur</I>: dark-eyed buxom virgins. In addition to his earthly wife, 
    each male in heaven could expect to have seventy <I>bur</I>. They would never 
    be sick, menstruating, pregnant (unless he wished), bad-tempered, or jealous.&quot; 
    He would be able to de-flower them at will, and return to find them virgins 
    again. </FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote9anc" HREF="#sdfootnote9sym"><SUP>9</SUP></A><br>
    <br>
    </SUP></li>
  <li><FONT SIZE=3><U>Prophets</U> -- The Koran lists 28 prophets, including Adam, 
    Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Jonah and Jesus. Muhammad is the last and greatest 
    prophet.</FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote10anc" HREF="#sdfootnote10sym"><SUP>10</SUP></A><br>
    <br>
    </SUP></li>
  <li><FONT SIZE=3><U>Predestination</U> --Allah has determined what he pleases 
    and no one can change what he has decreed.</FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote11anc" HREF="#sdfootnote11sym"><SUP>11</SUP></A></SUP><FONT SIZE=3> 
    This is a sixth article of faith that is considered by many to be part of 
    the five articles.<br>
    <br>
    </FONT><FONT SIZE=3>This strong fatalism has played a central role in Muslim 
    culture, and may be connected to the lack of modern progress that has characterized 
    Muslim countries until recently.</FONT></li>
</ol>
<h3>B. The Five Pillars of Faith</h3>
<ol>
  <li><FONT SIZE=3><U>The Creed (Shahada)</U>-- &quot;There is no God but Allah 
    and Muhammad is his Prophet.&quot; This must be stated publicly to become 
    a Muslim. The creed is repeated regularly by worshipers.</FONT></li>
  <li><FONT SIZE=3><U>Prayer (Salat)</U>-- </FONT><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The practice 
    of prayer (salat) is five times a day (upon rising, at noon, in midafternoon, 
    after sunset, and before retiring). The worshiper must recite the prescribed 
    prayers (the first surah and other selections from the Koran) in Arabic while 
    facing the Ka'aba in Mecca. The Hadith (book of tradition) has turned these 
    prayers into a mechanical procedure of standing, kneeling, hands and face 
    on the ground, and so forth. The call to prayer is sounded by the muezzin 
    (a Muslim crier) from a tower called a minaret which is part of the mosque 
    (the place of public worship)&quot;</FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote12anc" HREF="#sdfootnote12sym"><SUP>12</SUP></A></SUP></li>
  <li><FONT SIZE=3><U>Almsgiving (Zakat)</U>-- Muslims are required to give one-fortieth 
    of their income to help the poor.</FONT></li>
  <li><FONT SIZE=3><U>Fasting (Ramadan)</U>-- Faithful Muslims fast from sunrise 
    to sunset everyday during this holy month.</FONT></li>
  <li><FONT SIZE=3><U>The Pilgrimage (Hajj)</U>-- The Pilgrimage to Mecca is expected 
    of every Muslim at least once in their lifetime, unless prevented by war or 
    other conditions beyond the worshipper's control. </FONT><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It 
    is the duty of all men towards God to come to the House a pilgrim, if he is 
    able to make it there.&quot;</FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote13anc" HREF="#sdfootnote13sym"><SUP>13</SUP></A> 
    </SUP><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The Kaaba (in Mecca) is the most sacred place for 
    believers. Much more than a mosque, it is believed to be the place where heavenly 
    power touches the earth directly. &quot;</FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote14anc" HREF="#sdfootnote14sym"><SUP>14</SUP></A></SUP></li>
</ol>
<h3>C. Holy War</h3>
<p><FONT SIZE=3> There is a sixth religious duty associated with the Five Pillars, 
  Jihad or Holy War.</FONT></p>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Koran teaches:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Prescribed for you is fighting, though it be hateful 
  to you. Yet it may happen that you will hate a thing which is better for you; 
  and it may happen that you will love a thing which is worse for you; God knows, 
  and you know not.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They will question thee concerning the holy month, 
  and fighting in it. Say: `Fighting in it is a heinous thing, but to bar from 
  God's way, and disbelief in Him, and the Holy Mosque, and to expel its people 
  from it--that is more heinous in God's sight; and persecution is more heinous 
  than slaying. They will not cease to fight with you..." (Sura 2:212).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> "So let them fight in the way of God who sell the 
  the present life for the world to come; and whosoever fight in the way of God 
  is slain, or conquers, We shall bring him a mighty wage. How is it with you, 
  that you do not fight in the way of God, and for the men, women, and children 
  who, being abased, say, `Our Lord, bring us forth from this city whose people 
  are evildoers, and appoint to us a protector from Thee, and appoint to us from 
  Thee a helper'? The believers fight in the way of God, and the unbelievers fight 
  in the idols' way. Fight you therefore against the friends of Satan; surely 
  the guile of Satan is ever feeble" (Sura 4:77). </P>
<p>Islamic scholars explain: </p>
<p></p>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Jihad literally means an effort 
  or striving. It includes a religious war against unbelievers with the object 
  of converting them to Islam or subduing all opposition. (See <U>Koran</U> 9:5; 
  4:76; 2:214; 8:39.) It is the sacred duty of the Muslim nation to ensure that 
  Islam triumphs over all religions. It is considered a general duty of the nation 
  as a whole, not of individuals. Furthermore, it is a duty which relates only 
  to religion. It has nothing to do with economic exploitation, political repression 
  or imperialism in any form.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>In his early career Mohammed spread 
  Islam by teaching and persuasion: several early Meccan suras stated that he 
  was sent only to preach. When, at Medina, he declared that God had allowed him 
  and his followers to defend themselves against infidels, and later when he proclaimed 
  that he had divine leave to attack them and set up the true faith by the sword. 
  Muhammad himself fought in nine battles and ordered many more.&quot;</FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote15anc" HREF="#sdfootnote15sym"><SUP>15</SUP></A></SUP><BR>

<ol>
  <li><FONT SIZE=3><U>God</U>-- Muslims deny the doctrine of the trinity, considering 
    it polytheistic. They consider it blasphemous to call God &quot;Father&quot; 
    because it implies to them that He had sexual relations.<br>
    <br>
    </FONT><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This doctrine, which makes God different from His 
    creatures, is strong in Islam. Allah is so different that it makes it (1) 
    difficult to really know very much about him, and (2) unlikely that he is 
    affected by his creatures' attitudes or actions. Although Allah is said to 
    be loving, this aspect of his nature is almost ignored, and his supreme attribute 
    of justice is thought to overrule love. &quot;</FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote16anc" HREF="#sdfootnote16sym"><SUP>16</SUP></A></SUP><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><FONT SIZE=3><U>The Bible</U>-- The Muslims trace their roots to the Bible, 
    but feel free to pick and choose the parts that support their view. Islam, 
    for example, would not consider our New Testament to be the Injil (gospel 
    of Jesus). It is not the words of Jesus, it is others' words about Jesus. 
    His original words have been corrupted and many have been lost. Only the Qur'an 
    is infallible. Muhammad and the Qur'an are that which Islam is to follow.</FONT><br>
    <br>
    <FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It is well known that at many points the Qur'an does not 
    agree with the Jewish and Christian Scriptures. Therefore, from the Muslim 
    point of view, it follows of necessity that these Scriptures must have been 
    corrupted. Historical evidence makes no impression on the crushing force of 
    the syllogism. So it is, and it can be no other way. The Muslim controversialist 
    feels no need to study evidence in detail. The only valid picture of Jesus 
    Christ is that which is to be found in the pages of the Qur'an.&quot;</FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote17anc" HREF="#sdfootnote17sym"><SUP>17</SUP></A></SUP><br>
    <br>
    <FONT SIZE=3>References to the Bible in the Koran make it evident that Muhammad 
    was confused about the message of Christianity and also what the Old Testament 
    said. In Gleason Archer's study we find that there are blatant anachronisms 
    and historical inaccuracies in the Koran.</FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote18anc" HREF="#sdfootnote18sym"><SUP>18</SUP></A></SUP><FONT SIZE=3> 
    If God revealed the Koran, he not only contradicted some of his earlier revelation 
    in the Old and New Testaments (including the parts that Muslims consider to 
    be inspired) but he forgot some of the historical details of his own revelation. 
    The distinction between what are Christ's actual words and what was &quot;corrupted&quot; 
    by Christians is completely arbitrary, leaving the Muslim interpreter as the 
    final authority.</FONT><br>
    <br>
    <FONT SIZE=3>As was pointed out earlier, when Muhammad was asked to validate 
    his prophetic claim, he neither claimed to be divine, nor to have been raised 
    from the dead. Rather, he pointed to the miracle of the Qur'an. Unfortunately, 
    the book lends itself neither to falsification nor verification. There is 
    no predictive prophecy such as that used by the God of the Bible to verify 
    his word. </FONT> </li>
</ol>
<h3>The Koran's view of women</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In the Koran's teaching on women, we see a striking difference from the Bible. 
</p>
<p><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Men are the managers of the affairs of women for that God 
  has preferred in bounty one of them over another, and for that they have expended 
  of their property. Righteous women are therefore obedient, guarding the secret 
  for God's guarding. And those you fear may be rebellious admonish; banish them 
  to their couches, and beat them. If they then obey you, look not for any way 
  against them&quot; (Sura 4:34).</FONT></p>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>In these few words, God has made known 
  the status of women in relation to men. In relation to other matters the status, 
  rights and duties of women are defined with various degrees of rigidity, but 
  in this the message is clear, finite and complete; it is not a matter for discussion 
  or compromise. The Koran also states:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>'Your women are a tillage for you; 
  so come unto your tillage as you wish' (Sura 2:223).&quot;</FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote19anc" HREF="#sdfootnote19sym"><SUP>19</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The following passage is a summary 
  of Islamic attitudes on women given by Denise Carmody:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The status of women in Islam says a 
  great deal about Muslim society. In the Qur'an there is some basis for sexual 
  equality: Reward and punishment in the afterlife depend on deeds, not gender; 
  marriage and conjugal life are precious; women have dowry rights in some divorces, 
  inheritance rights, rights to remarry, and rights to protection in time of pregnancy 
  and nursing. However, women's rights were not equal to those that the Qur'an 
  gave males in either divorce or inheritance. Moreover, the Qur'an does not even 
  consider the possibility that women might assume leadership roles in the community, 
  receive an education equal to that of males, teach law or theology, or engage 
  in polygamy (as males could).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Furthermore, the misogyny latent in 
  most patriarchal religions had dark effects in Muslim society. As late as 1970, 
  an Arab sheik offered the opinion that &quot;educated or not a woman is a woman 
  and the Prophet--God's prayers and peace on him--had said that women are lacking 
  in mind and religion. The tradition placed more women in the Fire than in the 
  Garden, and the prime determinant of their destiny was their treatment of their 
  husbands. In legend Muhammad virtually despised female nature as stupid and 
  irreligious. Its specific defects were menstruation, which interfered with prayer 
  and fasting, and unreliability, which made a woman's witness worth only half 
  a man's in court. Obedience to her husband was the woman's first duty; failure 
  to obey can still get her killed today.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The Muslim woman was considered erotic 
  and empty-headed. Thus she was subject to purdah (seclusion and veiling), polygyny, 
  concubinage and the harem. Women were not to be taught to read and write (&quot;a 
  great calamity&quot;), and they were morally &quot;bent&quot; because they came 
  from Adam's bent rib. Thus, in many men's eyes, they had a dismal existence: 
  &quot;It were best for a girl not to come into existence, but being born she 
  had better be married or buried.&quot; Recent Muslims, especially Africans, 
  have defended clitoridectomy and kindred operations, frequently with the following 
  sort of rationale: &quot;Circumcision of women releases them from their bondage 
  to sex, and enables them to fulfill their real destiny to mother.&quot; </FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote20anc" HREF="#sdfootnote20sym"><SUP>20</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<h3 STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Other Problems with the Koran</h3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Another reason for suspicion in regard 
  to the Koran's authenticity is cited by Christy Wilson:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;There are alterations and abrogations 
  within the Qur'an itself. For example, Muhammad originally ordered his followers 
  to pray towards Jerusalem (sura 2:150), but when the Jewish people refused to 
  follow him, he changed the direction of prayer to Mecca (sura 2:125). Such alterations 
  are explained by sura 2:106, `If we abrogate a verse or consign it to oblivion, 
  we offer something better than it or something of equal value.'&quot;</FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote21anc" HREF="#sdfootnote21sym"><SUP>21</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<h3 STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Koran and Jesus Christ</h3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The Koran denies that Jesus was God, 
  although it describes the virgin birth in a passage similar to Luke 1:26-38 
  (Sura 3:45-47). Islam does believe Jesus was a sinless prophet though not as 
  great as Muhammad. </FONT> </P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;People of the Book, go not beyond 
  the bounds in your religion, and say not as to God but the truth. The Messiah, 
  Jesus son of Mary, was only the Messenger of God, and His word that He committed 
  to Mary, and a Spirit from Him. So believe in God and His Messengers, and say 
  not, `Three.' Refrain; better is it for you. God is only One God.&quot;</FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote22anc" HREF="#sdfootnote22sym"><SUP>22</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;They are unbelievers who say, 
  `God is the Messiah, Mary's son.' For the Messiah said, `Children of Israel, 
  serve God, my Lord and . . . . They are unbelievers who say, `God is the Third 
  of Three.' No god is there but One God. If they refrain not from what they say, 
  there shall afflict those of them that disbelieve a painful chastisement. Will 
  they not turn to God and pray His forgiveness? God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate. 
  The Messiah, son of Mary, was only a Messenger; Messengers before him passed 
  away; his mother was a just woman; they both ate food. Behold, how We make clear 
  the signs to them; then behold, how they perverted are!&quot; </FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote23anc" HREF="#sdfootnote23sym"><SUP>23</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>It should be pointed out that Jesus 
  left no room for such a claim (Jn. 8:58; 10:30; 14:6).</FONT></P>
<h4 STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Regarding the crucifixion, the Koran states: </h4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot; And for their unbelief, and 
  their uttering against Mary a mighty calumny, and for their saying, `We slew 
  the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, the Messenger of God'--yet they did not slay 
  him, neither crucified him, only a likeness of that was shown to them. Those 
  who are at variance concerning him surely are in doubt regarding him; they have 
  no knowledge of him, except the following of surmise; and they slew him not 
  of a certainty--no indeed; God raised him up to Him; God is All-mighty, All-wise.&quot;</FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote24anc" HREF="#sdfootnote24sym"><SUP>24</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The death of Christ at the hand 
  of the Jews is rejected by Muslims on a priori grounds, which are absolutely 
  convincing if the major premise is admitted. It is impossible that God should 
  so desert a prophet in the fulfillment of his mission. It would be contrary 
  to His justice to permit the suffering of an innocent on behalf of others. It 
  would be contrary to His omnipotence not to be able to rescue a prophet in danger. 
  Therefore Jesus cannot have been left helpless in the hand of his enemies.&quot;</FONT><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote25anc" HREF="#sdfootnote25sym"><SUP>25</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Most Muslims believe Judas died on 
  the cross, not Jesus. Here again, the historical reliability of the New Testament 
  documents are being denied without evidence by a book with less credibility.</FONT></P>
<h3>The Koran on Sin and Salvation</h3>
<p><FONT SIZE=3>As we have seen above, the Muslim must earn salvation by good 
  works. This contradicts the Torah (Gen. 15:6), which Islam affirms as being 
  from Allah. Islam cannot explain how a righteous God can accept sinful men without 
  compromising his own moral character. It is also unclear where the cut off line 
  is between a saved Muslim and an unsaved Muslim. It does not require keeping 
  the laws perfectly, but neither does Islam specify how close you have to come 
  to be given eternal life. </FONT> </p>

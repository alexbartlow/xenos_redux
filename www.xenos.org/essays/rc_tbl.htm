<h1><font size="+1">Evangelicals today have to decide how they stand relative 
  to the Roman Catholic church in light of recent history. Several prominent evangelicals 
  have called on the church to sign an accord expressing unity in the Body of 
Christ, which, they argue includes the Catholic Church.</font></sub> </h1>

<p><font size="+1">At Xenos, we <a href="../classes/um1-1a.htm">define the 
  church </a>in a way that is incompatible with this declaration, regardless of 
  whether or not we view Catholic doctrine as sufficiently close to ours to warrant 
  some level of cooperation. At Xenos, we would not sign a declaration that <b>any</b> 
  church institution (including our own) lies entirely within the circle of the 
  Body of Christ. At the same time, we would not deny the true Christianity of 
  particular individuals within churches which may not teach evangelical doctrine. 
  Therefore, in our view, the command to cultivate unity would apply only to that 
  part of any church composed of people truly spiritually reborn. This is why 
  we have not agreed to sign onto this accord.</sub> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">During our discussions with leaders outside Xenos on this 
  issue, we have been challenged to consider the changes in Catholic doctrine 
  embodied in the new Catechism. Therefore, senior pastor, Dennis McCallum took 
  a training paper by Jose Flores on Catholicism and updated it with teaching 
  from the new Catechism. This paper is helpful in assessing the new Catechism, 
  which in our view (and in the view of its authors), changes nothing in historic 
  Catholic teachings.</sub> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This paper is a good resource for those needing direct 
  citations from authoritative Catholic literature (see the important discussion 
  about sources in section 1). All citations are verbatim, and in context, and 
  all emphases are original unless otherwise noted. See the endnotes for exact 
  references.</sub> </font></p>

<h2><font size="+1"><a name="aboutsources">About the Sources</sub></a> </font></h2>
<h3><font size="+1">A. Scrutinize the Sources. </sub></font></h3>
<ol>
  <li><font size="+1">Volumes on the history and the doctrine of the Roman 
    Catholic church are legion. Authorship includes Catholics and Protestants 
    alike and they vary a great deal in accuracy and level of authority. Some 
    of the material written by non-Catholic authors is overly biased against the 
    Catholic church, just as Catholic sources may distort in their favor. Some 
    material is poorly documented, if at all.</sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Thus, the student of Catholic doctrine must evaluate 
    the sources in order to legitimately represent the object under analysis. 
    This is especially true when attempting to study a complicated subject such 
    as the doctrine of the Roman Catholic church. To be authoritative, study must 
    include material which the Catholic church has &quot;officially&quot; approved 
    as representing its teaching.</sub> </font></li>
</ol>
<h3><font size="+1">B. How to identify &quot;Official&quot; Catholic Church 
  Literature</sub></font></h3>
<ol>
  <li><font size="+1">There are two types of &quot;approval&quot; given by 
    the Catholic church to literature written about any aspect of the Catholic 
    church.</sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">The first type is the Nihil Obstat and <i>Imprimatur</i> 
    designation. <i>Nihil Obstat</i>, means, &quot;nothing stands in the way.&quot;<a href="#Footnote1">[footnote 
    1]</a> That is, it doesn't contradict Catholic doctrine. <i>Imprimatur</i> 
    literally means, &quot;let it be printed&quot;.<a href="#Footnote2">[footnote 
    2]</a> A Catholic official, usually a Bishop, approves the publishing of the 
    material. This designation is found on the front copyright page of an approved 
    document.</sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">However, it is important to note that this type of 
    approval is nothing but a permission to publish something non-heretical about 
    the Catholic church. But the source may include personal opinions which, while 
    not heretical, are not the official position of the church. The Nihil Obstat--Imprimatur 
    is not a formal declaration on the part of the Catholic church indicating 
    that the approved document officially represents Catholic doctrine.</sub> 
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">An official document published by the Catholic church 
    proper will identify itself as such. It will do so very clearly and at the 
    beginning of the document. Such documents include Papal &quot;encyclicals&quot; 
    (pamphlets), conciliar decrees (decrees of church councils), special post-conciliar 
    documents and a few &quot;catechisms&quot; (i.e., The Baltimore Catechism). 
    As of 1994, the church has released the Catechism of the Catholic Church.<a href="#Footnote3">[footnote 
    3]</a> This text is now considered the most modern, clear and authoritative 
    source of Catholic doctrine. While earlier authorized texts are still considered 
    true, most modern Catholics prefer to follow references in this new and improved 
    text. Therefore, it has become the definitive text for Catholic doctrine. 
    Other text are still useful for comparison.</sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Those doctrines, modern or ancient, which the Catholic 
    church designates as infallible are given the status &quot;De-Fide.&quot; 
    De-Fide is a Latin term which literally means &quot;of faith&quot;.<a href="#Footnote4">[footnote

<h2><font size="+1"><a name="histevents">History and Events</sub></a> </font></h2>
<h3><font size="+1">A. The Primacy of Rome</sub></font></h3>
<ol>
  <li><font size="+1">At the beginning of Christianity the city of Rome already 
    was regarded as the center of civilization. Rome was also the capital of the 
    Roman empire through some of the fourth century AD. Thus, there were very 
    few early local churches whose leading members did not have to visit Rome 
    on occasion. So the church in Rome tended to have contact with more Christians 
    from all over the empire than did any of the other local churches.</sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">67 AD. is the generally accepted date of Peter's death. 
    At that time the Catholic church claims the second &quot;Pontiff,&quot; Linus, 
    succeeded Peter as the first Pope in Rome.<a href="#Footnote5">[footnote 
    5]</a> They claim this succession gave Rome its primacy over the other centers 
    of Christianity.</sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">The destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. served to remove 
    what would have been a major rival city. Had Jerusalem continued to exist, 
    historians reason that Rome would have had an even more difficult time asserting 
    its primacy. Ultimately, Jerusalem could have claimed to have given the gospel 
    to Rome. Most importantly, Peter would have been sent from Jerusalem to Rome; 
    thus Jerusalem would have been the &quot;alma mater&quot; and the prime city 
    of Christianity. (Tradition claims that Peter visited Rome, like Paul. And 
    tradition also claims that like Paul, Peter died in Rome).<a href="#Footnote6">[footnote 
    6]</a></sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">In approximately 96 AD., Clement of Rome (the Catholic 
    church's fourth Pope) wrote a letter of rebuke and admonishment to the church 
    at Corinth. Catholics cite this letter as corroborative evidence to prove 
    both the primacy of the church of Rome and the primacy of the Bishop of Rome. 
    The position taken by Clement is one of &quot;teacher&quot;.<a href="#Footnote7">[footnote 
    7]</a> He takes it upon himself to admonish the bishops in Corinth on matters 
    of faith and practice. This, they claim, showed that the bishop of Rome was 
    known even at this early date to be supreme.</sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Eusebius preserved a fragment of a letter written about 
    170 AD. by Dionysius, bishop of Corinth, to the Church of Rome. This letter 
    indicates that the Church of Rome already had a reputation for being hospitable 
    to strangers and for being very generous to other churches with their money.<a href="#Footnote8">[footnote 
    8]</a> Thus by merely suspending her friendly relations with another church, 
    especially a poor one in need, the church in Rome could inflict a severe penalty 
    on such a church.</sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Finally, in 312 A.D. Constantine won the battle of the Milvian Bridge. He attributed this victory to the &ldquo;god&rdquo; of the Christians, resulting in the Edict of Milan in 313 A.D. <a href="#Footnote9">[footnote 
  9]</a>which declared the toleration of all religions, including Christianity, throughout the empire. (although the adoption of Christianity as the official religion of the state did not occur until A.D. 380 under the reign of Theodosius I). This paved the way for the emergence of the Catholic church as a political power.</font></li>
</ol>
<h3><font size="+1"><a name="risepap">B. The Rise of the Papacy</sub></a> 
  </font></h3>
<ol>
  <li><font size="+1">Ultimately the rise of the papacy can be traced to 
    the rise of the primacy of Rome.</sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">In 256 AD., according to Cyprian, Stephen, bishop of 
    Rome claimed to be &quot;bishop of bishops&quot; on the basis of being Peter's 
    successor<a href="#Footnote10">[footnote 10]</a>.</sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">In 343 AD., at the Council of Serdicia, precedence 
    was given to the bishop of Rome. The eastern half of the Roman empire was 
    experiencing a doctrinal controversy with the Arians. Therefore it was felt 
    that if an eastern church needed the input of a high ranking church leader, 
    they should seek out Justin the bishop of Rome (because he was from the western 
    church). This was done to safeguard the churches in need of advise against 
    any possible Arian influence.<a href="#Footnote11">[footnote 11]</a> 
    </sub></font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">By 605 AD. the papacy was fully established. Boniface 
    III assumed the title &quot;Universal Bishop&quot;.</sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">In 1303 Pope Bonafice VIII issued the Bull &quot;Unum 
    Sanctum&quot;. This was the first papal address to the universal church and; 
    therefore, the first case of the Pope writing from his supposed infallible 
    position.<a href="#Footnote13">[footnote 13]</a></sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">In 1378 AD., the papacy experienced a schism; known 
    as the great Western Schism. After the death of Gregory XI, Urban VI was elected 
    but later rejected by the same electors. Clement VII was elected to replace 
    Urban VI. However, the Italian people were loyal to Urban VI, a fellow Italian, 
    while the French were loyal to Clement VII who was French. Ultimately, the 
    Catholic church deposed them both, and set up a new Pope, Boniface IX.<a href="#Footnote14">[footnote 
    14]</a> It should be noted that some Catholic historians don't even acknowledge 
    this schism because they don't acknowledge the election of Clement VII at 
    this time.<a href="#Footnote15">[footnote 15]</a></sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">By 1493 the papacy had grown into such a powerful political 
    and religious entity that it could grant ownership rights to entire sections 
    of the globe. &quot;In a series of bulls from 1493 to 1510, popes Alexander 
    VI and Julius II granted the Spanish kings the right of royal patronage over 
    the church in the newly discovered Americas<a href="#Footnote16">[footnote 
    16]</a>.</sub> </font></li>
</ol>
<h3><font size="+1">C. Other Events of Interest</sub></font></h3>
<ol>
  <li><font size="+1">The Council of Chalcedon, 451 AD., gave the same rights 
    and honors to the bishop of Constantinople as to the bishop of Rome.<a href="#Footnote17">[footnote 
    17]</a></sub> </font></li>

    summarized by seven major points<a href="#Footnote23">[footnote

    <ul>
      <li><font size="+1">He restricted the significance and value of indulgences

      <li><font size="+1">This true and actual forgiveness of penalties could 
        apply only to the living.</sub> </font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">There was no such thing as the treasury of merits.<a href="#Footnote24">[footnote 
        24]</a> In other words, he held that good works could not be applied to 
        the &quot;penitent&quot; Christian. The Church claimed the right to dispense 
        merits, usually after a donation was given. This was called an indulgence.</sub> 
        </font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Luther believed that the Pope should have granted 
        the indulgences free; that is, if in fact he really had the power to do 
        so.</sub> </font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Luther also drew a distinction between repentance 
        and the sacrament of penance (the confessing of sins to a priest for the 
        absolution of sins). He believed that a repentant sinner did not attempt 
        to escape punishment by indulgence but accepted it in humility and faith.<a href="#Footnote25">[footnote

      <li><font size="+1">True sorrow for sins (contrition) resulted in forgiveness

  <li><font size="+1">The Council of Trent, 1545-1563, was the Catholic church's 
    response Protestant Reformation. This is the time that the word &quot;Protestant&quot; 
    became popular; because men like Luther were &quot;protesting&quot; against 
    the Catholic church. The purpose of the council was to refute the Protestant 
    &quot;heresies&quot; and clearly state the &quot;orthodox&quot; (Catholic) 
    position. The result was the vigorous condemnation of all the reformers. Some 
    of the major statements of the council are listed as follows:<a href="#Footnote26">[footnote

        9. If anyone should say that by faith alone the sinner is justified, so 
        as to understand that nothing else is required to cooperate in the attainment 
        of the grace of justification, and that it is in no way necessary that 
        he be prepared and disposed by the action of his own will: let him be 
        anathema (cf. n. 798, 801, 804).&quot;<a href="#Footnote27">[footnote

        faith alone men obtain from God the grace of justification; let him be

        upon the Protestant reformers and anyone who believes the same. Religious 
        historians refer to this council as the council of the anathema's. Although 
        the Catholic church defines the word anathema as a &quot;solemn condemnation&quot;<a href="#Footnote30">[footnote 
        30]</a> it does not admit that with this term they consign someone hell. 
        &quot;Neither excommunication nor anathema's imply the Church's condemning 
        anyone to hell. That is the prerogative of God alone. Excommunication 
        is a Church law, excluding a notorious sinner from the communion of the 
        faithful (Canons 2257-2267)&quot;<a href="#Footnote31">[footnote

    Roman Pontiff when he speaks <i>ex cathedra</i>, that is when exercising the 
    office of pastor and teacher of all Christians, he defines with his supreme 
    apostolic authority a doctrine concerning faith or morals to be held by the 
    universal Church, through the divine assistance promised to him in St. Peter, 
    is possessed of that infallibility with which the divine Redeemer willed his

  <li><font size="+1">According to the Baltimore Catechism, &quot;The Catholic 
    church alone has Jesus Christ as its founder . . . She had been carrying on 
    her divinely appointed work of teaching the religion of Christ to mankind 
    for 15 centuries before Protestantism began . . . Thus all forms of Protestantism 
    are man made. And they are without divine sanction or approval.&quot;<a href="#Footnote40">[footnote 
    40]</a> In the new Catechism, we read, &quot;The sole Church of Christ [is 
    that] (sic) which our Savior, after his Resurrection, entrusted to Peter's 
    pastoral care . . . This church, constituted and organized as a society in 
    the present world, subsists in (<i>subsistit in</i>) the Catholic Church, 
    which is governed by the successor of Peter and by the bishops in communion 
    with him.&quot;<a href="#Footnote41">[footnote 41]</a></sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">The new Catechism quotes with approval the documents 
    of Vatican II on the subject of Ecumenism. &quot;For it is through Christ's 
    Catholic Church alone, which is the universal help toward salvation, that 
    the fullness of the means of salvation can be obtained. It was to the apostolic 
    college alone, of which Peter is the head, that we believe that our Lord entrusted 
    all the blessings of the New Covenant, in order to establish on earth the 
    one Body of Christ into which all those should be fully incorporated who belong 
    in any way to the People of God.&quot;<a href="#Footnote42">[footnote 
    42]</a></sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Other churches have arisen since the formation of the 
    Catholic church. These are &quot;rifts, which the Apostle strongly censures 
    as damnable.&quot; They also admit, &quot;often enough, men of both sides 
    were to blame.&quot;<a href="#Footnote43">[footnote 43]</a> Therefore 
    the reformers and the eastern fathers were in sin for dividing from the Roman 
    church. However, they also qualify this position, &quot;one cannot charge 
    with the sin of the separation those who at present are born into these communities 
    . . . All who have been justified by faith in Baptism are incorporated into 
    Christ; they therefore have a right to be called Christians, and with good 
    reason are accepted as brothers in the Lord by the children of the Catholic 
    Church.&quot;<a href="#Footnote44">[footnote 44]</a> Therefore there 
    is now a recognition that Protestants and others are also a part of the catholic 
    (universal) church as long as they have believed and been baptized.</sub> 
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">The catechism also recognized &quot;particular churches&quot; 
    which are local churches. &quot;The church of Christ is really present in 
    all legitimately organized local groups of the faithful, which in so far as 
    they are united to their pastors, are also quite appropriately called Churches 
    in the New Testament . . . In them the faithful are gathered together through 
    the preaching of the &quot;Gospel of Christ, and the mystery of the Lord's 
    supper is celebrated.&quot; The particular church is &quot;the diocese (or 
    eparchy), refers to a community of the Christian faithful in communion of 
    faith and sacraments with their bishop ordained in apostolic succession.&quot;<a href="#Footnote45">[footnote 
    45]</a> Because of the requirement for apostolic succession, &quot;Particular 
    churches are fully catholic through their communion with one of them, the 
    Church of Rome 'which presides in charity.' Indeed, 'from the incarnate Word's 
    descent to us, all Christian churches everywhere have held and hold the great 
    Church that is here [at Rome] (sic) to be their only basis and foundation 
    since, according to the Savior's promise, the gates of hell have never prevailed 
    against her.&quot;<a href="#Footnote46">[footnote 46]</a> In the 
    summary, the new catechism states it this way, &quot;The sole Church of Christ 
    which in the Creed we profess to be one, holy, catholic, and apostolic, . 
    . . (sic) subsists in the Catholic Church, which is governed by the successor 
    of Peter and by the bishops in communion with him. Nevertheless, many elements 
    of sanctification and of truth are found outside its visible confines.&quot;<a href="#Footnote47">[footnote 
    47]</a></sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">In the section &quot;Who belongs to the Catholic Church?&quot; 
    the new catechism makes some surprising statements. We read, &quot;All men 
    are called to this catholic unity of the People of God . . . And to it, in 
    different ways, belong or are ordered: the Catholic faithful, others who believe 
    in Christ, and finally all mankind, called by God's grace to salvation.&quot;<a href="#Footnote48">[footnote 
    48]</a> Later in this discussion we read, &quot;The plan of salvation also 
    includes those who acknowledge the Creator, in the first place amongst whom 
    are the Muslims; these profess to hold the faith of Abraham, and together 
    with us they adore the one, merciful God, mankind's judge on the last day.&quot;</sub> 
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Notwithstanding this statement, they go on to affirm 
    that the church &quot;is prefigured by Noah's ark, which alone saves from 
    the flood.&quot; Therefore, &quot;they could not be saved who, knowing that 
    the Catholic Church was founded as necessary by God through Christ, would 
    refuse either to enter into it or to remain in it.&quot; This is true unless 
    &quot;through no fault of their own, [they] do not know the Gospel of' Christ 
    or his Church, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and moved 
    by grace, try in their actions to do his will as they know it through the 
    dictates of their conscience--those too may achieve eternal salvation.&quot;<a href="#Footnote49">[footnote

  <li><font size="+1">Polity: The new catechism declares, &quot;Just as the 
    office which the Lord confided to Peter alone . . . is a permanent one, so 
    also endures the office . . . to be exercised without interruption by the 
    sacred order of bishops. . . .The Church teaches that 'the bishops have by 
    divine institution taken the place of the apostles as pastors of the Church, 
    in such ways that whoever listens to them is listening to Christ and whoever 
    despises them despises Christ and him who sent Christ.&quot;<a href="#Footnote50">[footnote

    still offers to the sacrament of the Eucharist the cult of adoration, not

      <li><font size="+1">Oral Tradition. &quot;Christ wrote nothing; neither 
        did He command the Apostles to write. He commissioned them to teach His 
        doctrines to all mankind, (Mt.28:19-20). The Apostles fulfilled the command 
        of Christ by their oral preaching. Peter, Matthew, John, James, and Jude 
        supplemented their preaching by writing. It is well to remember, however, 
        that the Church was a growing concern, a functioning institution, teaching, 
        preaching, administering the sacraments, saving souls, before the New 
        Testament ever saw the light of day.&quot;<a href="#Footnote53">[footnote

        faithfully fulfilled by the apostles who, by their oral preaching, by

        lips of Christ . . . in order to keep the gospel forever whole and alive 
        within the Church, the apostles left bishops as their successors, handing 
        over their own teaching role to them. This sacred tradition, therefore, 
        and sacred Scripture of both the Old and the New Testament are like a 
        mirror in which the pilgrim Church on earth looks at God . . . The words 
        of the holy Fathers (i.e., the ancient Fathers of the Church, early orthodox 
        Christian writers up to and including St. Gregory I in the West and St. 
        John of Damascus in the East.--Ed.) witness to the living presence of

        the living teaching office of the Church, whose authority is exercised 
        in the name of Jesus Christ. This teaching office is not above the word

    help of God's grace, one believes what God reveals not because its intrinsic 
    truth is perceived by the natural light of reason but on account of the authority 
    of God, who can neither deceive nor be deceived. However, the object of faith

    word of God and in tradition, and those which are proposed by the Church.&quot;<a href="#Footnote58">[footnote

    in baptism, the sacrament of faith.&quot;<a href="#Footnote59">[footnote

    the Christian participates in the grace of Christ.&quot;<a href="#Footnote60">[footnote

    baptism.</sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Merit. At the point of baptism, the merits of Christ 
    obtained by His obedience, death, and resurrection are applied. However this 
    application is not permanent. The baptized individual is only free from original 
    sin (the fall) and is empowered to perform the works of hope and charity, 
    without which faith is not sufficient. &quot;&quot;Since the initiative belongs 
    to God in the order of grace, no one can merit the initial grace of forgiveness 
    and justification, at the beginning of conversion. Moved by the Holy Spirit 
    and by charity, <i>we can then merit </i>for ourselves and for others the 
    graces needed for our sanctification, for the increase of grace and charity, 
    and for the attainment of eternal life.&quot; [emphasis original]<a href="#Footnote61">[footnote

  <li><font size="+1">Sanctification. It is intimately tied to salvation. 
    It has three steps. &quot;The first sanctification takes place at baptism, 
    by which the love of God is infused by the Holy Spirit (Romans 5:5). Newly 
    baptized persons are holy because the Holy Trinity begins to dwell in their 
    souls and they are pleasing to God. The second sanctification is a lifelong 
    process in which a person already in the state of grace grows in the possession 
    of grace and likeness to God by faithfully corresponding with divine inspirations. 
    The third sanctification takes place when a person enters heaven and becomes 
    totally and irrevocably united with God in the beatific vision.&quot;<a href="#Footnote62">[footnote

    Thus, the church decrees certain &quot;Precepts.&quot; &quot;The obligatory 
    character of these positive laws decreed by the pastoral authorities is meant 
    to guarantee to the faithful the indispensable minimum in the spirit of prayer 
    and moral effort, in the growth in love of God and neighbor.&quot;<a href="#Footnote65">[footnote 
    65]</a> The first precept is &quot;You shall attend Mass on Sundays and holy 
    days of obligation.&quot; The second is &quot;You shall confess your sins 
    at least once a year.&quot; The third is &quot;You shall humbly receive your 
    Creator in Holy Communion at least during the Easter season.&quot; The fourth 
    is, &quot;You shall keep hold the Holy days of obligation.&quot; The fifth 
    is, &quot;You shall observe the prescribed days of fasting and abstinence.&quot;

    Stated negatively, the doctrine of mortal sin states that sins which 
    destroy charity in the heart (such as adultery, perjury, murder or blasphemy) 
    necessitates a new initiative of God's mercy and a conversion of heart&quot; 
    through the sacrament of reconciliation.<a href="#Footnote67">[footnote 
    67]</a> Venial sins, (thoughtless chatter or immoderate laughter are the only 
    two listed) are forgiven at mass. &quot;Mortal sin . . . unless redeemed by 
    repentance and God's forgiveness, causes exclusion from Christ kingdom and 
    the eternal death of hell&quot;<a href="#Footnote68">[footnote 68]</a></sub></sub>

  <li><font size="+1">Sanctifying Grace. It is what empowers the Catholic 
    to perform the good works (charity) that are essential for salvation and growth. 
    &quot;Sanctifying grace is a supernatural gift which is a sharing in the nature 
    of God Himself and which raises men to the supernatural order, conferring 
    on them powers entirely above those proper to human nature.&quot;<a href="#Footnote69">[footnote 
    69]</a> It can be lost, however, by committing a mortal sin. It is gained

<h3><font size="+1"><a name="BM7sacs">E. The Seven Sacraments: </sub></a></font></h3>
<ol>
  <li><font size="+1">Definition. &quot;304. What is a sacrament? A sacrament 
    is an outward sign instituted by Christ to give grace...In each of the sacraments 
    there is an outward sign, that is, some external thing or action called the 
    matter, and a set formula of words known as the form. The matter and the form 
    together make up the sign of the sacrament...When the sign is applied to the 
    one who receives the sacrament, it signifies inward grace and has the power 
    of producing it in the soul.&quot;<a href="#Footnote70">[footnote 
    70]</a></sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Baptism. &quot;Baptism is that sacrament that gives 
    our souls the new life of sanctifying grace by which we become children of 
    God and heirs of heaven; Mt.28:18-20; Mk. 1:6-8; 16:15-16; Jn. 1:2; 3:5; Acts 
    2:38. Baptism takes away original sin; and also actual sins and all the punishment 
    due to them, if the person baptized be guilty of any actual sins and truly 
    sorry for them. Thus, children should be baptized as soon as possible after 
    birth. Parents commit a mortal sin if they neglect to do this.&quot;<a href="#Footnote71">[footnote 
    71]</a> &quot;Baptism is birth into a new life in Christ. In accordance with 
    the Lord's will, it is necessary for salvation, as is the Church herself, 
    which we enter by Baptism.&quot;<a href="#Footnote72">[footnote 
    72]</a> But later we read, &quot;Those who die for the faith, those who are 
    catechumens, and all those who, without know of the Church but acting under 
    the inspiration of grace, seek God sincerely and strive to fulfill his will, 
    are saved even if they have not been baptized.&quot;<a href="#Footnote73">[footnote 
    73]</a></sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Confirmation. The reception of confirmation is necessary 
    for the completion of baptismal grace.&quot;<a href="#Footnote74">[footnote 
    74]</a> &quot;Confirmation is the sacrament through which the Holy Ghost comes 
    to us in a special way and enables us to profess our faith as strong and perfect 
    Christians and soldiers of Christ&quot;<a href="#Footnote75">[footnote 
    75]</a> Jn.7:38-39; 16:7; Acts 2:1-4; 8:14-16; 19:5-6. &quot;The effect of 
    the sacrament of Confirmation is the full outpouring of the Holy Spirit as 
    once granted to the apostles at Pentecost.&quot;<a href="#Footnote76">[footnote 
    76]</a> Normally, confirmation should be performed by a bishop, but &quot;if 
    a Christian is in danger of death, any priest should give him Confirmation.&quot;<a href="#Footnote77">[footnote 
    77]</a></sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">The Holy Eucharist (Communion). &quot;The Eucharist 
    is thus a sacrifice because it re-presents (makes present) the sacrifice of 
    the cross . . . In this divine sacrifice which is celebrated in the Mass, 
    the same Christ who offered himself once in a bloody manner on the altar of 
    the cross is contained and is offered in an unbloody manner.&quot;<a href="#Footnote78">[footnote 
    78]</a> &quot;The Eucharistic sacrifice is also offered for the faithful departed 
    who 'have died in Christ but are not yet wholly purified,' so that they may 
    be able to enter into the light and peace of Christ.&quot;<a href="#Footnote79">[footnote 
    79]</a> The whole Christ is really, truly and substantially present in the 
    Holy Eucharist. We use the words really, truly and substantially to describe 
    Christ's presence in the Holy Eucharist in order to distinguish our Lord's 
    teaching from that of mere men who falsely teach that the Holy Eucharist is 
    only a sign or figure of Christ, or that He is present only by His power; 
    . . . Jn. 6:48-59; Mt. 26:26-28; Mk. 14:22-24; Lk. 22:19-20; I Cor. 11:23-29.&quot;<a href="#Footnote80">[footnote 
    80]</a> The Catholic Church applies John 6 to communion. &quot;The Lord addresses 
    an invitation to us, urging us to receive him in the sacrament of the Eucharist: 
    'Truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink 
    his blood, you have no life in you.'&quot;<a href="#Footnote81">[footnote 
    81]</a> <br>
    <br>
    The effects of taking Eucharist are profound. &quot;Life in Christ has its 
    foundation in the Eucharistic banquet: 'As the living Father sent me, and 
    I live because of the father, so he who eats me will live because of me.' 
    . . . Communion with the flesh of the risen Christ . . . preserves, increases 
    and renews the life of grace received at Baptism . . . The Eucharist cannot 
    unite us to Christ without at the same time cleansing us from past sins and 
    preserving us from future sins.&quot;<a href="#Footnote82">[footnote 
    82]</a> The catechism quotes with approval Ambrose: &quot;I should always 
    receive it, so that it may always forgive my sins. Because I always sin, I 
    should always have a remedy.&quot;<a href="#Footnote83">[footnote 
    83]</a> However, the Eucharist only forgives venial sins. It &quot;is not 
    ordered to the forgiveness of mortal sins -- that is proper to the sacrament 
    of Reconciliation.&quot;<a href="#Footnote84">[footnote 84]</a> 
    <br>
    <br>
    Eucharist only works when offered by either the Catholic or Orthodox priest. 
    The churches of the Reformation &quot;have not preserved the proper reality 
    of the Eucharistic mystery in its fullness, especially because of the absence 
    of the sacrament of Holy Orders [ordination of priests].&quot;<a href="#Footnote85">[footnote 
    85]</a> This is because &quot;Only validly ordained priests can preside at 
    the Eucharist and consecrate the bread and the wine so that they become the 
    Body and Blood of the Lord.&quot;<a href="#Footnote86">[footnote 
    86]</a></sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation. &quot;It is 
    called the sacrament of conversion because it makes sacramentally present 
    Jesus' call to conversion, the first step in returning to the Father from 
    whom one has strayed by sin. It is called the sacrament of Penance, since 
    it consecrates the Christian sinner's personal and ecclesial steps of conversion, 
    penance, and satisfaction . . . It is called the sacrament of forgiveness, 
    since by the priest's sacramental absolution God grants the penitent 'pardon 
    and peace.'&quot;<a href="#Footnote87">[footnote 87]</a> &quot;Penance 
    is the sacrament by which sins committed after Baptism are forgiven through 
    the absolution of the priest. Penance is a supernatural moral virtue which 
    prompts the sinner to detest his sins and incites him to offer satisfaction 
    for them and amend his life in the future.&quot;<a href="#Footnote88">[footnote 
    88]</a> The Catholic church claims that ultimately God is the one forgiving 
    the sins but that the priest receives the power from Jesus Christ on the basis 
    of IICor. 5:18,20 where apostles are &quot;given the ministry of reconciliation.&quot; 
    and Mt. 18:18, where &quot;bind,&quot; means excluded from communion.&quot;<a href="#Footnote89">[footnote 
    89]</a> <br>
    <br>
    Penance is for all sinners, but &quot;above all for those who, since Baptism, 
    have fallen to grave sin, and have thus lost their baptismal grace . . .&quot;<a href="#Footnote90">[footnote 
    90]</a> <br>
    <br>
    The sacrament of Penance includes three basic steps from the side of the sinner: 
    &quot;contrition, confession, and satisfaction.&quot;<a href="#Footnote91">[footnote 
    91]</a> Contrition is &quot;sorrow of the world and detestation for the sin 
    committed, together with the resolution not to sin again.&quot;<a href="#Footnote92">[footnote 
    92]</a> Such contrition forgives venial sins, but mortal sins only &quot;if 
    it includes the firm resolution to have recourse to sacramental confession 
    as soon as possible.&quot;<a href="#Footnote93">[footnote 93]</a> 
    The second is the act of confession. &quot;Confession to a priest is an essential 
    part of the sacrament of Penance.&quot;<a href="#Footnote94">[footnote 
    94]</a> All mortal sins (including violations of the last two commandments) 
    <i>must</i> be confessed and venial sins should also be confessed.<a href="#Footnote95">[footnote 
    95]</a> The third step is properly called penance which is the act of atoning 
    for ones sins, II Kings 12:13-14; Dan. 4:24; and Joel 2:12.<br>
    <br>
    Since Christ entrusted to his apostles the ministry of reconciliation, bishops 
    who are their successors, and priests, the bishops' collaborators, continue 
    to exercise this ministry. Indeed bishops and priests, by virtue of the sacrament 
    of Holy Orders, gave the power to forgive all sins 'in the name of the Father, 
    and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.'&quot;<a href="#Footnote96">[footnote 
    96]</a> &quot;The whole power of the sacrament of Penance consists in restoring 
    us to God's grace and joining us with him in an intimate friendship.&quot;<a href="#Footnote97">[footnote 
    97]</a> <br>
    <br>
    The act of atonement, in the third step, is based on the Catholic church's 
    view of punishment which is due to sin--eternal and temporal (see below). 
    God wants us to perform works of penance ourselves in order to receive all 
    the benefits of the satisfaction of Christ . . . Jn. 15:6; I Cor. 3:12-15; 
    Rev. 21:8.&quot;<a href="#Footnote98">[footnote 98]</a></sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Extreme Unction (Care of the Sick). &quot;Extreme Unction 
    is the sacrament which, through the anointing with blessed oil by the priest, 
    and through his prayer, gives health and strength to the soul and sometimes 
    to the body when we are in danger of death from sickness, accident, or old 
    age...Mk. 6:12-13; Js. 5:14-15.&quot;<a href="#Footnote99">[footnote 
    99]</a></sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Holy Orders. &quot;Holy Orders is the sacrament through 
    which men receive the power and grace to perform the sacred duties of bishops, 
    priest and other ministers of the Church.&quot;<a href="#Footnote100">[footnote 
    100]</a> <br>
    <br>
    The biblical basis for priesthood according to the new Catechism is Heb. 5:6;7:11 
    and Ps. 110:4. These all have to do with Christ's priesthood according to 
    the order of Melchizedek, which by inference they believe was passed to the 
    apostles in Mt. 16:18 and parallels.<a href="#Footnote101">[footnote 
    101]</a> <br>
    <br>
    Also, the church &quot;sees in the priesthood of Aaron and the service of 
    the Levites, as in the institution of the seventy elders, a prefiguring of 
    the ordained ministry of the New Covenant.&quot;<a href="#Footnote102">[footnote 
    102]</a> <br>
    <br>
    Priests have great authority. &quot;In the ecclesial service of the ordained 
    minister, it is Christ himself who is present to his Church as Head of his 
    Body, Shepherd of his flock, High priest of the redemptive sacrifice, Teacher 
    of Truth . . .In the beautiful expression of St. Ignatious of Antioch, the 
    Bishop is typos tou Patros: he is like the living image of God the Father.<a href="#Footnote103">[footnote 
    103]</a> &quot;The sacrament of Holy Orders communicates a 'sacred power' 
    which is none other than that of Christ.&quot;<a href="#Footnote104">[footnote 
    104]</a> <br>
    <br>
    The fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders is seen in bishops, which are 
    distinguished from presbyters in Catholic theology. &quot;By the imposition 
    of hands and through the words of the consecration, the grace of the Holy 
    Spirit is given, and a sacred character is impressed in such wise that bishops, 
    in an eminent and visible manner, take the place of Christ Himself, teacher, 
    shepherd, and priest, and act as his representative.&quot;<a href="#Footnote105">[footnote 
    105]</a> <br>
    <br>
    Priests also act as proxies for Christ. &quot;Through that sacrament priests 
    by the anointing of the Holy Spirit are signed with a special character and 
    so are configured to Christ the priest in such a way that they are able to 
    act in the person of Christ the head.&quot;<a href="#Footnote106">[footnote 
    106]</a> Once a clergyman receives this sacrament, he is changed spiritually 
    forever, and can never again be a lay person, even if barred from practicing 
    priestly functions. Ordination is forever.<a href="#Footnote107">[footnote 
    107]</a> Ordination is bestowed by bishops on baptized men who agree to celibacy 
    for life.<a href="#Footnote108">[footnote 108]</a><br>
    <br>
    Priests and bishops are enabled, by the sacrament of Holy Orders, to 
    turn the bread into flesh and the wine into blood during Eucharist.<a href="#Footnote109">[footnote 
    109]</a> Thus, Protestant ministers cannot effect transubstantiation, and 
    therefore cannot offer Eucharist that is effective at forgiving sins. (see 
    above, on Eucharist)<br>
    <br>
    The Sacrament of Holy Orders also gives the priest added sanctifying grace, 
    and gives him special supernatural powers; i.e. to change the bread and wine 
    into the body and blood of Christ (transubstantiation).</sub></sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Matrimony. &quot;Matrimony is the sacrament by which 
    a baptized man and a baptized woman bind themselves for life in a lawful marriage 
    and receive the grace to discharge their duties.&quot;<a href="#Footnote110">[footnote 
    110]</a> <br>
    <br>
    Divorce is simply not allowed for any reason whatsoever. The Catholic church 
    bases this view on Rom. 7:1-3; I Cor. 7:18-25; 7:39-40. An annulment (dissolution) 
    is granted on the basis that the marriage was never valid from the start.<a href="#Footnote111">[footnote 
    111]</a></sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">In March of 1966 the Catholic Church through its Sacred

<ol>
  <li><font size="+1">Indulgence. &quot;An indulgence is a remission before 
    God of the temporal punishment due to sins whose guilt has already been forgiven 
    . . .&quot;<a href="#Footnote113">[footnote 113]</a> Scriptures 
    used are Mt. 16:19-20; 2 Cor. 2:10, II Kings 24:1-25. Indulgences apply the 
    merits of Christ and the saints to the sinner in order to avoid or lessen 
    temporal punishment for sin. &quot;Grace sin deprives us of communion with 
    God and therefore makes us incapable of eternal life, the privation of which 
    is called the 'eternal punishment' of sin. On the other hand every sin, even 
    venial, . . . must be purified either here on earth, or after death in the 
    state called Purgatory.&quot;<a href="#Footnote114">[footnote 114]</a> 
    <br>
    <br>
    &quot;The 'treasury of the Church' is the infinite value, which can never 
    be exhausted, which Christ's merits have before God . . . This treasury includes 
    as well the prayers and good works of the Blessed Virgin Mary . . . In the 
    treasury, too, are the prayers and good works of all the saints.&quot;<a href="#Footnote115">[footnote 
    115]</a> <br>
    <br>
    There are two kinds of indulgences. The first is the &quot;plenary&quot; indulgence. 
    This removes all temporal punishment due to sin; and unless otherwise stated 
    it can only be gained once a day. The other kind of indulgence is a &quot;partial&quot; 
    one. The indulgence grants time off purgatory.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;An indulgence is obtained through the Church who, by virtue of the power 
    of binding and loosing granted her by Christ Jesus, intervenes in favor of 
    individual Christians and opens for them the treasury of the merits of Christ 
    and the saints to obtain from the Father of mercies the remission of the temporal 
    punishments due for their sins.&quot;<a href="#Footnote116">[footnote

  <li><font size="+1">The Mother of God. By giving birth to Jesus the Catholic 
    church concludes that she gave life to the world. &quot;Redeemed in an especially 
    sublime manner by reason of the merits of her Son, and united to Him by a 
    close and indissoluble tie, she is endowed with the supreme office and dignity 
    of being the Mother of the Son of God.&quot;<a href="#Footnote123">[footnote 
    123]</a></sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">The Immaculate Conception. Mary was born without original 
    sin. &quot;It is no wonder, then, that the usage prevailed among the holy 
    Fathers whereby they called the mother of God entirely holy and free from 
    all stain of sin, fashioned by the Holy Spirit into a new substance and new 
    creature.&quot;<a href="#Footnote124">[footnote 124]</a></sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Co-Redemtrix. Mary also shared in the sufferings of 
    Christ in such a way that she assists Christ in attaining salvation for men. 
    &quot;By thus consenting to divine utterance (Lk. 1:28), Mary, a daughter 
    of Adam, became the mother of Jesus. Embracing God's saving will with a full 
    heart and impeded by no sin, she devoted herself totally as a handmaid of 
    the Lord to the person and work of her son. In subordination to Him and along 
    with Him, by the grace of almighty God she served the mystery of redemption. 
    Rightly therefore the holy Fathers see her as used by God not merely in a 
    passive way, but as cooperating in the work of human salvation through free 
    faith and obedience.&quot;<a href="#Footnote125">[footnote 125]</a></sub> 
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">The Assumption of Mary into heaven. &quot;Finally, 
    preserved free from all guilt of original sin, the Immaculate Virgin was taken 
    up body and soul into heavenly glory upon the completion of her earthly sojourn. 
    She was exalted by the Lord as Queen of all, in order that she might be the 
    more thoroughly conformed to her Son, the Lord of lords (cf. Apoc. 19:6) and 
    the conqueror of sin and death.&quot;<a href="#Footnote126">[footnote 
    126]</a></sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">It should be noted that the Catholic church is still 
    not wholly &quot;decided&quot; as to the theology of her role. &quot;The synod 
    does not, however, have in mind to give a complete doctrine on Mary, nor does 
    it wish to decide those questions which have not yet been fully illuminated 
    by the work of theologians. Those opinions therefore may be lawfully retained 
    which are freely propounded by schools of Catholic thought concerning her 
    who occupies a place in the Church which is the highest after Christ and yet 
    very close to us.&quot;<a href="#Footnote127">[footnote 127]</a></sub>

<h2><font size="+1"><a name="conclusion">5 Conclusion</sub></a> </font></h2>
<h3><font size="+1">A. The Pillars of Catholic Doctrine</sub></font></h3>
<ol>
  <li><font size="+1">The whole of Catholic doctrine rests on its view of 
    the sources for divine revelation; namely, tradition, the Bible, and the teaching 
    office of the Catholic church.</sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">But even among these three sources, which they deem 
    equal in authority, the most crucial &quot;pillar&quot; is that of tradition. 
    As is evident in the quotations presented in this study, the tradition source 
    includes the oral and written elements. It is this source, primarily, that 
    the Catholic Church holds forth to prove that their line of popes succeeds 
    Peter. And again it is the source of tradition to which the Catholic church 
    chiefly refers to support the primacy of the &quot;Roman&quot; Catholic church. 
    Thus, without proof for the papal succession from Peter and without proof 
    for the primacy of the Roman church, the Catholic church cannot support its 
    maternal view of the scriptures. Consequently, most of the unique Catholic 
    doctrines (temporal punishment, penance, the veneration of Mary and the saints, 
    the mass, etc.) would also not be able to stand.</sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">It is important, therefore, that the serious student 
    of Catholic doctrine become very familiar with the patristic writings themselves. 
    Attempting to dialog with the Catholic pillars of doctrine from a standard 
    non-Catholic Bible is insufficient. To be sure, an understanding of the history 
    of the New Testament and of the scriptures cited by the Catholic church is 
    necessary.</sub> </font></li>
</ol>
<h3><font size="+1">B. Questions for Reflection</sub></font></h3>
<ol>
  <li><font size="+1">What is the difference, if any, between the Catholic 
    church's Seven Sacraments and the so-called <a href="../classes/papers/mogcht.htm">Means 
    of Growth</a>?</sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">What is the difference between the Catholic view of 
    &quot;confession&quot; and your view of confessing sins to one another?</sub> 
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">If you think Catholic doctrine is &quot;unbiblical,&quot; 
    why are there over 60 million in the U.S. alone?</sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">What, if anything, is wrong with the Catholic view 
    of Mt. 16:18-19? What was Christ granting to Peter? What bearing does that 
    have on today?</sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Are there areas in the non-essential theology or methodology 
    of your church that are vulnerable to unbiblical veneration?</sub> </font></li>
</ol>
<h3><font size="+1">C. Caution</sub></font></h3>
<ol>
  <li><font size="+1">It would be wise to remember that the &quot;average&quot; 
    Catholic is hardly aware of any of the foundational development of their doctrine. 
    They are often even less aware of the more scandalous events found in the 
    history of the Catholic church. This is because the focus of their faith revolves 
    around the activity of their particular local church.</sub> </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">The material presented in this study is designed to 
    provide a better understanding of the Catholic church. The direction of any 
    particular dialog between Protestant and catholic must be decided individually.</sub></font>

<h3>by Jim Leffe<b>l</b></h3>

<hr>

<p>Not long ago, I saw the movie &quot;At Play in the Fields of the Lord.&quot; Shot on
site in the Amazon rain forest, it's a film with a familiar theme: Christian missionaries
destroying the pristine innocence of primal cultures. The defining scene of the movie is
an exchange between a zealous, if naive young missionary and a cynical, displaced Native
Amazonian. The latter confronts the missionary, saying, &quot;If the Lord made Indians the
way they are, who are you people to make them different?&quot;</p>

<p>You don't have to go to the Brazilian jungle to get this message. It is also the ethic
at most secular universities. Attempting to convert someone is considered intolerant and
arrogant, because it implies standing in judgment over their unique experience and
culture. Christianity is not a live option for a growing majority of the emerging
generation, but for reasons that are rather unique to our day. It's not that Christianity
has been refuted by scientific fact or historical scrutiny. Rather, it's considered
implausible because it claims to be universally and objectively true--that is, true for
everybody. Put simply, the Christian message violates today's carefully cultivated
incredulity toward all absolutes, especially religious ones.</p>

<p>Christian <i>exclusivism</i>, the position that Christianity is the final word on
matters of ultimate truth, is not &quot;politically correct.&quot; Sometimes professing
faith in Christ in higher education is tantamount to admitting that you're a racist or
sexist. Most of the time though it's met with the mantra-like refrain, &quot;I'm glad
you've found something that works for you, but don't impose your beliefs on me.&quot;</p>

<p>I suggest that the primary barrier to getting a hearing for the gospel on the vast
majority of campuses today is ideologically driven <i>pluralism</i>. Pluralism takes the
fact of the world's rich cultural diversity and makes an &quot;ism&quot; out of it. It
doesn't merely extol the virtue of understanding and appreciating cultural differences;
virtually everyone is for that. Pluralism holds that distinct cultural beliefs are true
for that culture--but not for cultures that operate out of a different
&quot;paradigm.&quot; Pluralists say that truth is a &quot;social construction.&quot; It
is <i>created</i> through social consensus and tradition, not discovered in reality that
exists independently of our beliefs. Truth is subjective interpretation, not
correspondence between our beliefs and reality.</p>

<p>Since pluralists consider truth to be a cultural construct, it is the height of
arrogance to try to convert someone from their paradigm (especially if it's non-western)
to Christianity. That's what most people mean when they say that Christianity is
intolerant. But should we accept the pluralistic definition of &quot;tolerance&quot;?</p>

<p>Social intolerance used to mean attacking someone or discriminating against them
because of who they are or what they believe. Biblically minded Christians should oppose
this form of intolerance because it is bigotry and prejudice. We must also accept the fact
that Christians have acted intolerantly in this sense. Indeed, the name of Christ has been
attached to some of history's greatest outrages. While Christians have often been at the
forefront of social reform, we must come to terms with a legacy of hypocrisy in areas like
slavery, savagery toward Native Americans and other human rights abuses.</p>

<p>Having made these observations, it must be emphasized that such hypocrisy is
unbiblical. That is, while Christians have treated vulnerable peoples unjustly, biblical
Christianity itself is not intolerant. The Bible gives us a genuine basis to recognize
hypocrisy and confront it for what it is. Because the Bible upholds the dignity of all
persons as image-bearers of God, we have a basis for a genuinely diverse culture. When
faithful to the scripture, Christianity is tolerant in the appropriate sense of the term.</p>

<p>But as many define tolerance today, Christianity <i>is</i> intolerant. When tolerance
means that we are to accept all beliefs as equally true and valid, Christians must
respectfully object. The notion that truth is a social construct is both unbiblical and
dangerous. Truth matters. It's no mere philosophical abstraction. Jesus said, &quot;You
shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.&quot; Our commission is to spread
the good news to all the peoples of the earth. To make effective inroads in today's
multi-ethnic, culturally diverse university, we must do the hard work of engaging the
thinking behind pluralism and the demands of this new meaning of tolerance.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Understanding postmodern pluralism </h3>

<p>The pluralistic view of tolerance is rooted in a broader intellectual and cultural
movement called <i>postmodernism</i>. For postmodern thinkers, who now dominate the arts,
humanities and social sciences of many universities, everything is a social construct. All
claims to truth are rooted in cultural bias, so there is no objective truth. Ethical
values are the product of unique cultural traditions, so there are no moral absolutes.
Human personhood is the product of socialization, so there is no universal human essence.</p>

<p>These assumptions have enormous implications. Postmodern psychologist and social critic
Kenneth Gergen notes in his book <i>The Saturated Self</i>, 

<ol>
  <li>With the spread of postmodern consciousness, we see the demise of personal definition,
    reason, authority. . . All intrinsic properties of the human being, along with moral worth
    and personal commitment, are lost from view. . .<a href="#Endnote1">[endnote
    1]</a><a name="end1"> </a></li>
</ol>

<p>The self stands under &quot;erasure&quot; for postmodern pluralists, meaning the denial
of all transcendent categories, including human personhood. This raises not only important
questions about human rights, but directly relates to the question of objective truth and
reason. Though not a postmodernist, Peter Berger's work in the sociology of knowledge
provides the basis for postmodern &quot;constructivism&quot; and its implications. Berger
writes, 

<ol>
  <li>A thought of any kind is grounded in society. . .The individual, then, derives his
    worldview socially in very much the same way that he derives his roles and his identity.
    In other words, his emotions and his self-interpretation like his actions are predefined
    for him by society, and so is his cognitive approach to the universe that surrounds him.<a href="#Endnote2">[endnote 2]</a><a name="end2"> </a></li>
</ol>

<p>Berger's observation, true in part, is driven to a radical conclusion by
postmodernists. They reject the possibility of discovering objective truth all together,
since each culture approaches reality differently, depending on its particular needs and
historical conditions. To claim knowledge of objective truth presumes the possibility of
transcending the social construction of knowledge, which is, on postmodern pluralistic
assumptions, impossible.</p>

<p>In the place of objective truth and what postmodernists call &quot;metanarratives&quot;
(comprehensive world views), we find &quot;local narratives,&quot; or stories about
reality that &quot;work&quot; for particular communities--but have no validity beyond that
community. Indeed, postmodernists reject the whole language of truth and reality in favor
of literary terms like <i>narrative</i> and <i>story</i>. It's all about interpretation,
not about what's real or true.</p>

<p>Postmodern pluralists hold that the pretense of objective truth always does violence by
excluding other voices (regarding other world views to be invalid), and marginalizing the
vulnerable by scripting them out of the story. Truth claims, we are told, are merely tools
to legitimate power. Michel Foucault writes, &quot;We cannot exercise power except through
the production of truth.&quot;<a href="#Endnote3">[endnote 3]</a><a name="end3"> </a>For postmodernists, truth claims reduce to mere propaganda, the
pernicious &quot;will to power.&quot; That's why with postmodern pluralism, the person to
be feared is the one who believes that we can actually discover ultimate truth. The <i>dogmatist</i>,
the <i>totalizer</i>, the <i>absolutist</i> is both naive and dangerous.</p>

<p>Consequently, rather than dominating others with our &quot;version of reality,&quot; we
should accept all beliefs as equally valid. Openness without the restraint of reason, and
tolerance without moral appraisal are the new pluralistic mandates. That's what makes
evangelism so unfashionable on campuses today.</p>

<p>Ironically, in an age of anti-dogmatism, postmodern radical subjectivity leads to the
dangerous inference that no one can ever be <i>wrong</i> about what they believe. If we
are free from the constraints of rationality, nothing separates truth from self-delusion.
Gergen's words are both candid and chilling: 

<ol>
  <li>. . . evaluation can only take place from within a perspective. To favor one of these
    perspectives because it is 'objectively true' presupposes that I have a perspective in
    which 'objectively true' is an intelligible criterion of evaluation. If in my view
    'objective truth' is a misleading term, I can scarcely condemn a theory because it is
    objectively false.<a href="#Endnote4">[endnote 4]</a><a name="end4"> </a></li>
</ol>

<p>Postmodern anti-dogmatism ends up being anti-intellectual. If we can't reject a theory
because it is objectively false, then the pursuit of truth is meaningless. This explains
why truth has been replaced, especially among many academics, for politically empowering
narrative. This kind of thinking is often found in revisionist history, feminist critical
method, and many pluralistic formulations of multiculturalism.</p>

<p>Christians need to be respectful of what others believe and of the traditions and
experiences that form those beliefs. Scripture upholds the value of cultural diversity by
tells us to &quot;respect what is right in the sight of all people&quot; (Romans 14) and
&quot;be all things to all people&quot; (1 Corinthians 9). But the postmodern demand to
uncritically accept all beliefs as true (at least for the person who believes them) is
fanatical. </p>

<p>Beliefs formed in the pluralistic climate of openness and tolerance create a firewall
against genuine and substantive dialogue about spiritual truth and human rights. For
example, &quot;political correctness&quot; advocates like Stanley Fish have argued that
since all speech is a political power-play, ideas must be monitored and managed, not
rationally and constructively engaged.<a href="#Endnote5">[endnote 5]</a><a name="end5"> </a>This has given rise to the accusation, even among liberal academics like
Harvard's Alan Dershowitz, that a new McCarthyism pervades intellectual life today.<a href="#Endnote6">[endnote 6]</a> <a name="end6"></a> History offers sobering
testimony to the high price such anti-rational dogmatism exacts. </p>

<p>Contrary to the inviting rhetoric of openness and inclusion, postmodern pluralism
threatens those who are marginalized the most. If truth is really a political power-play,
the dominant culture is probably going to be the winner. And if human nature is a mere
cultural construct, the rights of those who don't fit the arbitrary &quot;norm&quot; are
at risk. As our culture continues down the path of fragmentation and alienation,
Christians who make an informed and compelling case for the gospel and intrinsic human
dignity have a powerful message for a pluralistic age. </p>

<hr>

<h3>The pluralist objection to Christian exclusivism</h3>

<p>Dispite the clear and intractable problems with postmodern pluralism, it remains a
powerful force both in academics and in popular culture. But nowhere is this more evident
than in religion. Religious pluralism is an emerging, measurable consensus of our
postmodern age.<a href="#Endnote7">[endnote 7]</a><a name="end7"></a> Oddly
enough, some of the most ardent defenders of religious pluralism and virulent critics of
Christian exclusivism are theologians and philosophers who profess faith in Christ.
Distinguished philosopher of religion John Hick concludes, 

<ol>
  <li>I believe that anyone who is either born or &quot;born again&quot; into the
    conservative-evangelical thought world, and who has a questioning mind, will find that he
    has to face challenges to the belief system within which his Christian faith was first
    made available to him, and that he will almost certainly be led by rational or moral
    considerations to modify or discard many of its elements.<a href="#Endnote8">[endnote
    8]</a><a name="end8"></a></li>
</ol>

<p>So what are the &quot;rational and moral considerations&quot; for giving up
exclusivism?<i> </i>Reflecting on the diversity of the world's religions, Hick says, 

<ol>
  <li>[I]n the light of our accumulated knowledge of the other great world faiths [Christian
    exclusivism] has become unacceptable to all except a minority of dogmatic diehards. For it
    conflicts with our concept of God, which we have received from Jesus, as the loving
    heavenly Father of all mankind; could such a Being have restricted the possibility of
    salvation to those who happen to have been born in certain countries in certain periods of
    history?<a href="#Endnote9">[endnote 9]</a><a name="end9"></a></li>
</ol>

<p>Hick rightly points out that religious intolerance is usually born out of ignorance.
Once we become aware of the rich traditions that form the world's religions, it is much
more complicated to maintain the exclusivist view. But for Hick, Christian exclusivism is
untenable because it violates the moral character of God. He wonders how an all loving God
could condemn the vast majority to eternal hell simply because they happen to have been
born in the wrong place or at the wrong time? And isn't it arrogant to think that sincere
and well intentioned people will be damned just because they happen to have encountered
and accepted a different religion? Hick thinks that only the salvation of all humanity
through various religious traditions is morally acceptable and rationally compelling. This
facet of pluralism is called <i>universalism.</i></p>

<p>Unfortunately, Hick and other pluralists don't accurately represent Christian
exclusivism. The Bible doesn't teach that God's judgment is based on where or when a
person is born. Also, religious sincerity is certainly no measure of truth. Yet Hick
raises a troubling point. I really can't think of anything that bothers me more than the
doctrine of judgment. I don't like thinking about the possibility that people I love and
respect might be eternally separated from God. I'm troubled by Jesus' observation that
&quot;narrow is the path that leads to salvation.&quot; Christians will make few inroads
into our pluralistic culture without providing a sensitive and coherent response to this
rhetorically powerful and emotionally charged objection. To that end, I encourage you to
read the excellent texts on this subject listed in the endnotes.<a href="#Endnote10">[endnote 10]</a><a name="end10"></a> </p>

<p>For the purposes of this essay, I'd like to make a couple of observations about Hick's
alternative to Christian exclusivism. Does pluralistic universalism avoid the moral and
rational problems Hick and others see in Christian exclusivism?</p>

<p>Hick supposes that if God is truly loving, he will be revealed in all the great
religious traditions of the world. But let's note that accepting religious pluralism does
not entail universalism. On the contrary, all of the monotheistic religions Hick believes
to be valid teach divine judgment. And the eastern religions--Hinduism and Buddhism in
particular--certainly don't teach universal salvation or <i>moksha</i> (release from the
cycle of life). So simply asserting that all religions are legitimate paths to God, as
pluralists do, doesn't result in universal salvation. Indeed, it seems that if
universalism is true, then it really doesn't matter what a person believes or what they do
with their life. Universalism actually has nothing to do with the pluralistic view of
religion. Consequently, pluralism does not overcome Hick's moral objection to Christian
exclusivism.</p>

<p>More importantly, universalism trivializes the meaning of divine love. This is so
because if there is no ultimate accountability for our lives, no judgment, then the
choices we make in life are of no final consequence. Without judgment, there is no way to
distinguish between heaven and hell. After all, how would you characterize eternity with
an unrepentant Hitler? In what sense could this be heaven? Further, how would six million
Jews think about the love of God if it didn't make any ultimate difference to him what
Hitler and the Nazis did? Universalism does not uniquely allow for the love of God as
pluralists suppose. It makes God indifferent to cruelty and trivializes the significance
of human freedom by dislodging choices from their consequences. Any meaningful definition
of God's love must also affirm his justice. Once we grasp the necessity of justice in
divine love, the uniqueness of the Christian message strikes a powerful chord. By God's
grace, he has poured out his judgment on Christ so that we who deserve judgment may
receive eternal life.</p>

<p>The moral objection to Christian exclusivism based on God's judgment is simply not
compelling. But what about the religious pluralists' claim that it's arrogant and naive to
say that Christianity alone is true? Is pluralism a more reasonable position as Hick
purports?</p>

<p>Hick follows several lines of argument in support of religious pluralism. Here we
consider the two that most influence popular pluralistic views.</p>

<p>First, Hick says that the universe is &quot;religiously neutral.&quot; By this he means
that none of the arguments for any particular world view are uniquely compelling. Even
trying to say which arguments are the most plausible is out, since knowledge of the
universe is so limited. A range of alternatives that include atheism and all the great
world religions must be kept open. 

<ol>
  <li>It seems, then, that the universe maintains its inscrutable ambiguity. In some aspects
    it invites whilst in other it repels a religious response. It permits both a religious and
    a naturalistic faith, but haunted in each case by a contrary possibility that can never be
    exorcised. Any realistic analysis of religious belief and experience, and any realistic
    defense of the rationality of religious conviction, must therefore start from this
    situation of <i>systematic ambiguity.</i><a href="#Endnote11">[endnote 11]</a><a name="end11"></a> </li>
</ol>

<p>To the extent that it is possible to be objective, the universe fails to come to the
aid of any particular world view. That's what Hick means by <i>systematic ambiguity</i>. </p>

<p>On the one hand, Hick's position makes good sense. When theology is naively wed to
prevailing scientific theories, it can lead to the corruption of both religion and
science. This is the lesson of the medieval marriage of Ptolemaic astronomy and Catholic
doctrine. Theology suppressed the growth of scientific inquiry, and the Copernican
revolution created the unnecessary conflict between science and religion. </p>

<p>On the other hand, to say that the data of science and history is of no value in
discerning religious truth goes too far. That the universe is finite, for example, is a
well established fact. This is consistent with the Bible, but inconsistent with eastern
religious teaching and suggests that the world is not, in Hick's words, &quot;religiously
neutral.&quot; The data of science lends plausibility to some religious doctrines, while
falsifying others. Similarly, were factual statements made in the Bible shown to be
historically false, this would count as positive evidence against Christianity. Clearly,
science and history have implications for religious truth claims. Religious propositions
are subject to falsification just as any other truth claim.</p>

<p>Second, pluralists think of religious truth as human experience within a cultural
paradigm. Hick isn't interested in the data of science or history, since they maintain
their &quot;inscrutable ambiguity&quot; on matters of ultimate reality. He adopts an
essentially constructivist view of truth. Following the philosopher Immanuel Kant, Hick
says that we must distinguish between reality <i>as it is</i> (noumena) and reality <i>as
we perceive it</i> (phenomena). The idea is that we don't have direct access to reality as
it is in itself. We think through &quot;interpretative filters&quot; that shape our
perceptions of reality. For example, we see colors and hear sounds because that's the way
our perceptual organs are set up to interpret light and sound waves. We have no way of
knowing what, if any, color the world actually is since we can't escape perceiving the
world the way we do. Reality as it is <i>in itself</i> is beyond our grasp. We can be sure
of our <i>ideas</i> of reality, but not of their correspondence to the world as it
actually is. Philosophers have called this the <i>egocentric dilemma</i>.</p>

<p>Hick applies this noumena/phenomena distinction to religion. Since human perception,
governed by cultural conditioning, shapes our religious beliefs, Hick concludes that God,
or the <i>Real</i> in itself, is beyond all human concepts.<a href="#Endnote12">[endnote 12]</a><a name="end12"></a> Some religions conceive
God as personal, others as impersonal. Some view God as transcendent, others as imminent.
But once we recognize the basic distinction between reality as perceived and reality in
itself, all of these differences based in human perception loose their significance. Hick
states, 

<ol>
  <li>The distinction between the Real as it is in itself and as it is thought and experienced
    through our human religious concepts entails. . .that we cannot apply to the Real in
    itself the characteristics encountered in its [religious representations]. Thus it cannot
    be said to be one or many, person or thing, conscious or unconscious, purposive or
    non-purposive, substance or process, good or evil, loving or hating. None of the
    descriptive terms that apply within the realm of human experience can apply literally to
    the unexperiencable reality that underlies that realm.<a href="#Endnote13">[endnote
    13]</a><a name="end13"></a></li>
</ol>

<p>On this view, no religion truly reflects the Real in itself. That's what is thought to
follow from the noumena/phenomena distinction. Yet, Hick makes it clear that the major
world religions are valid within their cultural context. 

<ol>
  <li>[Yahweh] is, according to my hypothesis, the divine persona in relation to the Jewish
    people. And as such he represents a genuine, authentic, valid human perception of the
    Eternal One from within a particular human culture and strand of history. But he is a
    different divine persona from, say, Shiva or from Krishna, who are divine personae in
    relation respectively to the Shaivite and the Vaishnavite communities of India.<a href="#Endnote14">[endnote 14]</a><a name="end14"></a></li>
</ol>

<p>Notice the dilemma in Hick's proposal. He wants to say that all major religions are
&quot;genuine, authentic, valid human perceptions,&quot; and at the same time, &quot;[the
Real] cannot be said to be one or many, conscious or unconscious, purposive or
non-purposive, substance or process, good or evil, loving or hating.&quot; In other words,
it's valid for Christians to believe that God is &quot;good, purposive and
conscious,&quot; yet those beliefs aren't actually true about God as he actually exists.
Our experience of God is somehow valid even though it doesn't correspond to the the way
God is.</p>

<p>This creates a strange tension within the pluralists' position. Either the major world
religions are authentic, valid manifestations of the Real, or they are not. If they are
valid, then the Real must be both personal and impersonal, purposive and non-purposive and
so on. But this impossible, for it can not be the case that the Real possesses a
contradictory nature. It violates the <i>law of identity</i>. In affirming two mutually
exclusive things about God, the pluralistic view ends up being rationally incoherent. God
could be personal <i>or</i> impersonal, but not <i>both</i> personal and impersonal. But
if God is either personal or impersonal, then the pluralistic hypothesis fails because
various religions disagree on this very important point.</p>

<p>In reality, Hick is not committed to the pluralistic hypothesis that each religion is
true in its own way. He is actually advocating agnosticism--the idea that no one can know
God or say anything true about him (her or it). Indeed, Hick seems to be disguising a
rather well-trod agnosticism in the inviting rhetoric of religious pluralism.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Coming to terms with pluralistic tolerance</h3>

<p>What does this analysis of pluralism mean for the Christian witness to secular culture?
Here are a few principles to apply.</p>

<p>First, Most people's thoughts about the world's religions are shaped more by their
cultural and political legacy than the propositional or doctrinal content. With this in
mind, Christians should not try to defend the indefensible. The only association many
primal cultures have with Christianity has been when it has been used as a tool of
exploitation and domination. Even when that has not been the personal experience of
non-Christians on campus, it's usually the main thing they are taught about Christianity.
Western imperialism and Christianity, they learn, go hand in hand. We should lament and
decry this legacy of injustice just as loudly as anyone else. But just as emphatically, we
should demonstrate that the cynical use of religion to justify economic and political
ambition is anti-Christian. We need to distinguish between what the Christian message is
and how it has been abused. There are also important examples of the biblical foundation
for many important civil rights movements such as the abolition of slavery and child
labor.</p>

<p>Second, the rise of pluralism requires us to be more sensitive to the role culture
plays in personal identity and forming spiritual beliefs. Becoming a Christian is not the
same thing as living and thinking like the conservative white middle class. Yet, that's
the image most non-Christians have in their minds-- which is why Christ is not a live
option for many of them. </p>

<p>We must be careful to minimize the intrusion of non-essential cultural baggage into our
Christian witness. That means looking for opportunities to meet people in places where
they are comfortable even if we aren't. Subverting the expectations non-Christians have of
Christians is an increasingly important part of being effective ambassadors for Christ
today. We must be willing to move as far toward the culture as we need to, so long as it
does not involve compromising biblical morality or truth. In short, it means adopting
principles of cross-cultural missions in domestic evangelism. </p>

<p>Third, we must be aware of the fact that the vast majority of people have
  been well indoctrinated into the pluralistic tolerance ethic. To &quot;give
  an account of the hope that is within us&quot; as scripture commands, we should
  be familiar with pluralistic arguments like the ones considered in this paper.
  By carefully and sensitively stripping away the attractive veneer of postmodern
  pluralism, exposing it for what it is, we can eliminate a key barrier to communicating
  the gospel. One thing stands out in my mind
  more than anything else as I reflect on the Christian witness in our day: we
  must be far more sophisticated in our thinking and flexible in our methods
  than perhaps ever before.</p>

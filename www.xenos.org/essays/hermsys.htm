<h2>By <a href="../personal/den.htm">Dennis McCallum</a> and <a href="../personal/gary.htm">Gary DeLashmutt</a></h2>
<h3>I. The Allegorical Method</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
  <b>History</b> - This method was used by many 2nd &amp; 3rd century church fathers. It was
    established as the preferred method of interpretation by Augustine and was dominant in
    Catholicism throughout the Middle Ages. It is also used by amillenialists in interpreting
    unfulfilled prophecy. </li><li>
  <b>Definition</b> - The literal meaning of the text is either, not the true meaning, or
    only one of many meanings. The elements of each passage have a corresponding spiritual
    reality which is the &quot;real&quot; or ultimate meaning of the passage. <ul>
      <li>Origen interpreted Noah's Ark to have 3 meanings (literal, moral, and spiritual) to
        correspond to man's body, soul and spirit: salvation from the Flood, salvation of the
        believer from a specific sin and salvation of the church through Christ. </li>
      <li>Popes used this method to uphold papal supremacy. Innocent III taught that the two great
        lights in Gen. 1 refer to the order of authority on earth. Thus, the sun symbolized
        spiritual authority (i.e., the pope) and the moon symbolized civil authority (the
        emperor). Boniface VIII referring to Luke 22:38, taught that the two swords held by the
        disciples meant that the apostles were authoritative in both the secular and spiritual
        kingdoms. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why This Method Is Unacceptable <ul>
      <li>Since there is no objective standard to which the interpreter must bow, the final
        authority ceases to be the scripture and becomes the interpreter. Whose allegorical
        symbols are right? This question leads to the establishment of a church hierarchical
        authority which effectively replaces Scripture as the true locus of authority. </li>
      <li>Allegorical interpretation is only rarely seen in scripture (Gal. 4:21-31; I Cor.
        10:1-4). Parables are usually not allegories. When would allegorical interpretation be
        allowable? </li>
      <li>An even more extreme example of this kind of over-interpretation is numerology. In
        numerology, numbers in the Bible (whether actual numbers, or the number of letters in
        names and passages) are seen to hold secret symbolic messages. There is no warrant in the
        Bible for this kind of interpretation. It should be avoided at all times. </li>
      <li>Interpreters distinguish between types and allegories. Types are restricted in several
        ways that allegories are not. See &quot;Elements of Biblical Typology&quot; by the present
        authors for a description of types. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>II. The Literalistic Method</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
  <b>History</b> - This method was used by the Jews after the Babylonian Exile. It is also
    used by extreme fundamentalists and many cults (Children of God, Jehovah's Witnesses,
    Mormons, etc.). </li><li>
  <b>Definition</b> - Every word is taken absolutely literally including figures of speech
    and symbolism. Historical background is considered unnecessary and ignored. Any deviation
    from this rule is regarded as sacrilegious. <ul>
      <li>Mormonism teaches that God has a body because of references to God's &quot;eye,&quot;
        &quot;hand,&quot; etc. However, see Ps. 91:1-4. Does this mean He also has feathers and
        wings? </li>
      <li>Roman Catholic interpretation of Lk. 22:19 leads to the doctrine of transubstantiation.
        However, does this also mean that Christ is a door (Jn. 7)? </li>
      <li>Jehovah's Witnesses use Col. 1:15 to prove that Christ was a created being. But
        &quot;first- born&quot; was also used to refer to the inheritor of the family estate (Num.
        21:15-17). </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why This Method Is Unacceptable <ul>
      <li>Subscribers always use it selectively (see the above examples). </li>
      <li>It makes scripture unintelligible, contradictory, and unlivable (i.e., Lk. 14:26). </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>III. The Naturalistic Method</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
  <b>History</b> - This system arose during the Enlightenment (18th century). It is used by
    old-line liberal theology as their basic hermeneutic. </li><li>
  <b>Definition</b> - The naturalistic world-view (i.e. the universe is a closed system of
    cause and effect) is the standard by which scripture must be interpreted. Scripture
    becomes intelligible only as ancient man's attempt to explain nature. It also assumes that
    religion has evolved through several stages which can be used to date the material in the
    Bible. <ul>
      <li>Miracles are rejected as primitive explanations or myths. </li>
      <li>The goal is to rediscover the &quot;true record&quot; (i.e., the &quot;historical&quot;
        Jesus, or the &quot;strata&quot; in the Pentateuch) within the legendary accounts of the
        Bible. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why This Method Is Unacceptable <ul>
      <li>It makes an unproved world-view the final authority. </li>
      <li>The attempt to separate the historical from the &quot;legendary&quot; has been proven to
        be impossible. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>IV. Neo-Orthodox Interpretation</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
  <b>History</b> - Neo Orthodox theology arose after World War I which shattered the optimism
    of liberal theologians. Its founders, Friedrich Schleiermacher and Karl Barth, began a
    movement which dominates both Catholic and Protestant theology today. </li><li>
  <b>Definition</b> - Neo-orthodoxy takes an approach to theology that places the religious
    experience of the interpreter in the center. The Bible is important for stimulating such
    an experience. When it does so, it &quot;becomes the word of God&quot; for that reader, at
    that time. Neo- orthodox theologians are generally willing to accept the conclusions of
    the naturalistic theologians regarding errors in the Bible, but feel that these do not
    affect the reader's ability to encounter God through it. <ul>
      <li>Through seeing the wonder and rapture of the disciples as they behold the
        &quot;miracles&quot; of Christ, we can enter into the same sense of rapture. Thus, as we
        see the amazement of the disciples when they behold the resurrected Christ, we too are
        amazed to find that He has risen in our hearts. Of course, whether Christ actually did
        rise from the dead is not important. Thus the Neo-orthodox theologian can declare,
        &quot;He is risen!&quot; </li>
      <li>Neo orthodox theologians routinely refer to miraculous events as though they were
        history, when they actually believe that the experience of the authors rather than the
        events themselves that are historical. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why This Method Is Unacceptable <ul>
      <li>The separation of &quot;truth&quot; or &quot;encounter with Jesus&quot; from the factual
        content of scripture lowers the Bible to the same level as any other book about religion. </li>
      <li>Unless Christ was physically raised from the dead, our experience of his
        &quot;resurrection&quot; is superfluous (I Cor. 15:12-19). </li>
      <li>The criticisms of the naturalistic school also apply. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>V. Devotional Interpretation</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
  <b>History</b> - This method grew out of the post-Reformation as a reaction against sterile
    creedalism. This is the system unconsciously used by most Christians today. </li><li>
  <b>Definition</b> - The devotional method focuses almost exclusively on what is personally
    applicable and edifying. It tends to ignore context, historical background, and other
    important interpretive principles. <ul>
      <li>Watchman Nee uses Mk. 14:3, Jn. 12:3, Jn. 3:30 &amp; Mk. 8:6 to support the necessity of
        &quot;brokenness&quot; in the Christian life. </li>
      <li>Extremists use Col. 3:15 to support being led by the Holy Spirit on the basis of
        feelings. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why This Method Is Unacceptable <ul>
      <li>Devotional interpretation can easily lead to uncontrolled allegorizing and inaccurate
        interpretation through eisogesis. </li>
      <li>While the goals of this approach to Scripture are commendable, a critical analysis of
        the text has to precede the devotional question. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>VI. Ideological Interpretation</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>History</b> - The &quot;New Criticism&quot; advanced in the 1940's began 
    to focus on text and reader rather than on the author. The author has no more 
    authority over the meaning of the text than anyone else because: 1) He didn't 
    realize his own bias at the time he wrote, and 2) We have no way to read his 
    mind and thus know his intentions. </li>
  <li><b>Definition</b> - Ideological interpreters approach the Bible looking 
    for material relevant to their ideology. They usually are open about the fact 
    that they have an agenda, and usually claim they are correcting oversights 
    from earlier years by focusing on their area of interest. Most ideological 
    readers also entertain a reader-centered hermeneutic. They are skeptical about 
    ever knowing what the author intended to say, and focus instead on how the 
    text affects the modern reader. 
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Feminist Theology </b>- seeks to study women in the Bible, and to 
        demonstrate that the more enlightened speakers in Scripture were anti-patriarchy. 
        In general, their studies are intended to explode the myth of patriarchy 
        and to uncover cruelty to women. Some advance gender-neutral language 
        in translation, including God as &quot;she,&quot; sometimes based on lady 
        wisdom Prov. 1:20ff. </li>
      <li> <b>Marxist or Liberation Theology </b>- seeks to show that the true 
        intent of God in the Bible is to teach that poor and oppressed classes 
        should be liberated from their oppression by the love of God. Tends to 
        interpret redemptive language in terms of economics and political power. 
        They see class struggle in much of the conflict in the Bible. </li>
      <li> <b>Deconstruction</b> - Postmodern readers see the Bible, not as teaching 
        liberation, but as a tool used for exploitation. The Bible is propaganda 
        intended to show why patriarchy is appropriate. The authors of Scripture 
        sought to legitimize the status quo of society by teaching people to obey 
        their authorities. They also sought to justify aggrandizement of the state 
        of Israel and the subjugation of neighboring peoples. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why This Method Is Unacceptable 
    <ul>
      <li>Most systems seek to decrease reader bias through the application of 
        rules. These rules introduce objectivity to the interpretive process, 
        according to traditional methods. Ideological and reader-centered methods 
        hold that objectivity is never possible, because the text was never objective 
        in the first place. The first act of interpretation was the author's decision 
        about what to include and what to exclude in his text. Also, the uncertainty 
        of language means modern readers might as well supply their own interpretation, 
        because we will never know what the &quot;true&quot; interpretation should 
        be. To hold to such a thing as a &quot;true&quot; or &quot;real&quot; 
        interpretation is naive, because such faith fails to take into account 
        the arbitrary nature of language and the social forces which distort people's 
        (both readers and author's) view of the world. </li>
      <li>Consequently, reader-centered theories are openly biased, but they hold 
        that in this they are no different than other approaches except that they

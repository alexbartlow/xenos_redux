<h1>The Waldensian Movement From Waldo to the Reformation III </h1>

<h5>By <a href="../personal/den.htm">Dennis McCallum</a></h5>

<hr>

<h3>A Time of Religious Agitation and Revolution</h3>

<p>Waldo was neither the first nor the only divergent voice raised inside and outside of
the Roman Catholic Church at this time and place. Europe was aflame with new religious
movements reacting to such things as the struggle of the Papacy for supremacy, the corrupt
practices of local clergy, and the currents of thought that were flowing into the area as
a result of the Crusades.22 The Albigensians or the Cathari were the leading schismatic
group,23 but there were many other attacks as well. In 1140 the bishops of France wrote to
the Pope that, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everywhere in our cities and villages, not only in our schools but at the street
  corners, learned and ignorant, great and small, are discussing the gravest mysteries.24 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the history of this period we find reference to numerous heretical groups, 

<ol>
  <li>In 1259 the <i><b>Flagellants </b></i>appeared. By a kind of mass contagion men, women,
    and children bewailed their sins and many of them marched through the streets, naked
    except for loin cloths, crying to God for mercy, and scourging themselves until the blood
    ran.25 &quot;They proclaimed complete certainty of salvation to all who should persevere
    in flagellation for thirty-three days. Scourging was the one necessary sacrament. They
    were condemned in 1349.&quot;26 </li>
  <li>The <i><b>Beguines </b></i>comprised a variety of lay groups which seem not to have been
    confined to any specific set of forms and to have displayed wide variety. Deansly says
    they were, &quot;the followers of Lambert le Begue, (the Stammerer). . . devout but
    unlettered lay people, who set great store on the use of vernacular scriptures. Lambert's
    followers were called from his surname, in Dutch, Beghards, (whence the English word
    &quot;beggar&quot;) in Latin Beguini or Beguinae.&quot; She claims that the early
    Waldensians joined forces with groups of Beguinae.27 </li>
  <li><i><b>Tanchelm </b></i>began to preach in the diocese of Utrecht and early in the
    twelfth century his views had fairly wide currency in the Low Countries and the Rhine
    Valley. He attacked the entire structure of the Catholic Church, denied the authority of
    the Church and of the Pope, and held that at least some of the sacraments were valueless. </li>
  <li>Early in the twelfth century, <i><b>Peter of Bruys</b></i>, himself following a strictly
    ascetic way of life, rejected the baptism of infants, the Eucharist, church buildings,
    ecclesiastical ceremonies, prayers for the dead, and the veneration of the cross. The <i><b>Petrobrusians</b></i>
    re-baptized those who joined them, profaned churches, burned crosses, and overthrew
    altars. </li>
  <li>Sometimes classed with Peter of Bruys, but perhaps mistakenly, was <i><b>Henry of
    Lausanne</b></i>. Like the former he preached in what is now France and in the first half
    of the twelfth century. Before his death in 1145 he is said to have attracted a wide
    following, called <i><b>Henricians</b></i>. He taught that the sacraments were valid only
    when administered by priests who led a life of asceticism and poverty. He condemned the
    clergy of the day for their love of wealth and power.28 </li>
  <li>The <i><b>Adamists </b></i>conducted their worship in the nude.29 </li>
  <li><i><b>Arnold of Brescia</b></i>. . .was earnestly eager to see the Church conform fully
    to the Christian ideal. Believing that this could not be so long as its leaders
    compromised with the world, he attacked the bishops for their cupidity, dishonest gains,
    and frequent irregularity of life and urged that the clergy renounce all property and
    political and physical power. . .in 1155 he was hanged, his body was burned, and his ashes
    were thrown into the Tiber. . . .30 </li>
  <li>In Northern Italy, &quot;. . .the &quot;<i><b>Pataria</b></i>&quot; had some years
    earlier grown up spontaneously in reaction to an increasing corrupt and politically
    oriented clergy.&quot; They were apparently the descendants of the <i><b>Bogomils</b></i>,
    who in turn grew out of the dualistic &quot;<i><b>Paulicians</b></i>&quot;.31 </li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to these were numerous lesser movements, of which Latourette admits,
&quot;We shall probably never learn even the names of all of them.&quot;32 </p>

<p>Even this short list demonstrates that there were questions being asked at this time,
many of which are strikingly similar to those issues raised by the Poor of Lyons: 

<ul>
  <li>the question of poverty and asceticism as a means of growth and/or salvation, </li>
  <li>questions about the role of ritual, </li>
  <li>activism of various sorts among the laity, </li>
  <li>questions about the integrity of the clergy. </li>
  <li>questions about interpretation and application of the Bible.33 </li>
</ul>

<p>It is likely that Waldo and his followers were influenced by some of these movements,
although it is not clear how much. It would be too coincidental to see such common themes
arising apart from any influence whatever. The fact is that there was a cultural and
religious milieu shaping the thinking of this movement. </p>

<p>For example, we can place Lyonese poor nuclei in the same area of France as the <i>Cathari</i>,
at a time when the Catharite revolution was at its height.34 Also, both southern France
and northern Italy were hot-beds of dissident zeal during the very period of the rise of
the Waldensians. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the Neo-Platonic and dualistic aspects of so many of these groups is
not as evident in the teachings of the Waldensians during the earliest period. There is
undoubtedly some platonic asceticism involved in Waldo' renunciation of wealth. Many of
the new groups, including the mendicant orders of monks were renouncing all wealth at this
time, and traveling around as beggars and preachers.35 </p>

<p>It is important to realize that the reason they did so was not in order to relieve
poverty through a more equitable distribution of goods, but because the suffering incurred
from being poor was good for the soul. The material world was viewed with suspicion, and
anything that served to separate one from it would bring him/her closer to the Spiritual
world, that is, closer to God.36 </p>

<p>Significantly, shortly after the time of Waldo, Boanaventure would argue that poverty
had been Christ's pattern, carried on for some time by monks such as the Egyptian
anchorites, &quot;but poverty declined after the Donation of Constantine and was not
revived until the thirteenth century with the foundation of religious mendicancy by
Francis and Dominic.&quot; This view of history was identical to that held by the
Waldensians.37 </p>

<p>Tourn and others argue that this ascetic ideological base was not the case with the
Waldensians. Their basis for renunciation of wealth was a literalistic application of Lk.
9:3-6, and Mk. 10:23-27, which are not ascetic. In other words, &quot;. . .one might say
that Waldensian piety was eschatological rather than dualist or ascetic.&quot;38 </p>

<p>This may be partially true for another reason. We find no reference to the monastic
literature anywhere in the early Waldensian literature. The Cistercian order, which had
been organized around 1119 believed that, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>. . .the rule (of St. Benedict) was not merely a guideline or a set of positive laws
  which can be dispensed, but rather a species of Divine Law, which like the Commandments of
  the Gospel, has to be interpreted, but cannot be changed or dispensed.39 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This point of view, so typical of all of the orders at this time, is absent from early
Waldensian thinking. They based their movement of the authority of the scriptures.40 </p>

<p>Another distinction between the Waldensians and the monastic idealists at this time was
the outward focus of the Poor of Lyons. They were not seeking primarily inner piety, but
aggressive outreach to others. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;. . .Waldo's case was different [than most poverty enthusiasts]. His vow did not
  lead him to a monastery and to a life of contemplation and obedience. He was an ordinary
  citizen among the poor and was determined to remain so. . .41 </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;For the Poor the bond of unity lay not in the sacraments but in their apostolic
  mission. Christian virtue, then, was in demonstrating love, and care for the brethren. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Everyone of them, old and young, men and women, by day and by night, do not stop
  their learning and teaching of others.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>An inquisitor quotes, in the same vein, one of the Poor who had been brought before
him: &quot;In our home, women teach as well as men, and one who has been a student for a
week teaches another.&quot; 42 </p>

<p>Thus the Waldensians were more activistic and outreaching than sacramental or
reflective.43</p>

<hr>

<h3>Waldensians Compared to Fransciscans</h3>

<p>Perhaps if there had been more dependence on monastic ideology the later history of the
Waldensians would have been very different. Not long after the time of Waldo, another new
order arose not far from the region of Lombardy under the leadership of Francis of Assisi.
The similarities between these groups is quite striking. </p>

<p>Both were operating in the same area at about the same time. Francis was also untrained
in theology. His followers, like the Waldensians, were unlearned. They lived in voluntary
poverty, dressing in course cloth and sandals--exactly like the Waldensians. They traveled
around sometimes and preached, as the Waldensians did, although the emphasis with the
Franciscans was more on service while that of the Waldensians was more on preaching. Both
were critical of the Roman Church's failure to fully live up to the ideals of Scripture.
Both went to Rome to obtain papal approval for their orders. And this is where the
similarity stops. </p>

<p>Francis did obtain approval from the Pope, while Waldo did not.44 Thus the Franciscans
were taken into the embrace of the Church. This exempted them from persecution for the
time being, and in fact, Franciscans were often leaders of the persecution of the
Waldensians. </p>

<p>The question of the relationship of the Waldensians to the other doctrinal currents of
that time is hard to determine exactly. There is no evidence of any influence from other
groups on Waldo himself, until after his condemnation. Earlier, for instance, he directly
denounced the Albigensians' doctrine.45 </p>

<p>The most important point in this is that there was no ideological or theological
breakthrough that occasioned the Waldensian movement.46 Their existence was not the result
of any change in theology, but rather a change in theopraxy--the Poor of Lyons translated
the Bible, and preached it in their own words.47 Thus, the Waldensians are an early test
case in the area of lay ministry. Their main sin was to take too literally the Biblical
command to, &quot;. . .teach them to observe all that I commanded you.&quot; </p>

<p>Not only did they refuse to deny the right of the laity to preach and teach, they also
allowed and encouraged women to teach. This had tremendous shock effect on their culture,
at the same time that it probably tapped an hitherto unknown source of power.48 It would
be easy to underestimate the impact that this feature had on the Europe of 1170. </p>

<p>It was after their excommunication that the Poor of Lyons' doctrine became
objectionable to the Roman Catholic Church. More than a hundred years later, it was said, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Among all the sects, there is none more pernicious to the Church than that of the
  leonists, and for three reasons: </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>In the first place, because it is one of the most ancient; for some say that it dates
    back to the time of Sylvester; others to the time of the Apostles. </li>
  <li>In the second place, because it is the most widespread. There is hardly a country where
    it does not exist. </li>
  <li>In the third place, because, if other sects strike with horror those who listen to them,
    the Leonists, on the contrary, possess a great outward appearance of piety. As a matter of
    fact they lead irreproachable lives before men, and as regards their faith and the
    articles of their creed, they are orthodox. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Their one conspicuous fault is, that they blaspheme against the Church and the clergy,
  points on which laymen in general are known to be too easily led away.49 </p>

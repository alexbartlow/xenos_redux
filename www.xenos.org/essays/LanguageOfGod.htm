<h3>By <a href="../personal/den.htm">Dennis McCallum</a></h3>
<p class="style1"><em>The Language of God</em> is an interesting read from one of the  world's most prestigious scientists. He recounts his own conversion from  agnosticism to theism, and goes on to examine how a personal creator accords  with the findings of science. This book could be very helpful  to non-believers when questioning their own agnosticism or atheism. I found it  less useful as a guide to a Christian view of origins.</p>
<h2 class="style1"><em>Collins' Objections to 'God of the Gaps' Arguments</em></h2>
<p class="style1">Collins says, "Faith that places God in the gaps of current  understanding about the natural world may be headed for crisis if advances in  science subsequently fill those gaps."<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" class="style2">1</a>  This  is an oft-repeated point in other's work, and has a lot of history behind it.  However, there are gaps which should be filled in our understanding by God.  Every time a miracle happens, we have something we don't understand. And God is  the explanation. Every act of God in history is a gap that, properly  understood, is filled with God. While it's easy to err and attribute to God's  intervention things that have natural causes, this only means we should be  careful. It does not mean that gaps in scientific knowledge may indeed be  answered best by divine intervention.</p>
<p class="style1">Collins is eager to avoid giving God as the reason unexplainable  things in natural history. But what is the difference between seeing God in the  unbridgeable gap between simple organic compounds and living cells on one hand  (which Collins resists), and between the big bang and whatever happened  beforehand on the other (which Collins accepts)? Using a God of the gaps  argument seems to be okay in some situations, but the rules are unclear.<br>
  Referring to inorganic evolution and why it would be unwise  to assume God is responsible, he says,</p>
<blockquote class="style1">
  <p> There are good reasons to believe  in God, including the existence of mathematical principles and order in  creation. They are positive reasons based on knowledge, rather than default  assumptions based on (a temporary) lack of knowledge."<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" class="style2">2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style1">  He seems to believe that science will soon explain inorganic  evolution also, so we shouldn't attribute it to God. I thought this position  was way too cautious.</p>
<p class="style1">Discussing the Cambrian explosion, he says,</p>
<blockquote class="style1">
  <p>While attempts have been made by certain  theists to argue that the Cambrian explosion is evidence of the intervention of  some supernatural force, a careful examination of the facts does not seem to  warrant this. This is another "God of the gaps" argument, and once again  believers would be unwise to hang their faith upon such a hypothesis."<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" class="style2">3</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style1">I see no argument or evidence given here to back this rejection  of divine intervention at or around the Cambrian explosion. Whether the  theistic position is a 'gaps argument' begs the question and is <em>ad hominem</em>. <em>Ad hominem</em> means "against the man" where  instead of refuting one's evidence, you point out he is making a similar  argument to a discredited other (like Hitler), or in this case, earlier  mistaken Christians. It's an invalid form of argument, because the fact that  someone else messed up when using a similar argument means nothing about  whether the present case is messed up.</p>
<p class="style1">The fact is that our <em>observable  data</em> show huge discontinuities in the fossil record appearing in short time  spans. Of course we can speculate about possible explanations that would still  allow for the slow transitions required by Darwinian Theory, but such  speculations have no backing in observable data, and cannot be considered  science. This is particularly hard to accept when layers of sediment (like  limestone) from the same ocean show change happening between one layer and  another. Why would the ocean stop depositing sediment and then start again? In  cases where the ocean dried up for a period and re-filled (which has happened  numerous times with shallow inland seas) you can see clear signs that this is  what happened.</p>
<p class="style1"> The only argument I could see by Collins was that "The  so-called Cambrian explosion might, for example, reflect a change in conditions  that allowed fossilization of a large number of species that had actually been  in existence for millions of years,"<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" class="style2">4</a> How  is this explanation for the gap any different or any better than the hypothesis  that God intervened at this point in history? I agree with him that we cannot  be dogmatic on such ancient issues. I also agree that people shouldn't "hang  their faith" on the assumption that God intervened here. But the theistic  hypothesis seems far more plausible to me than some worldwide change in fossil  formation capability. An appeal to some change in the way fossils form, which  formerly allowed microscopic fossils, but afterward allowed larger, complex  fossils seems rather desperate to me. Normally larger organisms form fossils  most easily. He gives no clear description of how this change would happen, or  why.</p>
<p class="style1"> Atheists argue that people have erroneously used the 'God of  the gaps' argument before, and therefore we should never use it again. Similarly,  amillenialists ague that people have erroneously argued that the end times are  at hand based on so-called 'signs,' so we should never again argue that case. Both  of these are fallacious arguments.</p>
<p class="style1"> Just because God was wrongly blamed for being the cause of  certain gaps in understanding (like what causes disease) doesn't mean there are  no gaps that should be attributed to God. This would lead to a completely  naturalistic worldview. Miracles would be impossible. All apparent  interventions by God would have to be left in abeyance in the belief that  someday science will explain it.</p>
<p class="style1">  Collins doesn't deny the reality of miracles, and in fact  says he believes in them. But his method makes it necessary to prove something  is a miracle before believing in it. Many miracles can't be proven, but are  real. I'm not commenting on Collins' beliefs here, I'm commenting on his  methodology.</p>
<p class="style1">  Likewise, just because people argued falsely that the end  times were at hand based on signs that were misinterpreted doesn't mean that  the end times won't be signaled by signs correctly interpreted, as Jesus  clearly teaches in the parable of the fig tree (Mat. 24:32, 33). Such <em>ad hominem</em> arguments would be analogous  to saying that since evolution was the basis for National Socialism and communism;  we should never appeal to evolution for any explanations.</p>
<p class="style1">  In a word, the fact that people have used a line of  reasoning poorly in the past doesn't mean the line of reasoning is  discredited&mdash;only their improper use of it. Collins himself has suggested at  least one gap that should be attributed to God (the big bang), and grudgingly  admits that another (inorganic evolution) <em>could</em> be explained by God. As biblical theists, we believe there are many gaps that  should be explained by God's action in history.</p>
<h2 class="style1"><em>Macroevolution and the fossil record</em></h2>
<p class="style1">Collins' rejection of the distinction between macro and  microevolution (p. 132) is based on an overly narrow definition of  microevolution. I agree that Christians often err here, by claiming that no new  species have appeared through evolution. The evidence is good that many species  are the result of evolution. I have always held that in the expression, "after  its own kind," (Gen. 1) the word 'kind' is not defined. It could mean species,  genus, family, or even phyla or something larger. I also agree with Collins  that the idea of macroevolution has no clear definition and is therefore a  somewhat vague concept. But I think it is still useful for declaring that  evolution has some limits in what it can explain. "Reproducing  after its own kind" has to mean something. The rules of exegesis say you can't  just ignore language that doesn't fit your theory. If the amoeba gave rise to  humans, then what does "reproducing after its own kind" mean? The phrase seems  to be saying there were limits within which organisms reproduce. If not this,  what does it mean?</p>
<h2 class="style1"><em>Fossils</em></h2>
<p class="style1">Collins never adequately addresses the larger question of  jumps in the fossil record. Even the discovery of some possible transitional  forms (where formerly there were none) cannot be reasonably extrapolated to  mean that all missing transitions will eventually be found, or that they once  existed, but were never preserved in the fossil record. This is a faith  position without observable backing. It fills the gaps with imagined fossils  that have never actually been seen. It also fails to speak to the stability of  species in the fossil record, where most species appear relatively suddenly,  stay very stable throughout their history (except for minor changes like size)  and then often disappear. This picture does not fit Darwinian assumptions. Think  of the famous case of the horse. The changes seen in the fossil record are  basically a change in size, which is qualitatively different than the kind of  changes one would need to see in order to demonstrate macro-evolution. </p>
<p class="style1">  Collins' proposition (that transitions may have occurred  during periods when fossils were not deposited) means that such suspensions in  fossil deposition would have to happen worldwide even in very different sedimentary  strata, deposited in different ways. For instance, some are deposited by  oceans, some by rivers, and some fossils come from animals trapped in tar pits  or amber, to name a few. These would all have to suspend fossil making for many  millions of years <em>at the same time</em> in  order to explain why the discontinuous layers we have are really continuous and  relatively constant in rate of change, as predicted by Darwin.  Why would this happen? I think this is a huge leap of faith, and even atheist  paleontologists like Gould use this same data to back up the need for  punctuated equilibrium (which is leap of faith in itself).</p>
<p class="style1">  The last research I did on this about three years ago  indicated that only a handful of debatable links have been found, and that  thousands of gaps remain as striking as ever. Robert Carroll observes recently  in <em>Nature</em>, "What  is missing are the many intermediate forms hypothesized by Darwin, and the continual divergence of major lineages into the morphospace between distinct adaptive types."<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" class="style2">5</a> Even in cases where possible transition fossils have been discovered,  they are usually far distant from either the parent line, or the line they are  supposed to explain, and authorities disagree on whether many of them are  really transitional forms at all.</p>
<p class="style1">  His efforts to argue that fossils are rare and the record  extremely fragmentary is unconvincing. At every geological period, millions and  even billions of fossils survive. The problem (not acknowledged or discussed by  Collins, except in the case of the Cambrian explosion) is that strata  containing abundant fossil remains from entire new orders lie immediately  adjacent to strata containing none of these organisms or anything similar. This  widespread phenomenon remains a major problem for Darwinian theorists. Collins'  general statements about the difficulty of making fossils did nothing to answer  this problem. Of course only a minority of organisms are ever preserved in  fossil form. But as anyone who has studied fossils knows, this minority still  usually numbers in the millions for most categories.</p>
<p class="style1">  I believe his claim that the former view (that there were  huge gaps all over the place) has now been refuted, is wrong. Authorities  writing recently still argue that most significant gaps remain. The sudden  appearance of new phyla, genera, and families is remarkable today as it has  been. The only place I have seen such sweeping claims that the problems with  fossils are not in the past is on atheist websites with low credibility.</p>
<p class="style1">  Collins does not demonstrate careful study of the fossil  record (geology and paleontology are not his area of expertise), and this is a  serious weakness in his argument. Fossils remain the only objective data we  have for what actually happened. Mathematical extrapolations from genetics does  not stand, in my view, at the same level of credibility as the actual history  as seen in the fossil record. </p>
<p class="style1">  I admit that an explanation could conceivably be found one  day for the discontinuities in the fossil record. But I believe the evidence  today still conforms to a picture of periodic dramatic changes in plant and  animal populations, and these are used to date sedimentary strata, because  other strata are missing these forms. This picture is not easily explained by  pure natural selection, and could indeed represent creative episodes where God  intervened.</p>
<h2 class="style1"><em>Interpreting molecular similarities</em></h2>
<p class="style1">Collins shows compelling evidence for similarity between  human and mouse DNA, even in non-functional sections. His conclusion is that  such similarity denotes common ancestry. But while similarity could denote a  common ancestor, it could also denote a common maker. Is it reasonable to  assume that God would start from scratch every time he introduced a new order  of organisms (assuming this happened)? Or would he begin with existing forms,  and alter them in meaningful ways to produce the new order? I don't know how we  could answer these questions. Clearly, if the notion that God periodically  introduced new forms is true, the evidence suggests that he used existing forms  as templates from which to build the new forms. This could explain the data just  as well as evolution.</p>
<p class="style1">  As an analogy, consider the way programmers produce a new  computer program. They normally do not begin from scratch, but use helpful  strings of code from previous programs they have written for various functions.  Likewise, a Bible teacher will commonly include illustrations and arguments he  has used in earlier teachings when constructing a new one. These similarities  don't imply that the new program or teaching sprang from the former, but that  the creator of both used existing material combined with new material to  produce the new creations.</p>
<p class="style1">  Collins admits that these similarities are only found "over  substantial stretches" and "in some instances."<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" class="style2">6</a> He  also concedes that, "one might argue that the order of genes is critical in  order for their function to occur properly, and therefore a designer might have  maintained that order in multiple acts of special creation."<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" class="style2">7</a> But  he feels that, "there is no evidence from current understanding of molecular  biology that this restriction would need to apply over such substantial  chromosomal distances." In other words, the similarity of sequence is longer  than necessary for the functions involved. But this observation doesn't rule  out the use of even relatively long similar chains by a designer. It only shows  that such borrowing would not be necessary as far as we know. Indeed, understanding of the function of non-coding sections of DNA is constantly growing.<a href="#_ftn7b" name="_ftnref7b" class="style2">7b</a></p>
<p class="style1">  He concludes: "this kind of recent genome data thus presents  and overwhelming challenge to those who hold to the idea that all species were  created <em>ex nihilo</em>."  I think this conclusion is warranted. But it may be a bit of a straw-man as  well. Only extreme creationists continue to hold that all species were  specially created. I fail to see why believers would argue this extreme position.  However, the genome data do not present an overwhelming challenge to the view  that God engaged in multiple creative acts at various points, combined with  evolution.</p>

<p class="style1">Collins says, "The concern about not accepting liberal  interpretations of biblical texts is understandable."<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" class="style2">8</a>  But  he also says, "&hellip;parts of the Bible, such as the first few chapters of Genesis,  the book of Job, the Song of Solomon, and the Psalms, have a more lyrical and  allegorical flavor, and do not seem to carry the marks of pure historical  narrative."<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" class="style2">9</a>  He adds,  "to most other interpreters throughout history, until Darwin put believers on  the defensive, the first chapters of Genesis had much more the feel of a  morality play than an eyewitness report on the evening news."<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" class="style2">10</a>  His view here only reflects Roman Catholic allegorizing during the medieval  period, which was not only applied to these passages but to most historical  narrative in the Bible. Allegorical hermeneutics were rejected well before  Darwin by evangelical interpreters, and for reasons different than that assumed  by Collins.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" class="style2">11</a> </p>
<p class="style1">  These statements clearly signal that Collins has a view of  scripture deemed unacceptable to the vast majority of evangelical scholarship  and contrary to our own statement of faith. Consider the following articles  from the "Chicago Statement on Biblical Hermeneutics" that are violated by  these statements (key phrases that I think are denied are in bold):</p>
<blockquote class="style1">
  <p align="center">    Article VI.</p>
  <p>    WE AFFIRM that the Bible expresses God's truth in propositional statements,  and we declare that biblical truth is both objective and absolute. We further  affirm that <strong>a statement is true if it represents matters as they actually  are, but is an error if it misrepresents the facts</strong>.</p>
  <p align="center">Article XIII.</p>
  <p>WE AFFIRM that awareness of the literary categories, formal and stylistic,  of the various parts of Scripture is essential for proper exegesis, and hence  we value genre criticism as one of the many disciplines of biblical study.</p>
  <p><strong>WE DENY that generic categories which negate  historicity may rightly be imposed on biblical narratives which present  themselves as factual</strong>.</p>
  <p align="center">Article XV.</p>
  <p>WE AFFIRM <strong>the necessity of interpreting the Bible according to its  literal, or normal, sense</strong>. The literal sense is the grammatical-historical  sense, that is, the meaning which the writer expressed. Interpretation  according to the literal sense will take account of all figures of speech and  literary forms found in the text.</p>
  <p>WE DENY the legitimacy of any approach to  Scripture that attributes to it meaning which the literal sense does not  support. <em>[such as allegory&#8212;Dennis]</em></p>
  <p align="center">Article XX.</p>
  <p>WE AFFIRM that since God is the author of all truth, all truths, biblical  and extrabiblical, are consistent and cohere, and  that <strong>the Bible speaks truth when it touches on matters pertaining to nature</strong>,  history, or anything else. We further affirm that in some cases extrabiblical data have value for clarifying what Scripture  teaches, and for prompting correction of faulty interpretations.</p>
  <p>WE DENY that extrabiblical  views ever disprove the teaching of Scripture or hold priority over it.</p>
  <p align="center">Article XXII.</p>
  <p><strong>WE AFFIRM that Genesis 1-11 is factual, as is the rest of the book.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>WE DENY that the teachings of Genesis 1-11  are mythical and that scientific hypotheses about earth history or the origin  of humanity may be invoked to overthrow what Scripture teaches about creation.</strong><br>
    Also note these statements from the "Chicago Statement on  Biblical Inerrancy:"<br>
    4. Being wholly and verbally God-given, Scripture is without  error or fault in all its teaching, <strong>no less in what it states about God's  acts in creation</strong>, about the events of world history, and about its own  literary origins under God, than in its witness to God's saving grace in  individual lives.</p>
  <p align="center">Article  XII.</p>
  <p>We  affirm that Scripture in its entirety is inerrant, being free from all  falsehood, fraud, or deceit. </p>
  <p>We  deny that Biblical infallibility and inerrancy are limited to spiritual,  religious, or redemptive themes, exclusive of assertions in the fields of  history and science. <strong>We further deny that scientific hypotheses about earth  history may properly be used to overturn the teaching of Scripture on creation</strong> and the flood. </p>
  <p><em>[Their point here is that we begin with  exegesis and determine the limits allowed. THEN we go to science as it stands  today to see what is more or less likely within those limits. The wrong  approach would be to reach conclusions via science, and then make scripture fit  that conclusion&mdash;which is exactly the approach Collins takes when he dismisses  Gen 1-11 as history. &ndash; Dennis]</em></p>
  <p align="center">Article  XVI. <br>
  </p>
  <p>We  affirm that the doctrine of inerrancy has been integral to the Church's faith  throughout its history. </p>
  <p><strong>We  deny that inerrancy is a doctrine invented by scholastic Protestantism, or is a  reactionary position postulated in response to negative higher criticism. </strong></p>
  <p align="center">Article  XVIII.</p>
  <p>We  affirm that the text of Scripture is to be interpreted by grammatico-historical  exegesis, taking account of its literary forms and devices, and that Scripture  is to interpret Scripture.</p>
  <p>    We  deny the legitimacy of any treatment of the text or quest for sources lying  behind it <strong>that leads or relativizing, dehistoricizing,  or discounting its teaching</strong>, or rejecting its claims of authorship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style1">    I think Collins' approach to scripture violates all of these  statements, and is completely unacceptable for Bible believers. Such a view  could prove a stumbling block to the weak and unlearned.</p>
<p class="style1">  Jesus affirmed that the early chapters of Genesis were  historical and factual. Remember that our information on Adam and Eve, and the  fall of the human race are contained in these "allegorical" and "morality play"  chapters. This is why evangelicals believe these chapters are historical, not a  defensive reaction to Darwin.</p>
<p class="style1">  Since Collins' method emanates from a base that is not  constrained by a high view of scripture, his method is faulty. Therefore, we  must be very careful about accepting his views based on that method.</p>
<p class="style1">Contrast his view of scripture with his view of science: </p>
<blockquote class="style1">
  <p>"Science is progressive and  self-correcting: no significantly erroneous conclusions or false hypotheses can  be sustained for long, as newer observations will ultimately knock down  incorrect constructs."<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" class="style2">12</a>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style1">  I think Collins' faith in science is extreme and  unwarranted. Critics of scientism like Kuhn have demonstrated multiple cases  where exactly what Collins thinks could never happen <em>has</em> happened (see his <em>The  Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em>). Collins' faith in science contrasts  strongly with his lack of confidence in scripture, and calls further in to  question his underlying assumptions and methods.</p>
<h2 class="style1"><em>Collins on Intelligent Design</em></h2>
<p class="style1">Collins' assumption that scientists would never ignore or  marginalize a new view, just because it's based on theistic assumptions seems  quite na&iuml;ve to me. Why would scientists be any different than other humans?  While they may like formulating new theories, adopting a position that would  lead to their own marginalization is not likely.</p>
<p class="style1">  Collins disqualifies ID as science because "A viable  scientific theory predicts other findings and suggests approaches for further  experimental verification." But "ID's proposal of the intervention of  supernatural forces to account for complex multi-component biological entities  is a scientific dead end. Outside of the development of a time machine,  verification of the ID theory seems profoundly unlikely."<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" class="style2">13</a> I  think this criticism fails for more than one reason.</p>
<p class="style1">  First, macroevolution (as I have defined it above) suffers  the same criticism as ID. It prescribes no future approach for experimental  verification. Experimental verification of natural selection or of genetic  mutation is not the same as verification for macroevolution. Faith in  macroevolution rests entirely on interpretation of existing data and has never  been validated experimentally, or observed.</p>
<p class="style1">  Second, while we would have to go back in a time machine to  verify ID, we would also need one to validate macroevolution. Collins fails to  see that believing in a process that has immense gaps in the fossil record, and  no explanation for how it began in the first place is no better than believing  in a far more plausible explanation, such as intervention by a designer.</p>
<p class="style1">  I thought his call for ID to give a mechanism for how the  intelligence gets into the design was unrealistic.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" class="style2">14</a> This  would be nothing but speculation at best. Any number of possibilities could be  suggested, but these would probably only be used to ridicule the position. ID  is primarily a critique of a pure Darwinian explanation for nature. Collins  seems to imply that ID is in the same category as young earthers,  but most are in fact Darwinists within limits. The material I have seen is  arguing that Darwin's theory is  inadequate to explain all transitions. Most do not deny Darwinian principles  across the board.</p>
<p class="style1">  His arguments that current design in humans is imperfect and  flawed, thus making it unlikely they come from God, are very familiar arguments  found in enlightenment writings &ndash; Darwin, Hume, and others advanced these same arguments,  and they have been answered satisfactorily.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" class="style2">15</a> I  was surprised to see a theist using these well-known atheistic arguments.</p>
<p class="style1">  I thought his rejection of the flagellum argument was  unconvincing and rhetorically loaded. He throws in qualifiers like "presumably"  such and so could have happened, and admits "we are far from filling in the  whole picture (if we ever can)," but on these bases, he concludes "Recent  research has fundamentally undercut this [ID] position."<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" class="style2">16</a> The research he mentions did nothing more than suggest a highly speculative  possibility without observable backing [that flagella could have been borrowed  toxin injectors somehow converted to a completely different function]. How does  this fundamentally undercut anything? I thought it highly questionable that an  organelle used to inject toxin into other bacteria would spontaneously begin to  spin as a means of motility, and thereafter be reproduced for that purpose. I'm  sure Behe et al. would point out that this transition  would have to happen for all parts of the flagellum in a very short time in  order to bestow any enhanced survivability. I can't believe Collins thinks the  matter is closed based on this speculation.</p>
<p class="style1">  I have never felt that the flagellum and related arguments  were the most persuasive part of ID (their work on inorganic evolution is far  more convincing, since the mechanisms of mutation and selection are not  available as an explanation). But I did not feel that mere resemblance to amino  acid sequences in a somewhat similar organelle that had a completely different  function could be called "fundamentally undercutting" the flagellum argument.</p>
<p class="style1">  He also characterizes irreducible complexity as the  foundation for ID, and that is inaccurate. That is only one argument use by the  group, and in my mind, it is one of the least convincing. The recent discovery  that bacteria and viruses can adopt and assimilate loose strands of inter-cellular  DNA into their own DNA (not mentioned by Collins) could raise problems for this  theory as well.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" class="style2">17</a></p>
<p class="style1">  He completely fails to deal with their much more substantial  work in inorganic evolution. This is a critical shortcoming in his critique. He  also fails to deal with Dembski's analysis of what  constitutes evidence of design in nature.</p>
<p class="style1">  Collins includes a theological critique centering again on  the 'God of the gaps' complaint dealt with earlier, and a specious claim that  ID pictures an incompetent God who needs to intervene periodically to "correct"  his shortcomings in previous creation. Neither of these was convincing.</p>
<p class="style1">The reasons for progressive creation would not need to be  correcting errors or deficiencies. Anyone who has added to his garden during  successive years understands why the creative work done last year may be supplemented  without any suggestion that the previous work was mistaken. The pleasure of  creating is reason enough for a creative being to act. For all we know,  progressive acts of creation may have been appropriate because conditions were  developing on the planet during long intervals that made further advances  possible. There could be other reasons. This critique is an interpretation  loaded with negative assumptions not based on any evidence. It is also possible  that natural selection and mutation are incapable of developing beyond certain  inherent limits.</p>
<p class="style1">  Collins is completely negative about ID. He predicts it is a  ship headed for the bottom of the ocean.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" class="style2">18</a> I  thought he gave no adequate basis for this caustic assessment. Young people in  our church have supplied me with evidence that in recent months, weblogs and other groups discussing science and  Christianity have suddenly shifted from favoring ID to declaring it now "disproven," that "it sucks," and "is stupid." I think  Collins' very popular book is having a dramatic but unwarranted impact.</p>
<h2 class="style1"><em>"Biologos"</em></h2>
<p class="style1">Collins' version of theistic evolution should be called <em>deistic</em> evolution. He only allows God a  role at the very beginning, setting up the machine at the time of the big bang.  Even the arrival of abstract intelligence, morality, and the desire for God  were apparently natural developments.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" class="style2">19</a>  God's role is limited to foreknowing that evolution would take this path.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" class="style2">20</a>  His  position is even more deistic than Darwin's  own position, because Darwin said: "Therefore  I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have  ever lived upon this earth have descended from one primordial form into which  life was first breathed by the Creator."<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" class="style2">21</a>  Collins  won't even allow for God launching the first living cells.</p>
<p class="style1">  Collins' analysis of why people resist this deistic theory  of origins centers on two specious reasons&mdash;1) that people don't like theism  associated with evolution, and 2) that they prefer controversy to harmony. I  can't think of anyone who resists deism for these reasons.</p>
<p class="style1">  The real reason Christians resist deism is biblical authority  and sound exegesis. Here, Collins reveals his method again, in a way consistent  with his earlier chapters: Genesis 1 and 2 are figurative. Adam and Eve were  not the only humans, because of Cain's wife. Therefore they are probably just a  representative story of how people don't obey God. C.S. Lewis and the Pope  agree that the passages should not be taken literally or historically. The  lyrical character puts them in the same category as Job and Jonah, which do not  carry a "historical ring."<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" class="style2">22</a></p>
<p class="style1">  As noted earlier, these verdicts fly in the face of Jesus'  clear teaching that "God said" the things recorded in Gen 2 to Adam. Jesus  likened his resurrection to Jonah's expulsion by the fish. According to this  reasoning, if the Jonah story was mythical, Jesus' resurrection could be  mythical also. Paul teaches that just as sin entered through one man,  justification entered through one man. Again, if Adam's fall was mythical,  wouldn't this mean that Jesus' death and resurrection could be the same? How  did the fallen nature pass to other humans? Clearly the Adam and Eve story is  impossible if humans evolved in a transitional community of organisms probably  comprising thousands of members, as Collins assumes. I hope we all see that  viewing humans as the product of evolution alone means the rejection of a  literal Adam and Eve. It also offers no adequate explanation for a spiritual  nature that would even survive death.</p>
<p class="style1">Collins' view of scripture is completely unacceptable.</p>
<p class="style1">  On page 83, Collins gives us two choices where Genesis  interpretation is concerned: hyper-literal young earth hermeneutics, and  non-historical poetic license. His coverage in this section demonstrates no  understanding of other interpretive positions. Throughout this section, he  shows little depth of understanding either of the interpretive issues in  Genesis or of the theological issues raised by his low view of scripture.</p>
<h2 class="style1"><em>Our Position</em></h2>
<p class="style1">I would be very concerned if Xenos leaders recommend this  book to our people without the strongest warnings. Indeed, I see little reason  to recommend the book at all except to advanced believers. We should remember  how easily people in Xenos have been led to doubt the early chapters of Genesis  in the past. Collins stands close enough to biblical faith to be very  appealing, especially because of his preeminence in the scientific community.  But while learning from his advanced scholarship in genetics, people could also  easily buy into his poorly informed views on scripture.</p>
<p class="style1">  For us, the determining limits to which theories may be  accepted should be biblical exegesis. I believe we have no reason to declare  which theory or combination is the correct one, only which theories are  possible within a biblical framework.</p>

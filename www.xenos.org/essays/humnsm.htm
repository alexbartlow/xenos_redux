<span class="style1">Humanism is an ideology based on the centrality of humankind. It is possible to espouse
theistic humanism, or even Christian Humanism. In these cases, the term humanism means a
concern for humanistic goals, with the understanding that God is the final solution to
man's needs. Secular humanism, on the other hand, implies a focus on man apart from God,
whether or not God exists.</span>
<h3 class="style1">Recognizing Secular Humanism</h3>

<h5 class="style1">The following statements are drawn from the Humanist Manifesto I written in 1933.
Signed by many of the leading atheistic scholars of that day, it was the benchmark test
for so-called &quot;religious humanism&quot; up until 1973, and continues to embody many
of the key values of this world view.</h5>

<blockquote class="style1">
  <p>&quot;Humanism believes that man is a part of nature and that he has emerged 
    as the result of a continuous process.&quot; </p>
  <p>&quot;Holding an organic view of life, humanists find that the traditional 
    dualism of mind and body must be rejected.&quot; </p>
  <p>&quot;Humanism asserts that the nature of the universe depicted by modern 
    science makes unacceptable any supernatural or cosmic guarantee of human values.&quot;  </p>
  <p>&quot;We are convinced that the time has passed for theism, deism, modernism, 
    and several varieties of 'new thought'.&quot; </p>
  <p>&quot;Religion consists of those actions, purposes, and experiences which 
    are humanly significant . . . all that is in its degree expressive of intelligently 
    satisfying human living.&quot; </p>
  <p>&quot;In place of the old attitudes involved in worship and prayer the humanist 
    finds his religious emotions expressed in a heightened sense of personal life 
    and in a cooperative effort to promote social well-being.&quot; </p>
  <p>&quot;Man will learn to face the crises of life in terms of his knowledge 
    of their naturalness and probability.&quot; </p>
  <p>&quot;Believing that religion must work increasingly for joy in living, religious 
    humanists aim to foster the creativity in man and to encourage achievements 
    that add to satisfaction in life.&quot; </p>
  <p>&quot;The humanists are firmly convinced that existing acquisitive and profit-motivated 
    society has shown itself to be inadequate and that radical change in methods, 
    controls, and motives must be instituted.&quot; </p>
  <p>&quot;Fifteenth and last: We assert that humanism will: (a) affirm life rather 
    than deny it; (b) seek to elicit the possibilities of life, not flee from 
    it; (c) endeavor to establish the conditions of a satisfactory life for all, 
    not merely for the few.&quot; [Quoted in Norman L. Geisler, <i>Is Man the 
    Measure? </i>(Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Book House, l983) p.] </p>
</blockquote>
<h5 class="style1">The Humanist Manifesto II was written in 1973. This document was signed by such
notables as the author Isaac Asimov; professors Brand Blanshard, Anthony Flew, and A.J.
Ayer; psychologist B.F. Skinner; situational ethicist Joseph Fletcher; and biologist
Jacques Monod. Following are some selections showing the general direction of the
statement.</h5>

<blockquote class="style1">
  <h5>&quot;In the best sense, religion may inspire dedication to the highest 
    ethical ideals. The cultivation of moral devotion and creative imagination 
    is an expression of genuine, 'spiritual' experience and aspiration.&quot; 
    The authors quickly add, however, that &quot;traditional dogmatic or authoritarian 
    religions . . . do a disservice to the human species.&quot; Further, they 
    &quot;find insufficient evidence for the existence of the supernatural.&quot; 
    For as &quot;non-theists, we begin with humans not God, nature not deity.&quot; 
    Moreover, &quot;we can discover no divine purpose or providence for the human 
    species.&quot; Hence, &quot;no deity will save us; we must save ourselves.&quot;</h5>
  <h5>&quot;Promises of immortal salvation and fear of eternal damnation are both 
    illusory and harmful.&quot; Why? Because &quot;they distract humans from present 
    concerns, from self-actualization, and from rectifying social injustices.&quot; 
    Moreover, science has found &quot;no credible evidence that life survives 
    the death of the body.&quot; </h5>
  <h5>&quot;We affirm that moral values derive their source from human experience. 
    Ethics is autonomous and situational, needing no theological or ideological 
    sanction.&quot; </h5>
  <h5>&quot;Sixth: In the area of sexuality, we believe that intolerant attitudes 
    often cultivated by orthodox religions and puritanical cultures, unduly repress 
    sexual conduct.&quot; The authors affirm &quot;the right to birth control, 
    abortion, and divorce.&quot; They also permit any form of &quot;sexual behavior 
    between consenting adults,&quot; for &quot;short of harming others or compelling 
    them to do likewise, individuals should be permitted to express their sexual 
    proclivities and pursue their lifestyles as they desire.&quot;</h5>
</blockquote>
<h5 class="style1">It calls for &quot;the highest commitment [i.e., to these values] of which we are
capable,&quot; a commitment which &quot;transcends . . . church, state, party, class, or
race.&quot; [Quoted in Norman L. Geisler, <u>Is Man the Measure?</u> pp.*ll5-*ll8]</h5>

<h5 class="style1">Later still, a number of the signatories of the second manifesto produced a document
called, &quot;A Secular Humanist Declaration.&quot; The intent of this document seems to
have been to remove the religious designation from humanism (hence the term
&quot;Secular&quot;). </h5>

<p class="style1">&quot;It decries contemporary orthodox religion as &quot;anti-science, anti-freedom,
anti-human,&quot; pointing out that &quot;secular humanism places trust in human
intelligence rather than in divine guidance.&quot; It ends by deploring &quot;the growth
of intolerant sectarian creeds that foster hatred.&quot; </p>

<p class="style1">Geisler points out that the turn away from the term &quot;religious humanist&quot; is a
change in tactics, because humanists, &quot;have pleaded for recognition as a religious
group and...has even been defined as a religion by the United States Supreme Court
(Torcaso v. Watkins, l961). [Free Inquiry, Winter l980 - 8l, p.3. also quoted in Norman L.
Geisler, <u>Is Man the Measure?</u> p.120-121] </p>

<h3 class="style1">A Case Study-- Julian Huxley</h3>

<h5 class="style1">To gain a more personal feel for a famous secular humanist thinker, selections are
included from Julian Huxley's book, <i>Religion Without Revelation</i>. Huxley begins by
affirming, </h5>

<blockquote class="style1">
  <p>&quot;I believe firmly that the scientific method...is the only method which 
    in the long run will give satisfactory foundations for beliefs...It consists 
    in demanding facts as the only basis for conclusions; and of consistently 
    and continuously testing any conclusions which may have been reached by new 
    facts and, wherever possible, by the crucial test of experiment. It consists 
    also...in full publication of the evidence on which conclusions are based, 
    so that other workers may...put a quite different interpretation on the facts.&quot;[Julian 
    Huxley, <i>Religion Without Revelation</i>. (New York,NY: Mentor Books, l957) 
    p.l5] </p>
</blockquote>
<h5 class="style1">At the same time he admits that, </h5>

<blockquote class="style1">
  <p>&quot;There are, however, all sorts of occasions on which the scientific 
    method is not applicable...(because) The exigencies of everyday life... make 
    it necessary to act on a hasty balancing of admittedly incomplete evidence, 
    to take immediate action, and to draw conclusions in advance of the evidence.&quot; 
    Therefore, &quot;It is here that belief plays its most important role. When 
    we cannot be certain, we must proceed in part by faith--&quot;[p.16] </p>
</blockquote>
<h5 class="style1">What happened then to the scientific method? To this he responds, </h5>

<blockquote class="style1">
  <p>&quot;When there exists no evidence or next to no evidence, and when the 
    conclusion to which we may come can have no influence on the facts, <i>then 
    it is our duty to suspend judgment</i> and hold no belief, just as definitely 
    as it is our duty, when practical issues hang on our decision, not to suspend 
    judgment, but to take our courage in both hands and act on the best belief 
    at which we can arrive.&quot;[p.17 (Emphasis mine)] </p>
</blockquote>
<h5 class="style1">How does one decide which situation one is in? Huxley explains, </h5>

<blockquote class="style1">
  <p>&quot;I hold it to be an important duty to know when to be agnostic. I believe 
    that one should be agnostic when belief one way or the other is mere idle 
    speculation, incapable of verification: when belief is held merely to gratify 
    desires, however deep-seated, and not because it is forced on us by evidence; 
    and when belief may be taken by others to be more firmly grounded than it 
    really is, and so come to encourage false hopes or wrong attitudes of mind.[p.17 
    (Emphasis mine)] </p>
</blockquote>
<h5 class="style1">Unfortunately, it is at this very point that Huxley manifests an inability to follow
his own creed. He continues, </h5>

<blockquote class="style1">
  <p>&quot;A personal God, be he Jehovah, or Allah, or Apollo, or Amen-Ra, or 
    without name but simply God, I know nothing of.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<h5 class="style1">This would certainly be consistent to a degree. But he goes further,</h5>

<blockquote class="style1">
  <p>&quot;...What is more, I am not merely agnostic on the subject...I disbelieve 
    in a personal God in any sense in which that phrase is ordinarily used.&quot; 
    [p.18 ] </p>
</blockquote>
<h5 class="style1">It seems that Huxley is not withholding judgment here, but that he is affirming a
faith position even though the situation has not &quot;forced&quot; belief on him at all!
He goes on to affirm other faith positions as well, </h5>

<blockquote class="style1"> 
  <p>&quot;I disbelieve in the existence of Heaven or Hell in any conventional 
    Christian sense...&quot; </p>
  <p>&quot;I believe, and believe strongly, that if the standards of good and 
    evil by which we ought to live this life are different from the standards 
    by which we may hope to achieve satisfaction or blessedness in a life to come, 
    then so much the worse for the universe and its governance; but I refuse on 
    that account to modify my standards of conduct in this world, for that appears 
    to me an outrage, and a surrender of the highest part of our nature.&quot; 
    [p.19] </p>
</blockquote>
<h5 class="style1">It would seem as well that the emotional outcome of belief affects his view.</h5>

<blockquote class="style1">
  <p>&quot;For my own part, the sense of spiritual relief which comes from rejecting 
    the idea of God as a supernatural being is enormous.&quot; [p.32]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="style1">Critique</h3>

<p class="style1">We can see from the case above that the presuppositions of the secular humanist betray
his/her own methodology. The key then, for the Christian communicator, is to resist the
science/faith dichotomy, unless it is actually appropriate. In the case of morals,
aesthetics, religion, and philosophy, such a dichotomy is not appropriate. </p>

<p class="style1">Far from being one who has entered the light of scientific objectivity, the secular
humanist is often involved in blind faith of the worst kind. We begin to realize that if
Huxley's new age finally did dawn where, &quot;The insufferable arrogance of those who
claim to be in sole possession of religious truth would happily disappear...&quot; he
would himself be the first to de-materialize. [p.33] </p>

<p class="style1">The debate with secular humanists, then, is intimately tied up with the issue of burden
of proof. If Huxley can claim that a strident denial of theism is holding &quot;no
belief&quot;, and is &quot;scientific&quot;, rather than admitting that it is an
unverified leap of faith, then the theist will obviously be cast in a bad light. </p>

<p class="style1">It is always desirable to divest one's own world view of all burden of proof, while
casting that burden entirely on an opponent. If on the other hand, that burden is shared
equally (as we must insist), the humanist will have to look to his/her own problems as
well. It is to these problems that we now turn.</p>

<h3 class="style1">Problems with Secular Humanist's Positions</h3>

<ol class="style1">
  <ol>
    <li>The claim that all morals &amp; values are relative is first of all self-contradictory, 
      because it is stated as an absolute. There is also the problem of the inability 
      of man to live consistently with it. All men including humanists hold for 
      absolute values. Will the secular humanist admit that there is nothing necessarily 
      (or absolutely) wrong with rape and murder of a three year old girl? Also 
      be aware of the biblical problem with conflicting moral values and with 
      the best answers available. </li>
    <li>To the humanist there is no ultimate meaning to life. Yet no one lives 
      in harmony with this view. The humanist is forced to live as if his life 
      matters, thus belying his own belief. We can be sure that the humanist will 
      not hesitate to point out where the Christian is inconsistent with his/her 
      faith! </li>
    <li>In view of the plausibility of the existence of God, it becomes difficult 
      to see why such energy is expended trying to deny Him. It is often possible 
      to show that the secular humanist is more interested in autonomy in the 
      moral area than in discovering truth. </li>

    <li>Since the secular humanist is attempting to establish a science/religion 
      dichotomy, the worst thing a theist can do is to become inappropriately 
      emotional during a discussion. Yet this has too often been the case. The 
      fundamental church has also ascribed every social evil in our culture to 
      humanists, while ignoring the responsibility of the church for many of those 
      or other problems, whether by commission or omission. The result is the 
      appearance of another witch hunt rather than an objective treatment of the 
      facts. </li>
    <li>Nothing establishes secular humanism faster than the specter of an ignorant 
      foam-flecked fanatic, looking for a secret international conspiracy by humanistic 
      devils. </li>
    <li>It is important to also realize that the modern secular humanist has taken 
      a name for himself that has a history going back as far as the renaissance. 
      The great humanist scholars of that period, however, were mostly theists. 
      Their humanism consisted in taking an interest in the humanities-- including 
      the study of original source writings for the Bible, the classics, and other 
      works. Many humanist scholars also became a part of the reformation. Any 
      attempt by modern secular humanists to identify themselves with these men 
      should be resisted. </li>

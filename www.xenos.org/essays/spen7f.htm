            <p>1Allen C. Deeter, An Historical and Theological Introduction to 
              Philip Jakob Spener's `Pia Desideria': A Study in Early German Pietism 
              with Appendix. Volume 2: Translation of the `Pia Desideria', PhD. 
              Dissertation, Princeton University, (Ann Arbor, Mi.: University 
              Microfilms, Inc. 1963), p. 155. </p>
            <p>2Three of Spener's sisters married pastors, and one of his four 
              brothers also became a pastor, certainly indicating a strong religious 
              environment. Allen C. Deeter, An Historical and Theological Introduction 
              p. 86. </p>
            <p>3The thirty years war ended with the treaty of Westphalia in 1648. 
              &quot;There is no more striking example of the confusion of religious 
              and political interests. . .when freedom of conscience and worship 
              was proclaimed, it was . . .for the princes, not for their subjects.&quot; 
              All the subjects within a given province had to be of one confession. 
              Provinces throughout Europe were designated either Lutheran, Calvinist, 
              or Roman Catholic. Other groups (such as Anabaptists, Quakers, and 
              Mennonites) were outlawed everywhere. H. Daniel-Rops, The Church 
              in the Seventeenth Century, J. J. Buckingham trans. (London: J. 
              M. Dent &amp; Sons Ltd., 1963), pp. 136, 149. </p>

            <p>5For example, see Giorgio Tourn, The Waldensians: The First 800 
              Years (1174-1974), Translated from the Italian by Camillo P. Merlino,

              1980), p. 36, 46 52 63, 64, 65 88-91. </p>
            <p>6Of course there was also a long tradition of church-state fusion, 
              which led few to question this relationship. See Brian Tierney, 
              The Crisis of Church &amp; State: 1050-1300, (Englewood Cliffs, 
              NJ: Prentice-Hall Inc. 1964), for clear commentary and source readings 
              on this subject. </p>

              passed the death sentence upon 20,000 people, mostly witches.&quot; 
              Ernst Stoeffler, The Rise of Evangelical Pietism, p. 182. </p>
            <p>10Stoeffler comments that, &quot;The apologetical and homiletical 
              thunder directed against Reformed and Philippist alike was such 
              as should have been reserved for the devil.&quot; Ernst Stoeffler, 
              The Rise of Evangelical Pietism, p. 184. </p>
            <p>11Theodore G. Tappert, &quot;Introduction to Pia Desideria&quot;, 
              p. 7 He also comments that, &quot;Independent exegesis of the Scriptures 
              had little place in the curriculum at a time when it was assumed 
              that the contents of the Scriptures were adequately expressed in 
              the Confession.&quot; p. 6. </p>
            <p>12&quot;The preachers did a great deal of preaching, but Sermons 
              were so long winded and dry that in some places Kirchenwecker [church 
              awakeners, who would crack or jab those who slept in church with 
              a stick] were employed to keep people from sleeping.&quot; Ernst 
              Stoeffler, The Rise of Evangelical Pietism, p. 186. </p>

              in his early life in his &quot;Selbstbiographie&quot; (Autobiography).

            <p>19Agreeing with Aland, Deeter says, &quot;Dannhauer is important 
              above all others in direct intellectual and theological influence 
              on Spener.&quot; Allen C. Deeter, An Historical and Theological 
              Introduction p. 117. He also points out that one of Dannhauer's 
              pet projects which never came to realization was the founding of 
              a seminary for teaching foreign languages to prepare missionaries 
              for assignments. May this not have been in the background of Spener's 
              thinking during the founding of Halle with its missionary thrust?

            <p>20Allen C. Deeter, An Historical and Theological Introduction p.

              corresponding with him. </p>

            <p>25It is relatively easy to demonstrate that Spener's use of the 
              word &quot;reason&quot; should usually be taken in the sense of 
              &quot;autonomous reason.&quot; This is evident from the fact that 
              at the same time that he resists reading the Scriptures with the 
              use of reason, he prescribes standard hermeneutical rules for the 
              proper interpretation of passages. For example, &quot;Every person 
              reading the Scriptures must first pay attention how the verses fit 
              together and then pay attention to each individual word. Various 
              parts of the Scripture must be compared with one another. . .not 
              too much typological or allegorical understanding. . . One must 
              be particularly careful not to allow reason to rule where faith 
              ought to.&quot; Philip Jacob Spener, &quot;On the Necessary and 
              Useful Reading of the Holy Scriptures,&quot; in Peter C. Erb, ed. 
              Pietists: Selected Writings, (New York: Paulist Pres, 1983), p.

            <p>27He even goes so far as to propose the solution of the book of 
              Acts--a community of goods. Philip Jacob Spener, Pia Desideria, 
              Allen C. Deeter, trans. Bk. II p. 37. </p>
            <p>28He considers this bad enough to cause loss of salvation in the 
              perpetrator. &quot;For Godly faith cannot exist without the Holy 
              Spirit, and the Holy Spirit cannot exist along side of premeditated 
              and prevailing sins.&quot; Philip Jacob Spener, Pia Desideria, Allen

              something of the darkness of their age still clings, can and may 
              easily be esteemed too highly. . .&quot; p. 112. </p>

            <p>46&quot;In evaluating Spener and his work it has been customary 
              to emphasize that he was primarily a reformer of Christian life, 
              not a reformer of Christian thought, that his proper place is in 
              the history of Christian piety rather than in the history of Christian 
              doctrine.&quot; Theodore G. Tappert, &quot;Introduction to Pia Desideria&quot;, 
              p. 24-25. </p>
            <p>47&quot;. . .with Spener the reform party within seventeenth century 
              Lutheranism had moved from sincere but indiscriminate criticism 
              to a plan of action.&quot; Ernst Stoeffler, The Rise of Evangelical 
              Pietism, p. 235. </p>
            <p>48L. Berkhof, Systematic Theology, (Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans

              interpretation of the day. </p>

              Pres, 1983) p. 54. Spener's citation of Heb. 5:4 seems especially 
              strange, since he had just rejected the Old Testament concept of 
              priest as applying to the church. See questions #24 and #5 where 
              he affirms that new birth is the sole criteria for priesthood. </p>

            <p>64Philip Jacob Spener, Pia Desideria, Allen C. Deeter, trans. Bk. 
              II p. 72. See also, p. 73, &quot;all christians are called to spiritual 
              offices, even though not to the public performance of the duties 
              of these offices, which belong to the ordained members of these 
              same rightly ordered congregations,&quot; (emphasis mine). </p>
            <p>65This distinction also arose in connection with the teaching activity 
              of women. In Philip Jacob Spener, &quot;The Spiritual Priesthood,&quot; 
              in Peter C. Erb, ed. Pietists: Selected Writings, p. 62, we read, 
              &quot;But are women not forbidden to teach? Yes, namely in the public 
              congregation. But that it is permitted to them outside of the public 
              congregation is clear from the passages and apostolic examples cited 
              (I Cor. 14:34; I Tim. 2:11,12).&quot; This he could argue with more 
              plausibility from the scriptures cited. However he makes no effort 
              to harmonize I Cor. 14:34 with I Cor. 11:5 which must refer to public 
              prayer and prophecy in context. </p>
            <p>66Francke (Spener's disciple) even more strongly rejected the distinction 
              between clergy and laity &quot;`What horrid Mischief this wicked 
              distinction is the cause of.. . .' Both of these leaders, however, 
              avoided a Quaker stance and maintained a functional distinction 
              between clergy and laity.&quot; Dale Brown, Understanding Pietism,

            <p>69Philip Jacob Spener, Pia Desideria, Theodore G. Tappert, trans. 
              p. 63. Brown says, &quot;Spener and Francke defended infant baptism 
              with all of the traditional arguments, In this they held to the 
              objective efficacy of the sacrament.&quot; Dale Brown, Understanding 
              Pietism, (Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1978) p. 
              48. </p>

              p. 63. </p>
            <p>71&quot;Opus Operatum is a term used by Roman Catholics with reference 
              to the sacraments to express their doctrine that the Sacraments 
              confer grace by the `working of the worker' (opere operato) that 
              is, by the performance of the outward sacramental act, apart from 
              the spiritual condition of the recipient (opere operantis). The 
              Council of Trent states plainly: `If any one saith that by the said 
              Sacraments of the New Law grace is not conferred through the act

            <p>76He complains that since there are such problems in the nobility 
              and the clergy, &quot;which ought to govern the masses and lead 
              them to godliness, it is easy to guess how things are in the third

            <p>79So, Stoeffler, &quot;Even if Lutheranism had developed a concept 
              of church discipline such as Calvinism, which it did not, effective 
              discipline would have been difficult under these conditions.&quot;

            <p>80&quot;Francke shared with Spener the conviction that the elders 
              of each congregation should join the pastor in disciplining the 
              congregation, a practice which they admired in Calvinistic churches.&quot;

              who turned out to be a theosophist when his private works were published 
              posthumously. He was therefore completely discredited in the minds 
              of orthodox Lutherans, and his name was a synonym for mystical heresy.

            <p>Quakers were likewise a symbol of religious extremism in Germany 
              at this time. They were widely believed to be guilty of &quot;enthusiasm&quot; 
              which means that they thought God was speaking directly to them.

            <p>91It is also possible that individuals who feel resistant to visible 
              authority gravitate toward a mystical perspective. Of course, both 
              of these possibilities could be true at once. Steven E. Ozment,

            <p>93For instance he argues that Tauler Kempis and German Theology 
              should be introduced into seminary to a greater degree in Philip 
              Jacob Spener, Pia Desideria, Allen C. Deeter, trans. Bk. II p. 93,94. 
              Spener believed that he was following the lead of Luther in this 
              position. On the strong impact of the mystics on Luther's theology 
              see Ernst Stoeffler, The Rise of Evangelical Pietism, p. 191,192

              in the fact that he initiated it.. . .This is the light in which 
              Spener always regarded him.&quot; p. 211. He claims that the main 
              reason Arndt is not recognized as the father of Lutheran Pietism 
              is the fact that he did not start conventicles. p. 203. </p>

              scents a departure from Lutheranism in his [Arndt's] adoption of 
              medieval mystical elements, but his contemporary opponents were 
              more concerned with traces of `enthusiasm.'&quot; p. 54. Interestingly, 
              Arndt could with some justification be called a Weigelian because 
              one of the chapters in his Vom wahren Christenthum (section 34 of 
              Book II) was seen to be from Valentin Weigel, when the latter's

              ed. Pietists: Selected Writings, p. 84. &quot;resignation&quot; 
              for Spener seems to be exactly parallel to the notion of &quot;surrender&quot; 
              so familiar to modern evangelicals, as well as late medieval mystics. 
              The disturbing implication of passivity need not be a problem, because

            <p>143Indeed, Deeter cites evidence that Spener had read &quot;as

            <p>144With regard to ecclesiology, the anabaptist movement had many 
              who argued in a similar vein. </p>
            <p>145Ensign is the author who argues this case most strongly. Yet 
              he is not entirely convincing. The elements he mentions as belonging 
              to Boehmism include;<br>
              &quot;The Christian is to have no sect. . .&quot; (19) This could 
              also have come from an idealistic reading of many passages in the 
              Bible (Eph. 4:3ff). There are certainly many modern theologians 
              who have this view without reference to Boehme.<br>
              &quot;Predestination to damnation was a blasphemous idea,&quot; 
              (20) but Spener and many others (such as the Quakers) thought the 
              same thing.<br>
              &quot;One must `put on Christ' and experience the `process' of the 
              incarnation within one's self,&quot; (20) but it is sometimes a 
              fine line between this language and Pauline notions of identification 
              with Christ (II Cor. 4:7-18). The process idea is also typical of 
              other German mystics. Lordship theology was typical of all pietists.<br>
              &quot;Sophia mysticism,&quot; Ensign admits is &quot;a variation 
              on the typical medieval love-phantasy theme, based on the Song of 
              Solomon.&quot; (20,21) Indeed this theme was very common in the 
              medieval period, as well as after the reformation (see &quot;Other 
              Arndtians&quot; below). Besides, Ensign admits, &quot;some [radical 
              pietists] abstained from either of these sentimental cults,&quot; 
              (21).<br>
              &quot;Celibacy as a spiritually more desirable state than marriage,&quot; 
              (21) but this was hardly new with Boehme. One need never have heard 
              of Boehme to have this view, which had dominated the middle ages, 
              and is clearly evident in the earliest monastic writers. <br>
              &quot;Religion should not be controlled in any way by the state,&quot; 
              (21) but this was the automatic cry of all those who were being 
              persecuted by the state for Religion.<br>
              Finally, Ensign not only admits, &quot;Other origins may be found 
              for many, if not most, of these ideas. . .Boehme himself was a part 
              of the mystical-spiritualist tradition.&quot; p. 21, but also &quot;They 
              [the radical pietists] did not consider themselves Boehmists as 
              such in most instances,&quot; and &quot;Writers presenting Boehme's 
              ideas rarely acknowledged their dependence on him.&quot; p. 21. 
              <br>
              One must ask at this point whether sufficient value is left of the 
              theory when it is so qualified that virtually nothing remains? Unless 
              there is other material that was not produced, this author remains 
              unconvinced that Boehme is the main source of the radical's theology. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>This is not to say that he was not an influence at all. We know 
              that Gichtel was a Boehmist. He said, &quot;. . .I must acknowledge 
              that [Boehme's] writings gave been to me of more service for the 
              understanding of the Bible than all my University learning.&quot; 
              cited in Rufus M. Jones, Spiritual Reformers in the 16th and 17th 
              Centuries, p. 153. And we can place Gichtel in direct influence 
              of Gottfried Arnold, and probably Hochman. However, does this mean 
              that Arnold's teachings are simply Boehmist? The fact must be reckoned 
              with that virtually all of these ideas were rife in the intellectual 
              climate of Germany at this time, leading this author to feel that 
              Ensign is over-simplifying the issue. Chauncey David Ensign, Radical

            <p>173Dale Brown, Understanding Pietism, p. 58. Brown goes further, 
              pointing out that in spite of their alleged agreement with the Lutheran 
              definition of the church, Pietism tended to shift its stress from 
              the visible to the invisible church. Although, as we have seen, 
              Spener spoke of the Lutheran church as the true church, he did &quot;approach 
              a spiritualistic view of the church in his distinction between true 
              heart Religion and Lutheran formalism, as did Francke in his differentiation 
              between the converted and unconverted. p. 46. </p>

            <p>176Stoeffler adds, &quot;The difficulty here is that Luther by 
              insisting on salvation sola fide and, at the same time, on a rigidly 
              objective interpretation of baptism bequeathed to posterity what 
              comes close to a logical contradiction. The attempt to deal with 
              this contradiction has perennially exercised and often agitated 
              the minds of Lutheran theologians.&quot; Ernst Stoeffler, The Rise

            <p>183According to Gonzalez, the persecution of the anabaptists involved 
              more fatalities in 50 years than the entire persecution of the early 
              church during the two centuries before Constantine. Yet, while the 
              early persecution of the church is known to everyone, this persecution 
              of the Anabaptists, carried out by both Protestants and Catholics, 
              is virtually unknown to laymen today. Justo L. Gonzalez, The Story

              these meetings operated, &quot;I either repeated in summary fashion 
              the sermon held the previous Sunday or repeated from the New Testament 
              a few verses. . .and then the men present discussed these things 
              without contention or disquiet. . . All the people had free access 
              to these exercises, often as many as the place would hold, nevertheless 
              the women were separated from the men so that the latter could not 
              see them. The subject was at all times the text at hand... Until 
              1682 the exercises were established in this way in my house but 
              on advice of the city council and a special conference called by 
              the rulers they were moved to the church, although to be truthful, 
              not without detriment. . .&quot; From Spener's Selbstbiographie,

            <p>189The leader of the faction that began to skip communion and church 
              was Spener's own friend Johann Jakob Schutz. Spener tried to talk 
              them into returning, while keeping the division quiet, but he was 
              unable. Chauncey David Ensign, Radical German Pietism (c.1675 --

              considered it the normal way of salvation. Franke believed that

              Peter C. Erb, ed. Pietists: Selected Writings, p. 53. Stoeffler 
              thinks that the missionary zeal of the Pietists was related to their 
              idealism. &quot;Related to this religious idealism of the Pietist 
              was also his profound interest in the evangelistic and missionary 
              outreach, which had been largely left out of account by other representatives

              Christians, based on Rom. 11. This is significant because it shows 
              that he rejected the view that the church had supplanted Israel

              Theology. Elwell, Walter A. ed. p. 857, 858. Noll thinks that Pietism 
              was &quot;in one sense the Christian answer to. . .`the discovery 
              of the individual' by providing a Christian form to the individualism 
              and practical-mindedness of a Europe in transition to modern times. 
              . .Both the Enlightenment and Pietism asserted the rights of individuals, 
              opposed the protestant hierarchy, and were concerned about practice 
              more than theory. The question remains as to whether Pietism paved 
              the way for a similar secular expression of these themes.&quot; 
              p. 858. This observation deserves consideration, but may be superficial. 
              The points of contact could be coincidental, and do not necessarily 
              stem from the same basis. On the other hand, once individualism 
              took root, it would not be impossible for it to become a habit, 
              even though the reason changes. </p>
            <p>239These include Karl Barth, Ernst Troeltsch, Paul Tillich, Rienhold 
              Niebuhr, and Emil Brunner. All argue that Pietism tended to lead 
              to individualistic subjectivism, and lack of concern for social 
              conditions because the inner life was focused on exclusive of the 
              outer life. See Ernst Stoeffler, The Rise of Evangelical Pietism,

<p><big>3The importance attached to this link can be seen in the comment of a later
Presbyterian historian, C.H. Strong, &quot;. . . if it be true that this once fearfully
persecuted people is the true connecting link between the Apostolic Church and the
Protestant Reformation, then our interest in their history must be greatly hightened. With
this view of their antiquity there could scarcely be an incident concerning them that
would not be magnified into something of importance.&quot; C.H. Strong, <em>A Brief Sketch

Lyons, in Dauphiny, 1 January, 1618. Cited in Alexis Muston, D.D., <em>The History of the
Waldenses Vol. II</em>, p. 398.</big></p>

<p><big>5&quot;In the 'Acts of the Synods of Dauphiny' (held at Grenoble in 1602) we read,
that the pastors of the Embrunois and of the Val Cluson (which was then included in
Dauphiny) were requested to collect &quot;all sorts of documents bearing on the history of
the life, doctrine, and persecutions of the Albigeois and the Vaudois.&quot; Alexis
Muston, D.D., <em>The History of the Waldenses Vol. II</em>, p. 398.</big></p>

<p><big>6 <em>The Waldenses</em>, (Presbyterian Board of Publication and Sabbath-School
Work, 1912) p. 31 The MSS were given to Sir Samuel Moreland, who also wrote history on
them. Both of these authors are roundly refuted by Pius Melia, D.D., The Origin,
Persecutions, and Doctrines of the Waldenses, (London: James Toovery, 1870).</big></p>

<p><big>7See below, &quot;Doctrine Before the Reformation.&quot;</big></p>

<p><big>8 Muston says of Perrin, &quot;Not only did Perrin fail to make proper use of his
rich materials, but he has even been accused of having employed them unfaithfully,&quot;
and of Leger, &quot;Leger is the most diffuse, and one of the most superficial of all our
historians. He owes his importance partly to the epoch in which he wrote, and to the
imposing form of his work. He is often incorrect, credulous, and carried away by his
feeling; but the latter fault was almost inevitable in a contemporary author, himself the
victim of the events which he records. Alexis Muston, D.D., <em>The History of the
Waldenses Vol. II</em>, 399,402.</big></p>

<p><big>9C.H. Strong, <em>A Brief Sketch of the Waldenses, and The Waldenses</em>,
(Presbyterian Board of Publication and Sabbath-School Work, 1912) p. 29 explains the lack
of documentation at several points saying, &quot;The Waldenses complain, that it has been
the cruel policy of their persecutors to destroy all the historical memorials of their
antiquity.&quot;</big></p>

<p><big>10Pius Melia, D.D., <em>The Origin, Persecutions, and Doctrines of the Waldenses</em>,
pp.59-85. &quot;That the principal reason for which the Waldenses were punished in
Piedmont was not precisely their religious belief, but their having been rebellious
against the orders of the Sovereign and the laws of the country in which they lived. .
.&quot; He goes on to point out that they had killed an officer of the inquisition in the
neighborhood, without speculation as to why they would want to attack a friendly
inquisitor (p. 83). </big></p>

<p><big><a name="11">11</a>Giorgio Tourn, <em>The Waldensians</em> is a good history,
written from a friendly but fair point of view. This source takes cognizance of all of the
critical findings that I have been able to locate. Tourn seems to be very judicious in his
use of the sources, rejecting Waldensian legends, even though he is a Waldensian pastor.
He should however, be criticized for down-playing the influence of dualistic asceticism on
Waldensian doctrine, and perhaps for the use of one source that did not appear in other
literature. </big></p>

<p><big>12The Chronicler was Richard, Monk of Cluny, &quot;Rerum Italicarum

<p><big>15This translation was done by priests in Lyons, Bernard Ydros, and Steven de Ansa
who were paid for their work by Waldo. F. Steven de Bellavilla, &quot;Scriptores Ordinum
Praedicatorum,&quot; reproduced with translation in Pius Melia, D.D., <em>The Origin,
Persecutions, and Doctrines of the Waldenses</em>, pp. 9-14. This source says he had met
several times the later translator. Writing in the early 1200's, he would be considered a
good source. He describes the excommunication of the Waldensians, and their practice of
changing disguises frequently (from cobbler to merchant etc.) as they traveled around, to
avoid detection.</big></p>

<p><big>16This short description by Mapes &quot;De Nugis Curialium,&quot; one of the
earliest reference to the Waldensians, is among the manuscripts of the Bodleian Library
(851) at Oxford. Mapes goes on to relate that they were forbidden to teach, and concludes,
&quot;Naked, they follow a naked Christ. Their beginnings are humble in the extreme, for
they have not yet much of a following, but if we should leave them to their devices they
will end by turning all of us out.&quot; Partially reproduced in Giorgio Tourn, <em>The
Waldensians</em> p. 14.</big></p>

<p><big>17This is an example of what was called &quot;ignorance&quot; and
&quot;illiteracy&quot; by Mapes. </big></p>

<p><big>18&quot;Direct personal experience of God and its propagation through preaching,
unless adapted to the sacramental life of the church, constituted [a] . . .greater threat:
for, carried to its conclusion, it meant nothing less than entirely renouncing the
arbitrament of the church and denying its raison d'etra as the expression of God's saving
will on earth.&quot; Jeffrey B. Russell ed., <em>Religious Dissent in the Middle Ages</em>,

<p><big>20Note the inconsistency in the claim that they were illiterate, yet they
translated the Bible and other books &quot;in common speech&quot;. While many no doubt
were illiterate, it is likely that for others, their illiteracy consisted of inability to
read languages other than Provencal. </big></p>

<p><big>For an example of the logic used to reject their right to preach, see F. Moneta,

Waldenses, Libri quinque&quot;, (Rome: Thomas Augustin Ricchini, 1743) original with

<p><big>22For instance, the Cathari were widely believed to have been influenced by
Manichaen doctrine, denied by many today. However, they probably were influenced by the
Paulicians and the Bogomils, who were from the Balkan region. So, Kenneth Scott
Latourette, <em>A History of Christianity Volume I: to A.D. 1500</em>, (New York: Harper
&amp; Row Publishers, 1975) p. 454. Latourette says, &quot;The Cathari were but one
expression of the religious ferment, chiefly Christian in its forms, which profoundly
moved the Latin South of Europe in these centuries.&quot; p. 453.</big></p>

<p><big>24Quoted in Emilio Comba, D.D., <em>History of the Waldenses of Italy</em>,
(London: Truslove &amp; Shirley, 1889), p. 16 He adds, &quot;It seemed indeed as if the
foundations of the Church were being upheaved; storms of ideas and lurid lights were
arising on all sides. . .These were intermingled with new interpretations of the Gospel
which were audaciously progressive, and with opinions, which on the contrary, sought
refuge in primitive Christian tradition against the innovations of Rome.&quot; Comba,
although he is a Waldensian pastor, rejects the antiquity of the Waldensians.</big></p>

<p><big>35Biller identifies distinct orders of &quot;brothers&quot; and
&quot;sisters&quot; in the later fifteenth century Waldensians who like the Barba,
traveled and preached for at least part of their careers (there may have been a later
contemplative phase for the older brothers). Biller shows that the rite of entry to the
brotherhood included the &quot;profession of the three monastic vows. . .greater
strictness [than other mendicant orders] . . .a requirement of virginity, not just
celibacy in a candidate, automatic expulsion for a sexual lapse, a longer period of
probation after profession of vows, twelve years in one case. . .&quot; Peter Biller,

Hermits and the Ascetic Tradition: Papers read at the 1984 Summer Meeting and the 1985

<p><big>36See a concise analysis of Asceticism based on the writings of Augustine in Henry
Chadwick, &quot;The Ascetic Ideal in the History of the Church,&quot; in <em>Monks Hermits
and the Ascetic Tradition</em>, pp. 1-23. This period was formative for the history of
asceticism in the church, because the overwhelming influx of so-called
&quot;converts&quot; after Constantine was threatening to erase the distinction between
Christian and pagan. In the face of social pressure to become Christian, millions were
joining the church without having been converted. Thus, in addition to the dualistic
reasons for asceticism (suspicion of the material world) there was the effort to put
distance between one's self and the nominal Christians (see pp. 8-9).</big></p>

<p><big>40Although Pius Melia claims that, &quot;It is therefore beyond doubt that, before
the time of Luther and Calvin, the Waldenses admitted all the books of the [Catholic]
Bible. . .&quot; (e.g. including the Apocrapha) the only evidence he gives is the presence
of two portions of apocryphal books in translation in the Cambridge collection of
Waldensians mss. Pius Melia, D. D., <em>The Origin, Persecutions, and Doctrines of the
Waldenses</em>, p. 93,98. However, this conclusion seems unwarranted. The Waldensians
definitely rejected the existence of purgatory during the early period, and claimed that
it was foreign to the scriptures. Yet this doctrine is clearly rooted in the Apocraphal
literature.&nbsp; They also argued that there was nothing anyone could do once a person
died, as can be seen from the following early record of the Inquisition.</big></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><big>&quot;. . .one who does good will go to paradise, and one who does evil will go to
    hell and damnation; purgatory does not exist. Indeed, whoever believes in purgatory is
    condemned already. Further, charities after one's death should not be done, for charities
    after death have no value; that they do not profit the one who does them if they are not
    done before death. . .&quot; &quot;Interrogation of Filippo Regis&quot; at his trial in
    1451, published by G. Weitzecker, <em>Processo di un valdese nell'anno 1451, in Rivista
    Cristiana IX</em> (1881) pp. 363-67, Partially reproduced in translation in Giorgio Tourn,
    <em>The Waldensians</em>, pp. 55,56.</big></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><big>These views would be impossible to argue if the book of II Maccabees was viewed as
canonical. There is no statement in any Waldensian writing affirming the cannonicity of
the Apocrapha. These books, like the writings of the fathers (which are also found in
Waldensian translation) were apparently used as supplemental material, as indeed they were
so viewed by most of the Roman Catholic Church during this period. </big></p>

<p><big><a name="41">41</a>The established orders of monasteries were obtaining great
wealth during this period. See Bainton's insight that when reaching new areas during a
time when currency was worthless, only a self-supporting monastery was in a position to
survive. Later, as land was donated, the serfs were donated along with it. The monks would
accept the serfs, and so became land major lords. &quot;Altogether they were the most
enterprising businessmen of their day.&quot; Roland Bainton, &quot;The Ministry in the
Middle Ages,&quot; in <em>The Ministry In Historical Perspective</em>, H. Richard Niebuhr
and Daniel D. Willians, Editors, (New York: Harper &amp; Brothers Publishers, 1956) pp.
86,87.</big></p>

<p><big>42Giorgio Tourn, <em>The Waldensians</em>, p. 6,21,39.</big></p>

<p><big>43By the end of the 15th century Biller is able to describe the Waldensian
&quot;brothers&quot; as giving, &quot;. . .a two dimensional picture of the asceticism of
a strict and clandestine mendicant Order.&quot; Yet one has to remember that this was
almost 300 years after the movement had begun. One only has to compare the church in 350
AD to the church in Acts to realize how much things may have changed in such a long
period. Peter Biller, &quot;Multum Ieiunantes et se Castigantes: Medieval Waldensian
Asceticism&quot; in <em>Monks, Hermits and the Ascetic Tradition</em>, p. 223. When taking
confession, &quot;their penance was heavier than that imposed by the priests in the
Church.&quot; For instance, they demanded &quot;fasting one or two days a week for a year
or several years&quot; for excessive love-making with one's wife or husband (p. 226). </big></p>

<p><big>44The reason for the rejection of Waldo is given as his ignorance. Yet, Francis
was not rejected. Of course, there were different popes involved, and the church had the
experience of the Waldensians to reflect on at the time of Francis. I think the only
visible difference of importance was the fact that Waldo had the Bible translated.
Therefore, when the Poor of Lyons preached, it was with a Bible in their hands in the
vernacular. This was probably a level of authority too threatening to tolerate.</big></p>

Translation</em>, (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1980) p. 140.</big></p>

<p><big>46In the year 1180, Henri de Marcy, the Pontifical Delegate, was in southern
France to organize a campaign against the Cathari, and there encountered Waldo. He called
on Waldo to sign a statement of adherence to the Roman Catholic faith, and without
hesitation he did so. Giorgio Tourn, <em>The Waldensians</em>, p. 11.</big></p>

<p><big>50Melia says, &quot;The Waldenses were condemned, in fact, by Pope Lucius III., at
a Council held in Verona, in the presence of many Bishops and of the Emperor Frederick, in
the year 1184, with these words: 'By Apostolical Authority, and by means of this
Constitution, we do condemn every heresy, whatever name it bears, and principally the
Catharites and the Patherines, and those who, with a wrong name, call themselves, with
Deception, the Humbled or the Poor of Lyons.'&quot; Pius Melia, D.D., <em>The Origin,
Persecutions, and Doctrines of the Waldenses</em>, p. 16. Likewise, Margaret Deansly, <em>A
History of the Medieval Church 590-1500 </em>(London: Methuen &amp; Co. Ltd., 1972) p.
221. But Tourn says that this was only a prohibition of their preaching. He says that they
were not definitively condemned for heresy until the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215.
Giorgio Tourn, <em>The Waldensians</em>, p. 232. </big></p>

<p><big><a name="51">51</a>The reason given was &quot;obstinacy.&quot; Giorgio Tourn, <em>The
Waldensians</em>, p. 12. </big></p>

<p><big>52Giorgio Tourn, <em>The Waldensians</em>, p. 12. See also Deansly,
&quot;&quot;Margaret Deansly, <em>A History of the Medieval Church 590-1500, </em>p. 221</big></p>

<p><big>53Kenneth Scott Latourette, <em>A History of Christianity Volume I: to A.D. 1500</em>,
p. 452. Tourn adds that the Waldensians struck a chord with the tone of northern Italian
piety. The Pateria were very receptive to the Waldensians in this region. They also met
some of the followers of Arnold of Brescia, the disciple of Abelard, who had travelled all
over Europe making the acquaintance of various dissident groups and had even started a
popular movement in Rome. It was Arnold who first advanced the notion of a complete
separation between religious and political powers.&quot; Giorgio Tourn, <em>The
Waldensians</em>, pp. 15,16. It is in the addition of the North Italian dissidents that
the Waldensians could claim some pre-existence. There had been resistance to Papal claims
in this area for some time, but it was not based on evangelical doctrine, as some
protestant writers assert.</big></p>

<p><big>54This tenet led to added persecution in a day when fealty oaths were the basis of
society. The Waldensians were outside the law, because they refused to swear allegiance to
anyone. Some Inquisitors claimed that they were allowed to swear a limited number of oaths
under torture in order to save themselves and others. Bernard Gui, &quot;Manuel de
l'Inquisiteur&quot;, in Jeffrey Burton Russell, <em>Religious Dissent in the Middle Ages</em>,
pp. 51,52.</big></p>

<p><big>55Pius Melia, D.D., <em>The Origin, Persecutions, and Doctrines of the Waldenses</em>,
pp. 101-129. This section of Melia's book has been copied for viewing at Xenos Fellowship
office. It not only cites several original Waldensian and inquisitorial documents for each
point in the original and in translation, but in addition, each doctrine mentioned is
answered from the Roman Catholic point of view. Melia cites the scriptural and &quot;de
fide&quot; documents with references that set forth the Roman Catholic position on each
point. Such a defense is unusual and hard to find, especially in such condensed form.</big></p>

<p><big>56According to Tourn, &quot;. . .in Waldensian thinking one cardinal point had
stood out from the beginning: an insistence on a clear separation between the civil power
and the exercise of religion. . .&quot; Giorgio Tourn, <em>The Waldensians</em>, p. 70.
This idea seems to also underlie numerous claims by inquisitors that the Waldensians
rejected the authority of all earthly princes. It is likely that they were actually
rejecting the right of secular rulers to lead pogroms supposedly based on religion. </big></p>

<p><big>57A typical witness to this view is Raymond de Costa's description of a Waldensian
eucharist, </big><br>
<big>&quot;. . .bless, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, this bread, this
fish, [a distinctive Waldensians addition] and this wine, not as a sacrifice and offering,
but as a simple commemoration of the most holy supper which Jesus Christ our Lord
instituted. . .,&quot; From the &quot;Testimony of Raymond de Costa at his trial in
1320,&quot; published by J. Duvernoy, <em>Le Registre d'Inquisition de Jacques Fournier</em>,
(Toulouse, 1965). partially reproduced in Giorgio Tourn, <em>The Waldensians</em>, p.
41,42. </big></p>

<p><big>58Tourn says, &quot;The fact, for instance, that any true believer could
administer the sacrament of the Lord's Supper indicates that the hierarchical structure of
the Church with its sacerdotal power had been overcome.&quot; Yet it is not clear what
went in its place. Giorgio Tourn, <em>The Waldensians</em>, p. 50, 51. One of the
statements in a document called, &quot;Waldo's statement of Faith&quot;, dated by Tourn
1180 is, &quot;We believe also that anyone in this age who keeps to a proper life, giving
alms and doing other good works from his own possessions and observing the precepts from
the Lord, can be saved.&quot; p. 14. This author was unable to confirm the authenticity of
this source.</big></p>

<p><big>59So also, Jan Milic Lochman, &quot;Not Just One Reformation: The Waldensian and
Hussite Heritage,&quot; in <em>Reformed World</em>, Vol. 33 No. 5 (Mar. 75) p.220.</big></p>

<p><big>60The Cathari were called Albigensians because their main city was Albi in
southern France. </big></p>

<p><big><a name="61">61</a>Giorgio Tourn, <em>The Waldensians</em>, p. 18. Not everyone
agreed with coercion. Genoa and Piacenza, for instance, refused to include in their

<p><big>65The list is too long in some cases. Protestant authors have been accused of
exaggerating the purges, and there are accounts that seem to take morbid delight in the
sins of the Roman Catholic Church at the expense of truth. </big></p>

<p><big>68Giorgio Tourn, <em>The Waldensians</em>, p. 61. He also warns that not all
references to Waldensians are to be believed, &quot;heretical tendencies of every sort
were called `Waldensian.' One remembers that Joan of Arc was condemned for her
'Waldensianism.' In the Index of the Flemish Church, Waldensian meant a mysterious
character, close to the world of witches and sorcerers, worshipers of the devil and
practitioners of black magic. Fascination with this view has rewarded us with verbal
accounts by inquisitors and also some remarkable miniatures by Flemish artists, such as
those picturing Waldensians flying on brooms or participating in the nightly excursions
and dances of witches.&quot; p. 40, 41 He also produces a plate of one of the broom flying
pictures on after p. 46. </big></p>

<p><big>70The practice of calling their leaders &quot;uncles&quot; stemmed from the desire
to literally obey the command in the gospels to &quot;call no man father. . .[or]
teacher&quot; (Mt. 23:8-10), and because the term was deceptive and helped keep secret who
their leaders were. </big></p>

incidents of violence, though few in number. &quot;. . . the Waldensians assassinated the
inquisitors Peter of Verona and Conrad of Marburg; we know also that not a few priests in
Bohemia who were caught up in the repression there came to the same end.&quot;(p. 48).</big></p>

<p><big>76Cameron thinks that this Synod was not an orderly meeting as Tourn suggests, but
a series of discussions between various clusters of Waldensians and Reformed over a period
of time, perhaps punctuated by one major meeting. Unfortunately, based on the documents he
analyses, it is hard to understand his point. He admits that such a meeting did occur, and
that the outcome was as claims, but he refers to it as the &quot;The myth of
Chanforan.&quot; Euan Cameron, <em>The Reformation of the Heretics: The Waldenses of the

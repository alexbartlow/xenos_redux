  <h1 style="text-align:center;">The  Christian Teaching of Substitutionary Atonement</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center;">by Conrad Hilario</p>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><em>&ldquo;What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again;  there is nothing new under the sun.&rdquo;</em></p>
  <p style="text-align:center;">-King Solomon</p>
  <p>Within recent  years a movement has been  &ldquo;emerging&rdquo; within Christianity promising to repaint the Christian faith. The  leaders of this movement depict modern Christianity as a rigid, dusty  orthodoxy, filled with endless dogmas and doctrines. According to their perspective,  true Christianity must be understood as fluid, changing, and being reworked to  throw off the straightjacket of doctrines restricting its modern relevance.  Among these doctrines being reworked is the Christian teaching of  substitutionary atonement &ndash;the belief that Jesus died to pay humanity&rsquo;s moral  debt to God. </p>
  <p>Rob Bell, a prominent leader of this  emerging movement, recently completed his national speaking tour entitled &ldquo;The  Gods Aren&rsquo;t Angry.&rdquo; During his presentation, Bell shares three insights that  form the basis of his talk. According to Bell, his third &ldquo;revelation&rdquo; came in  Jesus. The sacrificial system in Leviticus became corrupt and led people to  believe that God was angry with them. But at just the right time, God revealed  that he never needed their sacrifice. </p>
  <p>The problem, Bell suggests, is not that God  is angry with us, but that we <em>think </em>he is angry with us. While talking  about the sacrificial system, Bell says, &ldquo;the blood was never for God, that was  just to help humans live with, absorb, and trust, the love of a God who keeps  on insisting, trust me.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" class="ftnref">1</a>  Thus, Jesus&rsquo;  did not come to change God&rsquo;s mind about us, but to change our mind about God. His  mission had nothing to do with appeasing God&rsquo;s anger toward humanity; instead,  he came to emancipate us from the slavery of alienation we feel towards him. </p>
  <p> But  there is really nothing new in what Bell is saying. Far from being a fresh take  on the atonement, Bell is recycling a historic view of the atonement called the  &ldquo;moral influence theory.&rdquo; And really, most modern attempts to rework and  repaint the Christian teaching of the atonement are mere reproductions of  someone else&rsquo;s work. </p>
  <p> This  essay, then, is a response to the growing movement within Christianity, which  denies substitutionary atonement. It aims to provide Scripture an opportunity  to speak as the final arbiter in determining the atonement&rsquo;s purpose. It is my  conviction that when Scripture is given a fair hearing, it clearly and  consistently depicts the atonement as a sin-bearing, substitutionary death. </p>
  <p>In what follows, then,  we will begin by sketching three major theories of the atonement. Many of the new  perspectives on the atonement are simply repackaged replicas of one these three  theories. Then, we will survey what Scripture has to say about the atonement. This  will help us to evaluate which of the three theories accords best with  Scripture&rsquo;s portrayal of the atonement. And in  the final section, we will evaluate some of the common objections leveled  against substitutionary atonement.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Major  Theories of the Atonement</p>
  <p><em>Moral-Influence Theory</em></p>
  <p>Peter Abelard was  the first to develop the moral influence theory of the atonement (1079-1142).  His theory was largely a reaction to Anselm&rsquo;s view, widely  held at the time, that the incarnation was  necessary because our sin has offended God&rsquo;s moral dignity. In order  to protect his honor, God required some form of compensation. Conversely,  Abelard emphasized the primacy of God&rsquo;s love. He insisted that Jesus did not  make a sacrificial payment to the Father in order to satisfy his offended  dignity; instead, Jesus demonstrated the full  extent of God&rsquo;s love for the human race. Thus, the primary issue of the  atonement is not to uphold God&rsquo;s honor, but rather to relieve the fear and alienation humans  feel towards God.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" class="ftnref">2</a>  </p>
  <p>At first, Abelard&rsquo;s theory did not receive much support. Many  years later, however, it regained popularity when  other advocates of the theory began to expound it. Most notably, Horace  Bushnell (1802-76) popularized the theory in the United States, while Hastings Rashdall led the way in Great Britain. The remaining  explanation of the moral-influence theory will  be primarily drawn from the work of these men.</p>
  <p> Advocates  of the moral-influence theory stress that God&rsquo;s essential nature is love. They  tend to downplay his other qualities such as his justice, holiness, and  righteousness. Thus, they conclude that humans should not be afraid of God&rsquo;s  punishment. Instead, our problem has to do with our view of God, which prevents  us from turning to him.</p>
  <p> Our  feelings of alienation and estrangement from God present themselves in many  different ways. For instance, we may not realize that  our rebellion and disobedience towards God is a source of pain to God;  or we many not understand that in spite  of all that we have done, God still loves us. And yet, if we would just repent  and turn back to God, there would be reconciliation. The problem does not have  to do with God&rsquo;s ability to forgive. Nothing in his nature requires payment for  our sins. The difficulty is with us.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" class="ftnref">3</a>  Bushnell views sin as a type of sickness from which we must be healed. This,  then, is why Jesus came: to heal us. </p>
  <p>Unlike more  objective theories of the atonement, which view Jesus&rsquo; death as central to the  purpose of his coming, advocates of the moral-influence theory believe that  Jesus came <em>solely</em> as an expression of  God&rsquo;s divine love. His death was merely one aspect  of his love for us. Consequently, Jesus&rsquo; death was an opportunity or a circumstance  to demonstrate his love. As Bushnell explains: &ldquo;[Jesus&rsquo;] sacrifice, taken as a  fact in time, was not set before him as the end, or object of his ministry  &ndash;that would make it a mere pageant of suffering, without rational dignity, or  character &ndash;but, when it came, it was simply the bad fortune such a work,  prosecuted with such devotion, must encounter on its way.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" class="ftnref">4</a>  Far from squaring up the account of our sin or satisfying God&rsquo;s divine justice,  Jesus&rsquo; death was not the <em>central</em> purpose of his coming; it was a <em>consequence</em> of his coming. </p>
  <p>Bushnell sees his  view consistently expressed throughout Scripture. For instance, Jesus&rsquo; mission  can be found in his own words: &ldquo;For the Son of Man came to seek and to save  what was lost&rdquo; (Lk. 19:10). In another place, Paul  tells us: &ldquo;God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:19).  In the parable of the Lost Son (Lk. 15), Jesus tells  the story of a father who longs for his son&rsquo;s return and rejoices when his son  finally comes to his senses and returns home.  Although these passages make use of various expressions and images, they bear  the same common idea: the Father loves us and the sending of Son was an  expression of this. Thus, Jesus&rsquo; death should be seen as accomplishing three  things:</p>
  <p>1<em>. Jesus&rsquo; death was aimed at removing our  fear of God.</em> When we turn to the very first pages of the Bible, we are told  that Adam and Eve had sinned against God. Shortly after this, they felt  estranged from God and tried to hide from him. This, the Bible tells us, is the  natural human response to guilt: avoidance. Brokenhearted over our response,  Jesus entered our situation and died a brutal death. Bushnell powerfully  describes its effect upon us: &ldquo;In a word we see him entered so deeply into our  lot, that we are softened and drawn by him, and even begin to want him entered  more deeply, that we may feel him more constrainingly.  In this way a great point is turned in our recovery. Our heart is engaged  before it is broken. We like the Friend before we love the Savior.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" class="ftnref">5</a>  </p>
  <p>2. <em>Jesus&rsquo; death causes us to feel remorse that  ultimately leads to repentance.</em> According to proponents of the moral  influence theory, we need a profound internal conviction that leads to a  genuine sense of sorrow for turning away from God. This is why Jesus came to  die. When we face what John Stott describes as &ldquo;that lonely, twisted, tortured figure on the cross, nails through hands and  feet, back lacerated, limbs wrenched, brow bleeding from thorn-pricks, mouth  dry and intolerably thirsty, plunged in God-forsaken darkness,&rdquo; only then we  will be softened, only then will we find our resistance to God gone, only then  will we finally turn to Jesus in love.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" class="ftnref">6</a>  </p>
  <p>3. <em>Jesus&rsquo; death gives us inspiration</em>. We  need more than an abstract description of how to live our lives. What we need  is something more practical. According to Bushnell, we don&rsquo;t want theological  definitions of God; instead, &ldquo;we want a friend, whom  we can feel as a man, and whom it will be sufficiently accurate for us to  accept and love.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" class="ftnref">7</a>  Thus, Jesus humanized God, bringing him down to our level. </p>
  <p>To sum up, then,  the moral influence theory emphasizes God&rsquo;s love and mercy over his justice and  holiness. Thus, the atonement is primarily directed towards humanity. Far from  satisfying God&rsquo;s divine justice, Jesus came to untangle the fear and  estrangement that arrests us whenever we try to turn to God. </p>
  <p><em>Ransom Theory</em></p>
  <p>It may be fair to say  that the ransom theory was the standard theory of the  atonement in the early church. Giants of the early church such as Augustine,  Origen and Gregory of Nyssa held this view of the atonement, and  it dominated the church&rsquo;s understanding of the atonement until the time of  Anselm (1033-1109). </p>
  <p>Origen saw  salvation history as a divine drama that was unfolding. In the cosmic struggle  between good and evil, Satan established his control over humanity. And as the  &ldquo;ruler of this world,&rdquo; his rights could not be simply set aside. Thus, the  central problem facing humanity is its enslavement to an unfit ruler,  Satan. </p>
  <p>The primary text  that Origen relied upon in his understanding was Jesus&rsquo;  statement in Mark 10:45: &ldquo;The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to  serve, and to give his life as a <em>ransom</em> for many&rdquo; (emphasis mine). One may very well ask, &ldquo;To whom was this ransom  being paid?&rdquo; Certainly, God did not pay a ransom to himself. So, then, to whom  was Jesus given as a ransom? Origen thought that it was to the evil one, Satan,  who held us captive. </p>
  <p>In Origen&rsquo;s  original formulation of this theory, Satan demanded Jesus&rsquo; blood as a ransom  for the human race. This anticipated the potential charge that God was  dishonest in his dealings with Satan. After all, it was Satan who initiated the  ransom. Far from being deceived by God, Satan actually deceived himself. In the  first place, he <em>wrongly</em> thought that  he could hold Jesus in death. Satan did not anticipate the resurrection. Second,  he released the human race before realizing that he could not hold Jesus in  death.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" class="ftnref">8</a>  </p>
  <p>Nearly a century  later, Gregory of Nyssa elaborated on Origen&rsquo;s  ransom theory. In his formulation, Gregory was concerned to uphold God&rsquo;s  justice. He reasoned that since our captivity was due to our own choice, it  would have been unwarranted for God to take from Satan what was rightfully his.  Thus, an exchange had to take place. Blinded by his pride and greed, Satan  hastily accepted the life of Jesus, God&rsquo;s son, in  exchange for the human race. However, Satan failed to realize that Jesus&rsquo; deity  was enveloped in human flesh.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" class="ftnref">9</a>  God deliberately concealed it from Satan so that he would accept Jesus as a  ransom. Gregory summarizes his view by way of analogy: &ldquo;The Deity was hidden  under the veil of our nature, so that, as with ravenous fish, the hook of the  Deity might be gulped down along with the bait of flesh.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" class="ftnref">10</a>  </p>
  <p>Unflinchingly,  Gregory not only acknowledged God&rsquo;s deception of Satan, he even justified it.  He argued that an act is just if it fulfills two conditions. First, each party  should receive its due. And second, the act should be  motivated by love. Jesus&rsquo; death met both conditions. It was fitting that  deception was used on Satan since he used deception to enslave the human race.  And it was further justified because it was aimed at redeeming the human race. </p>
  <p>In a later  formulation of the ransom theory, Augustine carefully sought to avert the  potential charge that God had been dishonest or unjust.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" class="ftnref">11</a>  He did this by suggesting that God did not actively deceive Satan, he only permitted the deception. Jesus&rsquo; deity had not  been hidden from Satan to trick him. Instead, Satan was the victim of his own  pride. He foolishly thought that he could hold Jesus in death, though he  possessed no such power. Since Jesus was without sin, Satan had no control over  him.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" class="ftnref">12</a>  </p>
  <p>The ransom theory  endured for nearly six centuries as the primary way people understood the  atonement. But with the rise of Anselm and Peter Abelard&rsquo;s theories of the  atonement, the ransom theory fell out of prominence. In recent times, however, Gustaf Aulen has resuscitated it.  He has termed this view the &ldquo;classic view&rdquo; and has maintained that the atonement  primarily centered upon God&rsquo;s triumph.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" class="ftnref">13</a>  </p>
  <p>To sum up this  view, then, the ransom theory suggests that the ultimate purpose of Jesus&rsquo;  death was to liberate the human race from the evil one&rsquo;s bondage. Unlike the  moral influence theory, which views the atonement as aimed primarily at humans,  the ransom theory views the atonement as directed towards Satan. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p><em>Substitution Theory</em></p>
  <p>A final theory of the atonement is commonly  referred to as the substitution or satisfaction theory. This theory suggests  that the primary purpose of Jesus&rsquo; death was to satisfy God&rsquo;s justice.  Thus, the primary force of the atonement was not directed towards restoring  humanity or prevailing over the evil one; instead it served as a payment to God  for wrongdoing committed against him.</p>
  <p>The earliest and  most prominent advocate of this theory was Anselm  (1033-1109), archbishop of Canterbury. Anselm&rsquo;s  lived during a time when violations of law were no longer thought of in a  judicial sense, as they were during the Roman Empire. Instead, he lived in a  feudal society where justice and law were viewed as more of a personal matter.  Breaking the law was thought to be an offense against the person of the feudal  overlord. Immersed in this way of thinking, Anselm  pictured God as a feudal overlord who, in order to preserve his honor, insisted  that adequate reparations be made to compensate for his loss.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" class="ftnref">14</a> </p>
  <p> By way of an apologetic response to his  Muslim critics, Anselm offered his fullest treatment of  substitutionary atonement in <em>Cur Deus  Homo</em> (Or, &ldquo;Why God became man&rdquo;). In it, he attempted to argue that the incarnation and atonement of Jesus were logically necessary.</p>
  <p>Anselm rejected  Gregory&rsquo;s formulation of the ransom theory and even Augustine&rsquo;s modification of  it. His contention with the theory had to do with its central claim that Satan  had a right to possess the human race. According to Anselm, no one has the right  to possess the human race besides God. He believed that we are, by right, God&rsquo;s  possession. Even Satan himself belongs to God. Therefore, God did not have to  purchase humanity from Satan.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" class="ftnref">15</a>  </p>
  <p>Anselm&rsquo;s formulation of the atonement is directly extracted from his view of sin. After  all, as Millard Erickson observes, &ldquo;[W]hat  sin is understood to be will strongly influence one&rsquo;s view of what must be done  to counter it.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" class="ftnref">16</a>  From Anselm&rsquo;s point of view, sin is a failure to give God his due. By  failing to give God his due, we take from  God what is rightfully his, thus dishonoring him. But it is not good enough to  restore what was taken from God. For by taking from him, we have offended him.  And even if what was taken had been returned, God must be further compensated for  the injury committed against him.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" class="ftnref">17</a>  By way of analogy, Erickson clarifies: &ldquo;A good comparison is modern judicial  rulings which stipulate that a thief, in addition to restoring his victim&rsquo;s  property, must pay punitive damages or serve a prison sentence.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" class="ftnref">18</a>  </p>
  <p> As  rightful owner and ruler of the universe, God must act to preserve his honor  and cannot simply overlook an offense. His just character demands that he  punish moral wrongdoing. Nor is it enough for us to simply restore what was  taken from him. As Jonathan Edwards explains, the heinousness of the crime is  determined not only by the nature of the action, but also by the dignity and  worth of the person offended.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" class="ftnref">19</a>  Thus, there must be additional compensation. Otherwise, the unpunished sin  would leave God&rsquo;s whole economy out of order.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" class="ftnref">20</a>  </p>
  <p>Anticipating a  counter argument from his critics, Anselm  confronts the question, &ldquo;Why,  then, did not God simply inflict punishment upon the human race?&rdquo; Attempting to demonstrate the  necessity of the incarnation, Anselm argues  that some humans must be saved to balance out the loss of fallen angels. Since  fallen angels cannot be saved, they must be replaced by an equivalent amount of  humans. Thus, a certain portion of humanity must be restored. <a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" class="ftnref">21</a> </p>
  <p>Naturally, then,  satisfaction must be rendered on their behalf. Even if human beings were to do  their best and happened by chance to accomplish perfection, that would be  nothing more than giving God his due. To illustrate this  point, take the example of Mother Teresa. Most would admit that, morally speaking, their lives do not measure up to Mother  Teresa&rsquo;s. However, imagine for a moment that by some chance you were able to  achieve a moral height surpassing even that of Mother Teresa. You would be  inclined to feel a sense of accomplishment (of course not to the point of being  arrogant about it). However, going even a step further, imagine that by some  extraordinary feat you were able to achieve a  life of perfection. You have abstained from thoughts of moral wrongdoing, let  alone committing them; you have sold all of your possessions and have given the  payment to the poor; and you have escaped your life of comfort and  instead dedicated yourself to serving others. Most of  us, at this point, would suspect that a life like this should merit us some  sort of favor from God. But according to Anselm, this is nothing more than  giving God his due. </p>
  <p>This, then, was  the human predicament: God created us with the expectation  that we would live a life of moral perfection. However, we have failed to do this. Thus, death has come upon us. God saw it necessary  to salvage at least part of the human race, but  in order to accomplish this, some sort of satisfaction needed to take place.  Moreover, for it to be effective, that satisfaction needed  to be greater than simply returning what was due to God.  Therefore, only God could have provided this sort of satisfaction. Yet, if it  was to benefit to humanity, it had to be made by a human being. Thus, the  satisfaction needed to be furnished by someone who was both God and a human  being. Consequently, Anselm argues, the incarnation was a logical necessity. Without  it, there was no possibility of satisfaction, and thus no possibility of  forgiveness.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" class="ftnref">22</a>  </p>
  <p>This is precisely  why Jesus came. Being both God and a sinless human, Jesus is capable of  representing humanity and offering more than what is required of him as a human  being. Thus, Jesus could offer his life to God as a genuine sacrifice for  humanity&rsquo;s sins. The death of the God-man was of infinite value. In fact, for Jesus&rsquo;  body to suffer even the slightest bit of harm would have been a matter of  infinite value.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" class="ftnref">23</a>  </p>
  <p>By way of  contrast, to both the moral influence theory and the ransom theory, the  substitutionary theory of the atonement is focused Godward.  Unlike the former two theories, substitutionary  atonement is directed neither toward humanity nor toward the evil one. Rather, substitutionary atonement sees Jesus&rsquo; Jesus&rsquo;  atonement as <em>primarily</em> aimed at  satisfying God&rsquo;s justice. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Before moving on, it is important  to note that while these are <em>competing</em> theories of the atonement, they are not  entirely <em>incompatible</em>.  Rather, the proponents of each view argue that their particular view of the  atonement is the <em>primary</em> way one  should understand the atonement. Moreover, they would suggest that their view  possesses the explanatory power to make sense of the entire corpus of Scripture  related to the atonement. This, then, sets us off to our next task: finding out  what Scripture says about the atonement. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Scripture  Voices Its View of the Atonement </p>
  <p>At this point, we will briskly  survey the relevant texts of Scripture to construct a biblical view of the  atonement. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Old  Testament </p>
  <p><em>The Book of Job</em></p>
  <p>The ending of Job  seems to allude to substitutionary atonement. Following the climax of the story  &ndash;when God confronts Job for presuming that God had made a mistake and Job  repents for his lack of understanding&ndash; God deals with Job&rsquo;s friends, who in  their folly, have not spoken accurately of  God (42:8). God was angry with them for insisting that Job was being punished  for sins he committed. To  atone for their wrongdoing, God instructed Job&rsquo;s friends to bring their  sacrifices to Job. Further, God tells Job&rsquo;s  friends, &ldquo;My servant Job will pray for you,  and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly&rdquo;  (42:8).</p>
  <p>There are two  details of this story that seem to point to substitutionary atonement. First,  God instructed Job&rsquo;s friends to offer an animal sacrifice as a way to alleviate  God&rsquo;s anger towards them. The implication is obvious: God&rsquo;s anger is satisfied  by a sacrificial death. Secondly, God directed Job&rsquo;s friends to have Job pray  for them. This is because God refused to deal with them due to their  wrongdoing. Instead, he required someone to mediate between him and the guilty  party. It is also interesting that the mediator God chose, Job, was a human being like his  friends. This may suggest that there needed to be some sort of connection, some  point of commonality between the mediator and the guilty party being represented. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p><em>Passover</em></p>
  <p>Another signpost leading us in the direction of Jesus&rsquo;  atoning work is the Old Testament feast of Passover. Right before the final  plague was sent upon Egypt, God instructed each household in Israel to take an  unblemished lamb and slaughter it before twilight. They were told to take the  blood of the lamb and apply it to the doorpost and doorway of their house. That  same night, they were to eat the roasted meat along with bitter herbs and bread  made without yeast, and to do so in haste&mdash;their  cloaks tucked into their belts, their sandals already on their feet, and their staffs in  hand. If all of these instructions were followed carefully, the judgment of the  Lord would &ldquo;pass over&rdquo; their households.  God further instructed those who carefully followed his instructions  and escaped Egypt to continue to celebrate this feast as a lasting ordinance. </p>
  <p>When we turn to  the pages of the New Testament, several references are made suggesting a  connection between the atonement and Passover. Reflecting back on this event,  Paul connects the Passover to Jesus&rsquo; death. Speaking of sin that had  infiltrated the Corinthian church and was spreading, Paul pleads with them: &ldquo;Cleanse  out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened.  For Christ, our <a href="javascript:utilExec(%22jump%7Cres=LLS:1.0.338%7Cart=LLS-AOL:314.0.0%7Chit=::OLA:886.8.0%22);">Passover</a> lamb, has  been sacrificed&rdquo; (1 Cor. 5:7). In the Gospel of John, we are told that  when John the Baptist saw Jesus, he declared, &ldquo;Look, the Lamb of God, who takes  away the sin of the world!&rdquo; (Jn. 1:29), which is most likely a reference to the  Passover lamb.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" class="ftnref">24</a>  </p>
  <p>With this  connection between Jesus&rsquo; atonement and the Passover in place, we have warrant  to interpret the individual elements of the Passover as alluding to the  atonement. First, the Passover lamb was unblemished. This suggested that the  victim needed to be innocent. Second, salvation was by substitution. The only  firstborn males spared were the ones in whose families a  lamb had died instead. Third, the lamb&rsquo;s blood had to be applied to the  doorpost for the family to be rescued. Blood was a sign indicating an innocent  life had been taken and that God&rsquo;s judgment should pass over that household.  And finally, the Judge and Savior are the same person. It was God who both &ldquo;passed through&rdquo; Egypt to judge the firstborn and &ldquo;passed over&rdquo;  Israelite homes to protect them.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" class="ftnref">25</a>  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p><em>Sacrificial System and the Day of Atonement </em></p>
  <p>To further expand  our understanding of the atonement, we now turn to the Old Testament  sacrificial system. Before Jesus&rsquo; death, God commanded the Israelite community  to offer animal sacrifices to compensate for sins they committed.  These sacrifices were necessary not to  deter people from committing further sins  nor to reform their sinful mindsets,  but to atone for sins that deserved to be punished. God&rsquo;s  law, a representation of his character, had been offended; thus God himself had  been offended. And the only way to set things right with God was to offer up  the life of an animal as an act of &ldquo;atonement.&rdquo; Millard Erickson explains the  significance of this word: </p>
  <p>The Hebrew word most commonly used in the Old  Testament for the various types of atonement is &#1468;<em>kaphar</em> and its  derivatives. The word literally means &ldquo;to cover.&rdquo; One was delivered from  punishment by the interposing of something between one&rsquo;s sin and God. God then  saw the atoning sacrifice rather than the sin. The covering of the sin meant  that the penalty no longer had to be exacted from the sinner.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" class="ftnref">26</a>  </p>
  <p>These were the terms of payment God  had specified for sins committed. In short, a  life had to be taken for a life to be spared. </p>
  <p>Apart from the  significance of the word atonement, the actual features of the ceremony are  significant to understanding its intended effect. First of all, the sacrificial  animal had to be spotless. This was to indicate that the animal was an innocent  substitute for the guilty party. When the person presented the animal to the  priest, he was to lay his hands on the animal: &ldquo;He is to lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering,  and it will be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for him&rdquo; (Lev. 1:3-4).  This laying on of hands represented the confession of sins committed and the symbolic transference of guilt to the innocent victim.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" class="ftnref">27</a>  Once the worshipper laid his hands on the animal and killed it,  the priest would apply the animal&rsquo;s blood to the altar, burn some of its flesh,  and lay out whatever was left for the purpose of consumption. This ritual,  Stott observes, &ldquo;was significant symbolism, not meaningless magic.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" class="ftnref">28</a>  </p>
  <p>Of course, the  blood of the animal was central to the significance of the atonement. While  spelling out the prohibition of eating blood to the Israelite community, God  explains its significance in the atonement: &ldquo;For the life of a creature is in  the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the  altar; it is the blood that makes atonement for one&rsquo;s life&rdquo; (Lev. 17:11). Blood  was the symbol of life, and a life needed to be taken in  order for sin to be forgiven. Taking a peek ahead into the New Testament to  corroborate our findings, the author of Hebrews tells us that &ldquo;without the  shedding of blood there is no forgiveness&rdquo; (Heb. 9:22). </p>
  <p>The annual Day of Atonement adds some interesting details to our understanding of  the atonement. The sacrifice on the Day of Atonement was  much like a typical sin offering, except for a  few features. First, only the high priest could perform the sacrifice. Second,  the sacrifice was offered for the entire Israelite community. Third, the blood  was to be sprinkled onto the Holy of Holies, located in the innermost chamber  of the Temple. And finally, two animals were sacrificed. The high priest was  instructed to &ldquo;take two male goats for a sin offering&rdquo; in order to atone for  the sins of the entire Israelite community (Lev. 16:5). One goat was to be  sacrificed and its blood sprinkled in the usual way, while the high priest was  to take the other living goat and lay both of his hands on its head and  &ldquo;confess over it all the wickedness and rebellion of the Israelites&mdash;all their  sins&mdash;and put them on the goat&rsquo;s head&rdquo; (Lev. 16:21). Then  he was to drive the goat away into the desert so that it would &ldquo;carry on itself  all their sins to a solitary place&rdquo; (Lev. 16:22). </p>
  <p>Reflecting back on  this solemn day in the Jewish calendar, the author of Hebrews views the Day of  Atonement as a mere shadow of what would come in  Christ. First, he interprets the High Priest&rsquo;s role in the ritual as symbolic  of Jesus&rsquo; role as the ultimate mediator between God and humans.  Moreover, the author of Hebrews interprets the humanity of the High Priest as a depiction of the incarnation: &ldquo;Therefore  he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a  merciful and faithful <a href="javascript:utilExec(%22jump%7Cres=LLS:1.0.338%7Cart=LLS-AOL:394.0.0%7Chit=::OLA:2315.11.0%22);">high priest</a> in the service of God, to make  propitiation for the sins of the people&rdquo; (Heb. 2:17). </p>
  <p>Second, the author  of Hebrews informs us that the victim offered on the Day of Atonement was  symbolic of the sacrifice Jesus offered for humanity. But there is one major  difference: Jesus was not only the mediator, he was <em>also</em> the sacrifice. Later on in his letter, the author of Hebrews reveals  that he views the identities of  the High Priest and the victim as having been  united in Christ: &ldquo;Unlike the other high priests, he does not need  to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the  sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered  himself&rdquo; (He. 7:27). In the same way that the High Priest made a sacrifice for  the entire Israelite community, Jesus&rsquo; death was for the benefit of the entire  human race. This is why the author of Hebrews is able to  conclude, &ldquo;Christ was sacrificed once to take  away the sins of many people&rdquo; (Heb. 9:28).</p>
  <p>Finally,  the High Priest&rsquo;s entrance on the Day of Atonement into the inner sanctuary , the Holy of Holies, pointed to Jesus&rsquo; ability to enter God&rsquo;s presence. While speaking of the hope we have  in Christ, the author of Hebrews says, &ldquo;It [our hope] enters the inner  sanctuary behind the curtain, where Jesus, who went before us, has  entered on our behalf.&rdquo; Of course, the author of Hebrews is not talking about  the <em>literal</em> inner sanctuary, the Holy  of Holies in the Temple. He is referring to the <em>actual</em> throne room of God, for which the Holy of Holies stood  as a copy: &ldquo;For Christ did not enter a man-made sanctuary that was  only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in  God&rsquo;s presence&rdquo; (Heb. 9:24).</p>
  <p></p>
  <p><em>Looking Forward to A More Permanent Solution to Sin</em></p>
  <p>At a later time in  Israel&rsquo;s history, God reveals the provisional nature of the Old Testament  sacrificial system. There we are told to anticipate a more  permanent solution to humanity&rsquo;s sin problem. </p>
  <p>Written in the  wake of his murderous affair with Bathsheba, David&rsquo;s famous Psalm of repentance  describes the inadequacy of burnt offerings: &ldquo;You do not delight in sacrifice,  or I would bring it; you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings. The  sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart&rdquo; (Ps. 51:16-17).  This is one of the first passages in the Old Testament to indicate the  insufficiency of the sacrificial system. </p>
  <p>With the immanent  ruin of Israel in view, Isaiah receives a vision from God regarding its future  deliverance. At the outset of Isaiah&rsquo;s vision, God speaks of his displeasure with  Israel&rsquo;s animal sacrifices: &ldquo;The multitude of your sacrifices&mdash;what  are they to me?&rdquo; says the Lord. &ldquo;I  have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened  animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats&rdquo;  (Isa. 1:11). At this point in Israel&rsquo;s history, God was fed up with the  people&rsquo;s outward religious observance. They were simply going through the  motions. And from God&rsquo;s point of view, burnt offerings were no longer effective  to atone for sin. The author of Hebrews explains: </p>
  <p>The law is only a shadow of the good things that are  coming&mdash;not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same  sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near  to worship&hellip;But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins, because it is  impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. Therefore, when  Christ came into the world, he said: &ldquo;Sacrifice and offering you did not  desire, but a body you prepared for me; with burnt offerings and sin offerings  you were not pleased (10:1-6).</p>
  <p>The sacrificial system was merely a shadow, a symbol  of God&rsquo;s ultimate solution to humanity&rsquo;s sin  problem. </p>
  <p>Looking  again at the book of Isaiah, God begins to uncover his plan to  provide a permanent solution to humanity&rsquo;s sin problem. Near the end of  Isaiah&rsquo;s vision, we encounter a shadowy figure, the  &ldquo;Servant of the Lord.&rdquo; The most noteworthy description of this servant is in  chapter 53. Following a dramatic description of the type of torture and  eventual death the servant will face, Isaiah indicates the purpose of this  servant&rsquo;s appearance: &ldquo;We all, like sheep,  have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way; and the Lord has laid on [the servant] the  iniquity of us all&rdquo; (v. 6). Again in verse 12 we are told, &ldquo;[H]e  bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.&rdquo; This suffering  servant was to take upon himself the sins of the human race, in the same way  the sins of a worshipper were transferred onto an innocent animal in a sin offering or the Atonement offering. </p>
  <p>Of all the passages in the  Old Testament, none is more consistently applied to  Jesus by the New Testament authors than  Isaiah 53. &ldquo;No other passage from the Old Testament, Joachim Jeremias observes, &ldquo;was as important to the Church as  Isaiah 53.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" class="ftnref">29</a>  The New Testament writers quote eight specific verses in Isaiah 53 as having  been fulfilled by Jesus.<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" class="ftnref">30</a>  Isaiah 53:1 (&ldquo;Who has believed our message&rdquo;) is applied to Jesus by John in  John 12:38. Matthew sees Isaiah 53:4 (&ldquo;Surely he took up our infirmities and  carried our diseases&rdquo;) as a fulfillment of Jesus&rsquo; healing ministry (Matt.  8:17). First Peter 2:22-25 contains extensive quotations from Isaiah 53. Peter directly quotes Isaiah 53:9 (&ldquo;He committed no sin, and no  deceit was found in his mouth&rdquo;) as being fulfilled by Jesus (1 Pet. 2:22). In  the same passage, he acknowledges that we, like sheep, have gone astray (Isa.  53:6), but that by Jesus&rsquo; wounds we have been healed (Isa. 53:7). He also  echoes Isaiah 53:11 (&ldquo;he will bear their iniquities&rdquo;) as the reason we can die to sin and live for righteousness (1 Pet. 2:24). And finally,  Phillip found the Ethiopian eunuch reading Isaiah 53:7-8 &ndash;a description of the  servant being led like a sheep to the slaughter and having his justice and life  taken away&ndash; right before telling him the good news about Jesus (Acts 8:30-35). Additionally,  there are dozens of allusions throughout the New Testament that  connect Jesus to the suffering servant of Isaiah 53.<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" class="ftnref">31</a>  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The New Testament</p>
  <p><em>The Writings of Paul</em></p>
  <p>We now turn our attention  to the New Testament to gather more detailed information about the atonement. The  early Pauline epistles provide us with a rich collection of  teaching on the atonement. </p>
  <p>Paul frequently thought of  and referred to Jesus&rsquo; death as a sacrifice. In Galatians 3:13, Paul makes a  stunning statement about Jesus&rsquo; death: &ldquo;Christ redeemed us from the curse of  the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: &lsquo;Cursed is everyone who  is hung on a tree&rsquo;&rdquo; (Gal. 3:13). Echoing this  language, Peter says, &ldquo;He himself bore our sins in his body on the  tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds  you have been healed&rdquo; (1 Pet. 2:25). In both cases, Paul&rsquo;s and Peter&rsquo;s references to the &ldquo;tree&rdquo; are connected to Old Testament  instructions regarding the body of a man hanged for a capital offense.  Deuteronomy 21:22-23 prohibits the body of such a man  to be left hanging on the tree overnight, and commands  the body to be buried on the same day &ldquo;because anyone who is  hung on a tree is under God&rsquo;s curse.&rdquo; The apostles were familiar with this  legislation and with its implication that Jesus died under the divine curse. Of  course, they did not think that Jesus deserved to be cursed by God in any way.  Therefore, they must have understood this to mean that it was our curse that  Jesus was bearing. Further clarifying this conclusion, Paul tells the  Corinthians: &ldquo;God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we  might become the righteousness of God.&rdquo; Again, Paul is not suggesting that our  moral qualities were transferred onto Christ. Instead, the legal consequences of our sin were transferred: Jesus voluntarily accepted liability  for our sins.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" class="ftnref">32</a>  </p>
  <p>Another  indication that Paul viewed Jesus&rsquo; death as sacrificial are the numerous  references he makes to Jesus&rsquo; blood: </p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">For God was  pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, and through him to  reconcile to himself all things&hellip;by making peace through  his blood, shed on the cross (Col. 1:20).</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Since we  have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from  God&rsquo;s wrath through him! (Rom. 5:9).</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">God presented him as a  sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood. (Rom. 3:25). </p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;"></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In him we have redemption through  his blood, the forgiveness of sins. (Eph. 1:7).</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">You who once were far away have been brought near through the  blood of Christ. </p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">(Eph. 2:13). </p>
  <p>In each of these texts, Paul takes Jesus&rsquo; death and  affixes its significance to the Old Testament notion of atonement (Lev. 17:11).  Thus, we see that Paul understood Jesus&rsquo;  blood as an atoning sacrifice for the sins of humanity. </p>
  <p>Finally,  Paul is clear in his writing that Jesus died on our behalf. In Romans 8:32,  Paul tells us that the Father &ldquo;did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us  all&rdquo; (Rom. 8:32). Getting at the motivation behind Jesus&rsquo; arrival and death,  Paul says, &ldquo;God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still  sinners, Christ died for us&rdquo; (Rom. 5:8). Urging  the Ephesians believers to live a life of love, Paul gives them a model for  what this should look like: &ldquo;Live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and  gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.&rdquo; Finally,  Paul tells the Corinthians, &ldquo;For Christ&rsquo;s love compels us, because we are  convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:14). </p>
  <p>Although this is  breathless treatment of Paul&rsquo;s writings, the picture remains clear: he  primarily viewed Jesus&rsquo; death as a substitutionary atonement. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p><em>The Gospels</em></p>
  <p>The Gospel  narratives are littered with information about Jesus&rsquo; atonement. In each of the  Gospels, the surrounding narrative acts like trusses supporting the main stage:  Jesus&rsquo; death. New  Testament scholar Martin Kahler describes the Gospels as &quot;passion narratives with long introductions.&quot;<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" class="ftnref">33</a>  And Jesus makes it clear  throughout the Gospels that he viewed his death as a sin-bearing substitute for humanity. </p>
  <p>Jesus had a  powerful conviction that his life and eventual death were a fulfillment of Old  Testament prophecies. Right before his death on the cross, Jesus told his  disciples: &ldquo;It is written: &lsquo;And he was numbered with the transgressors&rsquo;; and I  tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is  reaching its fulfillment&rdquo; (Lk. 22:37). Jesus here  quotes Isaiah 53:12, the suffering servant passage mentioned  earlier. As Jesus descended the mountain following the transfiguration, he  said, &ldquo;In the same way [like Elijah] the Son of Man is going to suffer at their  hands&rdquo; (Matt. 17:12). In Mark 8:31, Jesus tells his  disciples about his future death: &ldquo;He&hellip;began to teach them that the Son of Man  must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and  teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise  again.&rdquo; This, along with other statements, suggests that Jesus saw his own  death as the primary reason he came. </p>
  <p>More than this,  Jesus saw his future death as a ransom. After turning the disciples&rsquo; view of greatness upon  its head, Jesus said, &ldquo;For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but  to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many&rdquo; (Mk. 10:45). The word &ldquo;ransom,&rdquo; according to Edwin Hatch and Henry Redpath, &ldquo;is used nearly 140 times in the Septuagint,  usually with the thought of deliverance from some sort of bondage in exchange  for the payment of compensation or the offering of a substitute.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" class="ftnref">34</a>  Thus, we may conclude that Jesus saw his life as a ransom, freeing us from the  bondage of sin and death. </p>
  <p>Jesus also saw  himself as our substitute. Towards the end of his  life, Jesus commanded his disciples, &ldquo;Love each other as I have loved you&rdquo; (Jn. 15:12). To  illustrate what this would look like, Jesus said, &ldquo;Greater love has no one than  this, that he lay down his life for his friends&rdquo; (Jn. 15:13). With his  impending death on the cross in sight, there is little doubt that Jesus was  thinking about the substitutionary death he was to undergo.<br>
    There  are other indications that Jesus saw himself as a sacrificial substitute for  the sins of others. While alone in the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus agonized in  prayer to the Father, <em>&ldquo;Abba</em>, Father,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;everything is possible for you. Take this <em>cup</em> from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will&rdquo; (Mk. 14:36,  emphasis added). The &ldquo;cup&rdquo; Jesus was referring to, was an Old Testament symbol  of God&rsquo;s wrath. This is strongly confirmed by the Wisdom  literature and the prophetic writings. In the book of Job, a wicked person was  said to &ldquo;drink of the wrath of the Almighty&rdquo; (Job 21:20). Similarly, God commanded Jeremiah: &ldquo;Take from my hand  this cup filled with the wine of my wrath and make all the nations to whom I  send you drink it&rdquo; (25:15-16). There  is no doubt that Jesus was familiar with this Old Testament imagery.  He must have known that the cup he was being offered contained the wine of  God&rsquo;s wrath. It is clear from his language at  Gethsemane that Jesus recoiled at the thought of  God&rsquo;s wrath being poured out onto him. But Jesus knew that it was God&rsquo;s loving  purpose to save humanity and that the only way this was possible was through  his sin-bearing death. So how could he say, &ldquo;Father,  save me from this hour&rdquo;? &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Jesus said, &ldquo;it was for this  very reason I came.&rdquo; Thus, Jesus steps out of the shadows of Gethsemane,  resolute about his mission. Later that night, when a detachment came to arrest Jesus,  Simon Peter drew his sword to defend Jesus. But Jesus commanded Peter to put it  away, saying, &ldquo;Shall I not drink the cup  the Father has given me? (Jn. 18:11).&rdquo; John&rsquo;s omission of Jesus&rsquo; agonized  prayers at Gethsemane suggests that Jesus knew that the cup would not be taken away from him. He was to drink  the cup of wrath originally reserved for us. </p>
  <p>To sum up, there  is not one discordant voice among the Gospel writers. Together they  speak of Jesus&rsquo; main mission: to die for the sins of the human race. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p><em>General Epistles</em></p>
  <p>In our final  treatment of Scripture, we will evaluate the New Testament writings that do not fall into the two previous categories.  </p>
  <p>Peter views Jesus&rsquo;  death in many of the same categories expressed by other New Testament writers.  Calling on this readers to live as &ldquo;strangers&rdquo;  on the earth in &ldquo;reverent  fear,&rdquo; he reminds them: &ldquo;For you know that  it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were  redeemed&hellip;but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or  defect&rdquo; (1 Pet. 1:18-19). Peter explains the  reason for and value of Jesus&rsquo; death: &ldquo;Christ died for sins once  for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God&rdquo; (1 Pet. 3:18).  Peter very much agrees with the other New Testament writers: Jesus died a  substitutionary death. </p>
  <p>Although we have  already made a number of references to the book of Hebrews, we will cover the  remaining texts in that letter about Jesus&rsquo; atonement.  Set in the context of establishing Jesus&rsquo; divine nature, the author of Hebrews  argues that Jesus is greater than the angels. The  reasoning he provides is, &ldquo;After he had provided purification for sins, he sat  down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven&rdquo; (Heb. 1:3b). The &ldquo;purification  for sins&rdquo; he mentions must be a reference to Jesus&rsquo; death. Evidently, the  author of Hebrews saw Jesus&rsquo; death as an act of purification for sins. Right  after establishing Jesus&rsquo; divine nature, the author of Hebrews argues for Jesus&rsquo; incarnation: &ldquo;Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels,  now crowned with glory and honor&hellip;suffered  death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone&rdquo; (Heb.  2:9). There are two points of interest in this verse. The first is that Jesus  came to earth to &ldquo;taste death for everyone.&rdquo; This points to the fact that  Jesus&rsquo; central mission on earth was to die a substitutionary death. The second  point of interest is that God himself came to earth as Jesus. This implies that  God himself provided Jesus&rsquo; atoning death. Later on in his letter, the author  of Hebrews argues for the supremacy of Jesus&rsquo; sacrificial death over the Old  Testament atonement practice. The  conclusion he draws is, &ldquo;For this reason Christ  is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the  promised eternal inheritance&mdash;now that he has died as a ransom to set them free  from the sins committed under the first covenant&rdquo; (Heb. 9:15). The author of  Hebrews speaks of Jesus&rsquo; death as a ransom, but not in a way that aligns with  the ransom theory&rsquo;s understanding of it. Instead, the author of Hebrews sees  Jesus&rsquo; death as ransom to God, to set humanity free from sins committed. </p>
  <p>Lastly, John&rsquo;s  epistles and Revelation contain some of the clearest statements  in the New Testament about Jesus&rsquo; death. While entreating his  audience to his audience to walk in light, John reasons with them: &ldquo;[I]f  we walk in the light&hellip;we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of  Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin&rdquo; (1 Jn. 1:7). The imagery John uses  here is easily traced back to the Old Testament atonement practice mentioned  above. In perhaps the clearest text about the  purpose of Jesus&rsquo; death, John tells his readers, &ldquo;[Jesus] is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but  also for the sins of the whole world&rdquo; (1 Jn. 2:2). Reminding his audience why Jesus came,  John tells them, &ldquo;You know that he appeared so that  he might take away our sins. And in him is no sin&rdquo; (1 Jn. 3:5). Here John connects the purpose and possibilityof Jesus&rsquo;  atonement: <em>to</em> take away our sins <em>by</em> his sinless sacrifice. A few verses  later, John reveals God&rsquo;s motive for sending Jesus: &ldquo;This is how we know what  love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us&rdquo; (1 Jn. 3:16). Jesus&rsquo;  substitutionary death is the <em>ultimate </em>expression  of God&rsquo;s love. </p>
  <p>Still more  striking is the portrait of Jesus&rsquo; death in the book of Revelation. After  introducing Jesus, John adds a revealing doxology: &ldquo;To  him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood&hellip;to him be glory  and power for ever and ever!&rdquo; (Rev. 1:5-6). John saw Jesus&rsquo; blood as primarily  an atoning sacrifice for sins. In fact, the association between Jesus and the  Old Testament sacrificial victim is so strong that John commonly refers to him  as &ldquo;the Lamb&rdquo; throughout his letter. At one point in John&rsquo;s vision, Jesus is  depicted as a slain Lamb standing on God&rsquo;s throne, while the encircling the  heavenly hosts sing: </p>
  <p>You are  worthy to take the scroll </p>
  <p>and to open  its seals, </p>
  <p>because you were slain, </p>
  <p>and with your blood you purchased men for God </p>
  <p>from every tribe and language and people and nation. (Rev.  5:9).</p>
  <p>John depicts the main purpose of  the Lamb&rsquo;s blood as purchasing &ldquo;men for God, from every tribe language and  people and nation.&rdquo; Later in John&rsquo;s vision the same multitude is described standing before the enthroned Lamb. One  of the elders announces, &ldquo;These are they who have come out of the great  tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of  the Lamb&rdquo; (Rev. 7:14). Clearly, the &ldquo;robes made white in  the Lamb&rsquo;s blood&rdquo; are a reference to Jesus&rsquo; blood cleansing us from our sins. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>All in all, our brief survey of  Scripture has left us with a harmony of voices that singularly affirm the central  theme of the atonement: Jesus came to die a substitutionary death for humanity.  Although other themes add richness and depth to our  understanding of the atonement, they in no way replace the sin-bearing sense that defines it. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Harmonizing  Scripture&rsquo;s Voice With a Theory of the Atonement </p>
  <p>Now that we have consulted  Scripture in our discussion, let&rsquo;s take another pass at the major theories of  the atonement. This time, however, we will try to harmonize each of the three  major theories with our findings from Scripture. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p><em>Moral Influence Theory</em></p>
  <p>From what we have  gathered so far, Scripture often speaks of the cross as God&rsquo;s ultimate display  of love. Because of this, it is no wonder that  some theologians have found its atoning value there. To  advocates of the moral influence theory, the power of the cross does not lie in  its objective, sin-bearing transaction, but in its subjective, inspiring power. Yet there are three reasons the moral influence theory cannot  be the principal way of understanding the atonement. </p>
  <p>First, champions  of the moral influence theory selectively employ passages of Scripture that  undergird their theory and reject texts that are incompatible with it. For instance, Rashdall  considered Jesus&rsquo; ransom saying (Mk. 10:45) to be a &ldquo;doctrinally coloured insertion.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" class="ftnref">35</a>  Similarly, Rashdall regards  Jesus&rsquo; last supper promise about the blood of the new covenant and the  forgiveness of sins as a later insertion. His reasoning? &ldquo;Our Lord never taught  that his death was necessary for the forgiveness of sins.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" class="ftnref">36</a>  This sort of thinking, John Stott observes, &ldquo;is a notable example of circular  reasoning.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" class="ftnref">37</a>  According to Stott, Rashdall is guilty of assuming  what he wishes to prove.<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" class="ftnref">38</a>  Stott&rsquo;s critique of Rashdall becomes even more  apparent in other, more candid statements. For example, Rashdall  thinks that our commitment to biblical inspiration must not prevent us from &ldquo;boldly  rejecting any formulae which&hellip;seem to say that sin cannot be forgiven without a  vicarious sacrifice.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" class="ftnref">39</a>  In other words, he is proposing that we <em>first</em> construct our view of the atonement and <em>then </em>virulently defend it against all objections. Thus, we should maintain that  Paul corrupted the pure message of Jesus due to the doctrinally tainting  influence of Isaiah 53. </p>
  <p>Secondly, the  moral influence theory is flawed in its central emphasis. As mentioned in the  section above, the moral influence theory focuses on God&rsquo;s  love for humanity. The driving force behind the atonement was to demonstrate  God&rsquo;s love to the human race and to elicit our responsive love. With this,  Scripture is in wholehearted agreement. Jesus&rsquo; entrance in the world and his  death were a supreme demonstration of God&rsquo;s love for humanity (1 Jn. 3:16; Rom.  5:8; Eph. 5:2). Further, Jesus&rsquo; proclamation of love, issuing from the cross,  inspires within us a new capability to love. John tells us &ldquo;We love because he  first loved us&rdquo; (1 Jn. 4:19). So far, then, we are in agreement. But there is  one question that remains unanswered: In what way does the cross display God&rsquo;s  love for humanity? Granted, true love must be self-giving.  But without purpose, an otherwise self-giving act of love would be nothing more  than foolishness. Take the example of being trapped in a burning building. If  you ran into a burning building in order to rescue me and did so successfully,  but in the process lost your own life, then  I would consider your actions to be a demonstration of your love. But if you  and I were standing outside of an empty burning building and I turned to you  and said, &ldquo;I want to you show you how much I love you,&rdquo; and then ran into the  burning building, you would think that I was mentally unstable or plainly  foolish. Likewise, Jesus&rsquo; death cannot be seen as an act of love unless he gave  up his life in order to rescue us. As John Stott puts it: &ldquo;His death must be  seen to have had an objective before it can have an appeal.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" class="ftnref">40</a>  And the objective behind the cross is clear  articulated by Scripture: Jesus died to bear the sins of humanity. The cross  can be understood as an act of love <em>insofar</em> as it is understood to be a <em>simultaneous</em> act of justice. </p>
  <p>Thirdly, the moral  influence theory fails to consider the Bible&rsquo;s grave prognosis for sin&rsquo;s  consequences. To quote Anselm&rsquo;s words against proponents of the moral influence  theory, &ldquo;[Y]ou have  not yet considered the seriousness of sin.&rdquo; Developed during the Enlightenment,  advocates of the moral influence theory had boundless confidence in human  reason and ability, but they lacked the profound  biblical understanding of humanity&rsquo;s rebellion against God and the indispensable  necessity of providing satisfaction to God for sin&rsquo;s consequences.<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" class="ftnref">41</a>  James Orr provides an interesting insight about Abelard&rsquo;s view of the atonement  &ldquo;[His] view of the atonement is defective precisely on the side on which Anselm  was strong,&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" class="ftnref">42</a>  namely, his view of sin and satisfaction. </p>
  <p>Fully aware of  these arguments, advocates of the moral influence theory believe that they  still have the last word. Jesus, they would say, taught forgiveness without the  need for atonement, based solely upon the person&rsquo;s repentance. In the parable  of the Pharisee and the tax gatherer, the latter beat his breast and said, &ldquo;God,  have mercy on me, a sinner&rdquo; (Lk. 18:9-14) and was  immediately justified. And in the parable of the lost son, the father took back  his repentant son without any sort of punishment (Lk.  15:11-24). In both of these parables,  God demonstrates his forgiveness without any mention of an atoning sacrifice.  </p>
  <p>Two responses can  be furnished. First of all, parables are not meant to provide a point-by-point  correspondence between the story and the message. Using the same line of  reasoning, Jesus is not mentioned in these parables, either. Does that suggest,  then, that he is <em>also </em>unnecessary for  our forgiveness? Scripture would emphatically answer &ldquo;No.&rdquo; We must keep in mind  that parables are illustrative stories that typically convey a single moral lesson.</p>
  <p>Secondly, both of  these parables contain characters that Jesus deliberately contrasts. There are  two worshippers in the temple&mdash;the  self-righteous Pharisee and the humble tax gatherer&mdash;and two  servants in the father&rsquo;s household--the  lost but ultimately repentant son and the righteous but prideful son. According  to Stott, these parables &ldquo;highlight, through contrast, the condition of  forgiveness, not its ground.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" class="ftnref">43</a>  Stated differently, these parables tell us what we need (to be forgiven) without telling us how the need is met. </p>
  <p>At  the end of the day, Scripture is the final arbiter for determining how we  should understand the atonement. Although Scripture affirms God&rsquo;s love as a  driving motivation for Jesus&rsquo; incarnation and death, it <em>equally</em> affirms the satisfaction of his divine justice. Abelard  wrongly tries to separate these two and render them mutually exclusive. Yet  Scripture affirms both motivations as operative in the cross. To quote the words  of Paul, God&rsquo;s motive in sending Jesus was &ldquo;to demonstrate his justice at the  present time, so as to be <em>just</em> and  the one who <em>justifies</em> those who have  faith in Jesus&rdquo; (Rom. 3:26). Brought together by one single act, God put his  unfailing love and uncompromising justice on display. </p>
  <p>To conclude, then,  Jesus&rsquo; appearance on earth and his death on the cross represent an unparalleled  revelation of God&rsquo;s love for humanity. Anselm and Abelard are not divided on  this point. In fact, it could be said that Anselm should have laid a heavier  emphasis upon God&rsquo;s love. But ultimately, Abelard was mistaken in denying the  substitutionary nature of the cross. Having  reconsidered the moral influence theory, we find that substitutionary  atonement prevails as the primary way to understand Jesus&rsquo; death. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p><em>Ransom Theory</em></p>
  <p>Next, we turn to reevaluate  the ransom theory. Like the moral influence theory, there is much to commend  the ransom theory. According to the ransom theory, God triumphed over Satan and  the forces of evil through the cross. Substitutionary atonement affirms this  fact. Jesus achieved a victory over evil when he gave his life as a ransom. Yet  from this point on, the two theories dramatically diverge.  According to the substitution theory, the ransom was paid to fulfill the  requirements of God&rsquo;s justice, not to Satan. </p>
  <p>First of all, if Christ&rsquo;s  death had been nothing more than a ransom payment to Satan, then the curse of  the law would not have been lifted from humanity. Scripture is clear about this  fact. Paul tells the Galatian believers: &ldquo;Christ  redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is  written: &lsquo;Cursed is everyone who is hung on a  tree&rsquo;&rdquo; (Gal. 3:13). Again  he says, &ldquo;When the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born  under law, to redeem those under law, that we might receive the full  rights of sons&rdquo; (Gal. 4:4-5). These verses indicate that a major aspect of Jesus&rsquo; mission was to redeem  humanity from the law&rsquo;s curse. And since God is the one who furnished the law, he  is also the one to whom  the debt must be paid for its violation. Therefore, Jesus&rsquo; death  must have been rendered to God. Otherwise, humanity would not have been fully  redeemed.</p>
  <p>Additionally, much of what  the ransom theory claims hinges upon the belief that Satan has rightful  possession of the human race. Surprisingly, some passages of Scripture seem to  verify this claim. First John tells us, &ldquo;We know that we are children of God,  and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one&rdquo; (1 Jn. 5:19). If  this <em>really</em> means that the evil one  has exclusive rights to humanity, then God <em>must</em> have paid a ransom to him. Yet, other texts seem to suggest that God is the  sole owner of the world and its inhabitants. For example, the psalmist writes, &ldquo;The earth is the Lord&rsquo;s, and everything in it, the  world, and all who live in it&rdquo; (Psa. 42:1). This passage plainly states that God is the rightful possessor  of the earth and all its inhabitants. Who, then, is the rightful owner of the  human race? The answer lies in the context of John&rsquo;s letter. Earlier in his  letter, John warns his readers: &ldquo;Do not love the world or anything in the  world&hellip;For everything in the world&mdash;the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his  eyes and the boasting of what he has and does&mdash;comes not from the Father but  from the world&rdquo; (1 Jn. 2:15-16). Here, John explains what he means by the term &ldquo;world&rdquo;:  the cravings of sinful man, the lust of the eyes, and the boasting of what  someone has or does. The &ldquo;world&rdquo; refers to a system of values Satan uses to ensnare  humanity. Thus, when John says that the world is controlled by the evil one, he  is not suggesting Satan&rsquo;s ownership of the  human race. Properly understood, then, God is the rightful owner of humanity,  not Satan. </p>
  <p>This does not mean,  however, that the evil one is incapable of enslaving the human race. His very  name reveals the nature of his strategy. The name Satan  literally means the &ldquo;accuser,&rdquo; and  according to the Bible, the evil one induces us to sin and then immediately  lays accusations against us. Having succeeded  in this, he is able to enslave us to sin and the fear of death. </p>
  <p>But, ultimately, it was  because of Jesus&rsquo; substitutionary death that we were liberated from being  enslaved to both sin and the fear of death. 1) First of all, Jesus&rsquo; death emancipates  us from our slavery to sin. While contrasting our &ldquo;old self&rdquo; to our &ldquo;new life&rdquo;  in Christ, Paul reminds the Romans believers: &ldquo;For we know that our old self  was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with, that we  should no longer be slaves to sin&mdash;because anyone who has died has been freed  from sin&rdquo; (Rom. 6:6-7). The connection is clear: we have been freed from the  slavery of sin because our &ldquo;old self&rdquo; was crucified with Christ. Colossians  2:13-15 is perhaps the most important passage in the New Testament, regarding  Jesus&rsquo; victory over sin: </p>
  <p>He forgave us all our sins, having canceled  the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood  opposed to us; he took it away, nailing it to the cross. And having  disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them,  triumphing over them by the cross.</p>
  <p>Paul here brings two aspects of Jesus&rsquo; saving work  together: the forgiveness of sins and the cosmic overthrow of evil powers. The  &ldquo;written code&rdquo; that has been cancelled is a reference to a signed confession of  indebtedness, which stood as a perpetual witness against us.<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" class="ftnref">44</a>  Paul indicates that God has cancelled the written code by &ldquo;nailing it to the  cross.&rdquo; This is a clear allusion to the tablet that was fixed over a crucified  person&rsquo;s head, stating his crime.<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" class="ftnref">45</a>  Of course, it was our crimes that were placed on Jesus&rsquo; written code, not his.  Thus, Paul&rsquo;s first point: God frees us from our bankruptcy by paying our debts  through the cross. Placed side-by-side with the concept of forgiveness, Paul  indicates that the cross also provided a victory over evil &ldquo;powers and  authorities.&rdquo; Through the cross, God permanently &ldquo;disarmed&rdquo; the evil one of his  accusations against God&rsquo;s character. And he also broke the bondage of sin,  whereby Satan is able to enslave humanity. In doing  these things, God has dismantled his enemy&rsquo;s armaments and vanquished him. It  is important to notice, however, that both the forgiveness of sins and the  triumph over evil happened together. It was by his payment of our debt that he  was able to overthrow the evil powers and authorities. 2) Secondly, the  substitutionary death of Jesus has set us free from the fear of death&rsquo;s grip  upon us. This is why Paul is able to taunt death: &ldquo;&rsquo;Where,  O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?&rsquo; The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus  Christ&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:55-57). Christ&rsquo;s death has ensured our eternal life, thus triumphing over death&rsquo;s grip on  humanity. The author of Hebrews adds, &ldquo;[H]e  too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who  holds the power of death&mdash;that is, the devil&mdash; and free those who all  their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death&rdquo; (2:14-15). It was  Christ&rsquo;s victory over death that undermined the devil&rsquo;s power to enslave us to  fear.</p>
  <p>In sum, Christ&rsquo;s death was  indeed God&rsquo;s triumph over the evil one, but only because it was a  substitutionary death. The ransom theory helps expand  our understanding of the boundless implications of the cross. By itself,  however, the ransom theory is inadequate to explain how we have been freed form  the curse of the law. Further, it wrongly attributes  ownership of the human race to the evil one. </p>
  <p><em></em></p>
  <p><em>Substitution Theory</em></p>
  <p>Although the two theories  above describe certain aspect of Jesus&rsquo; death, neither one can making sense of  all that Scripture has to say about the atonement. Substitutionary atonement  alone possesses this explanatory power. Furthermore, it incorporates both the  loving and victorious natures of the atonement emphasized by the other two  theories.</p>
  <p>While the  substitution theory corresponds with Scripture&rsquo;s view of the atonement, it also  coheres with other essential doctrines. First, it preserves the biblical  teaching of total depravity. If we possessed the ability to make ourselves  right before God, then Jesus needlessly died. Second, substitutionary atonement  fits with the biblical theme of God&rsquo;s righteous judgment. Unlike the moral influence  theory, which seeks to expunge God&rsquo;s wrath from the Bible, the substitution  theory understands Jesus&rsquo; death to be the satisfaction of it. Finally,  substitutionary atonement crucial for understanding the New Testament teaching  of law verses grace. According to the substitution theory, Jesus&rsquo; death lifted  the curse of the law, which enables believers to be freed from the law. Thus,  the New Testament declares that believers in Christ are no longer under law, but under grace (Rom. 6:14). Consequently,  the substitution theory not only coheres with these other major doctrines, in  some cases it is the key to understanding them. </p>
  <p>Finally, although there  is much to commend Anselm&rsquo;s formulation of the substitution theory, there are aspects  of it that are deficient. First of all, Anselm speculates about God&rsquo;s motive  for the atonement. In <em>Cur Deus Homo</em>,  he argues that some humans must be saved in order to offset the loss of fallen  angels. Therefore, the atonement was necessary.<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" class="ftnref">46</a>  Although this follows Anselm&rsquo;s purpose of arguing for the logical necessity of  the atonement, it lacks biblical support. Secondly, even though Anselm mentions  God&rsquo;s compassion as a characteristic of the atonement, it is largely absent  from his formulation of it. Meanwhile, Scripture insists that God&rsquo;s mercy was a  driving motive for the atonement. Incidentally, Anselm&rsquo;s lack of emphasis upon  God&rsquo;s mercy happens to be the biblically based motive for the atonement. </p>
  <p>In sum, the  substitution theory is the primary way to understand the atonement. The sheer  volume of Scripture devoted to the atonement, clearly portrays it as a  sin-bearing, substitutionary death. Moreover, the substitution theory is in  harmony with other major doctrines and in some cases is essential to our  understanding of them. And finally, the other major theories of the atonement  amplify our understanding of the substitution theory, yet they incapable of  taking its place as the primary view of the atonement. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Common  Objections to the Atonement</p>
  <p>Now that we have set a biblical  foundation for substitutionary atonement, we will turn out attention to some  common objections raised against it. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p><em>Why can&rsquo;t God just forgive without the Atonement?</em></p>
  <p>For a lot of  people, the idea that Jesus died to forgive humanity&rsquo;s sins does not make  sense. When presented with the cross&rsquo; meaning, people typically ask, &ldquo;Why did  Jesus have to die? Why couldn&rsquo;t God just forgive us?&rdquo; To many, the Christian  God reminds them of one of the vengeful gods in primitive religions that need  to be appeased by human sacrifice.<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" class="ftnref">47</a>  </p>
  <p>To explain the  necessity of Jesus&rsquo; substitutionary death, Timothy Keller uses an economic  example: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Imagine someone borrows your car, and as he backs out  of the driveway he strikes a gate, knocking it down along with part of a wall.  Your property insurance doesn&rsquo;t cover the gate and garden wall. What can you  do?&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" class="ftnref">48</a>  </p>
  <p>There are essentially two options.  The first would be to demand that this person pay for the damages. The second  is to absorb the cost of the damage and to release the person of any  responsibility. Of course, there may be a middle-of-the-road solution in which  you both share the payment. But in all of these options, someone must bear the  cost of the damage. Either you or the other person absorbs the cost for what he  did. But the debt does not simply go away or vanish into thin air. Thus, real  forgiveness requires costly suffering.</p>
  <p>Likewise, when we  commit acts of moral-wrongdoing, God has been personally damaged. And although  we may be remorseful for our actions, simply telling God &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; does not  undo the damage that has been done. Forgiveness means absorbing the damage of  someone else&rsquo;s sin, which means experiencing personal suffering and loss. Thus,  God absorbed the cost of our sin&rsquo;s damage through the suffering Jesus&rsquo; experienced  on the cross. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p><em>The Atonement Contradicts Jesus&rsquo; Teaching About  Forgiveness</em></p>
  <p> Some  critics of substitutionary atonement think that its vengeful nature contradicts  Jesus&rsquo; own teaching of peace and love. To suggest, then, that God requires  punishment before offering forgiveness depicts him as a hypocrite. Thus, the vengeful  nature of the atonement must be rejected. Substitutionary atonement, Stuart  Murray Williams suggests, &lsquo;is inherently violent and contravenes central  aspects of the message of Jesus.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" class="ftnref">49</a>  Others like Steve Chalke and Alan Mann, express their  objection more forcefully: &ldquo;If the cross is a personal act of violence  perpetrated by God towards humankind but borne by his Son, then it makes a  mockery of Jesus&rsquo; own teaching to love your enemies and not to repay evil with  evil.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" class="ftnref">50</a>  </p>
  <p>But these  objections fail to understand a certain aspect of God&rsquo;s nature, his justice.  The Bible teaches that God bears the <em>unique</em> responsibility of administrating justice in the universe. To simply ignore  moral wrongdoing would destroy the moral fabric of the universe &ndash;the  distinction between right and wrong. This is the reason why God cannot simply  overlook evil. He <em>must</em> punish moral  wrongdoing. </p>
  <p>Furthermore, God&rsquo;s  ultimate justice serves as the basis for the Bible&rsquo;s command not to repay evil  for evil. It is God&rsquo;s role to judge evil. While talking to persecuted believers,  Peter commands them: &ldquo;Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but  with blessing&rdquo; (1 Pet. 3:9). And yet, in nearly the same breath he gives them  this consolation: &ldquo;But they [those whom persecute you] will have to give  account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead&rdquo; (1 Pet. 4:5). In another place, Paul  tells the Roman believers: &lsquo;Do not repay anyone evil for evil&hellip;Do not take revenge,  my friends, but leave room for God&rsquo;s wrath, for it is written: &ldquo;It is mine to  avenge; I will repay,&rdquo; says the Lord&rsquo; (Rom. 12:17-19). Part of our motivation  to overlook evil and the solace we have that evil will not go on unpunished, is  that God is just and will ultimately avenge evil. </p>
  <p>Finally, unlike  human beings God is morally perfect. Often, when somebody does something wrong  against us, we are aware of our own contribution of wrongdoing in the  situation. Or, we are aware that we have wronged others on numerous other  occasions. And in some cases, we may have even wronged the person who has  presently wronging us. But in the case of God, there is no such element of  moral imperfection to minimize our moral wrongdoing. </p>

  <p><em>Cosmic Child Abuse</em></p>
  <p>Other critics  object that substitutionary atonement represents a type of &ldquo;divine child  abuse.&rdquo; Despite their charged language, it is easy to picture what they are  trying to describe. The Father is drunk with anger and is stampeding through  the house looking for us so that he can vent his uncontrollable rage. We of  course are hiding, afraid, hoping he will go away. Just as the Father sees us,  he rushes toward us. But the Son jumps in front of us, and the Father beats him  until his wrath has been satisfied and he has nothing left for us. It is easy  to envision the cross this way. In fact, many well-meaning followers of God  tend to envision the cross this way. But to see the atonement this way would be  a gross misunderstanding of God&rsquo;s character.</p>
  <p>It is important to  remember that the Christian faith has always understood Jesus to be God. God  did not inflict pain on someone else. Rather, on the cross he absorbed the  pain, violence, and evil of the world into himself. While speaking to his close  followers right before his death, Jesus said: &ldquo;I am the good shepherd. The good  shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. The reason my Father loves me is  that I lay down my life&mdash;only to take it up again. No one takes it from me, but  I lay it down of my own accord&rdquo; (Jn. 10:11; 17-18). Or again, while speaking to  the multitudes, Jesus declared: &ldquo;Whatever the Father does the Son also does&rdquo; (Jn.  5:19). And finally, on another occasion, Jesus said: &ldquo;Now my heart is troubled.  [As he looked forward to his death on the cross] What shall I say? &lsquo;Father,  save me from this hour?&rsquo; No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour. Father,  glorify your name!&rdquo; (Jn. 12:27-28) The clear picture that emerges from  Scripture is that Jesus was not the unfortunate victim of the angry Father.  Rather, the Father and the Son were working in concert through the cross to pay  for human sin. There is no division of will between the Father and the  Son. </p>
  <p>Another way to  understand this concept is through the illustration of &ldquo;the righteous judge.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" class="ftnref">51</a>  There was once a righteous judge who lived in a small rural province. He was renowned for his pursuit of justice  and integrity. Whenever someone stole, restitution was required. When a life  was taken, a life was required. </p>
  <p>On one day, the judge&rsquo;s  bailiff gave him a court docket containing the list of cases he would hear for  that day. When the judge opened it up, the first case on the list was murder. </p>
  <p>When the double  doors of the courtroom swung open, the judge looked up and saw the silhouette  of the defendant being escorted into the courtroom. As the defendant came into  the light, the judge was stunned to see that it was his son. </p>
  <p>When the case went  to trial, the evidence was overwhelming. Both physical and eyewitness evidence  was presented against the judge&rsquo;s son. By the end of the trial, it was clear  that his son was guilty without shadow of a doubt.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, the  controversy surrounding this case has brought the whole town out. In the  background, there was rumbling among the people in the community. Many of them  were interested to see what the judge would do. On the one hand, he loved his  son and did not want him to be punished. But on the other hand, as a judge he  was obligated maintain justice.</p>
  <p>At the close of  the trial, after all the evidence was laid out, after the closing arguments  were given, the judge adjourned for twenty minutes. It was tense in the  courtroom. Everyone eagerly awaited the judge&rsquo;s the pronouncement. When the  judge reemerged from his chamber, he entered the courtroom and sat down.  Silence filled the air. </p>
  <p>After a long  pause, the judge pronounced the verdict: &ldquo;The defendant is guilty as charged&hellip;  And the sentence is death.&rdquo; As soon as the judge finished speaking, the  courtroom exploded with talk. </p>
  <p>Meanwhile, the  judge stood up and took his robe off. When he did this, conversation came to an  abrupt halt. Everyone&rsquo;s attention was fixed upon the judge. He broke the  silence by saying to his son, &ldquo;Instead of you serving this sentence, I will  take the punishment upon you deserve. I will die in your place.&rdquo; In this  illustration, the father represents both judge and scapegoat. Likewise, Jesus  represented both the &ldquo;just and  the justifier&rdquo; (Rom. 3:26).</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Summary</p>
  <p>To sum up, then, Scripture clearly  speaks of the atonement as a sin-bearing, substitutionary death. Although  alternate theories of the atonement compliment and further enrich our  understanding of the atonement, they are incapable of taking substitution  theory&rsquo;s place as the central theme of the atonement. </p>
  <p>To bring King  Solomon&rsquo;s words back to mind, &ldquo;There is nothing new under the sun.&rdquo; The promise  to repaint the atonement is nothing more than a fabrication of past efforts to  deny its substitutionary nature. One day, the popularity of this attempt will  pass away and a new one will emerge to take its place. But our assurance of the  meaning and purpose of the atonement is fixed. This is because, as Isaiah  observes, &ldquo;The grass withers and  the flowers fall, but the word of our God stands forever&rdquo; (Isa. 40:8). </p>

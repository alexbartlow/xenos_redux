<h1>Christ's View of the Authority <br>
of Canonical Scripture: <br>
A Paradigm for Systematic Theology</h1>

<h5>Christopher Louis Lang</h5>

<p>March 1995</p>

<hr>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>There are a number of ways to approach the question of inerrancy. But what I am
concerned with is the Bible's view of itself. We could look at this question from the
perspective of each author or each segment of scripture and ask how the Torah views its
authoritativeness, and alternately then the Prophets, the Writings, the Gospels, etc.,
until we put together a comprehensive view on the scripture's attestation of its own
authority. </p>

<p>But as this  task would be far beyond the scope of this paper, I will
adopt a shorter route. Probably the most fruitful and concise way to examine the
Scripture's view of itself is through the words of Christ. As he is God's revelation,
God's Word, which has come to us in human form, he has the greatest potential to shed
light on the entirety of Scripture. In Christ we have the references to God's past
revelation (still current and operative), God's present revelation in Christ's person and
words, and what would be His future revelation through the disciples. What I am proposing
is that Christ's view on the authority of the biblical text is paradigmatic of the
Scripture's view of itself.</p>

<p>In taking this approach at least one potential objection may be raised against it and
it is best to deal with this up front. That objection is the charge of circular reasoning,
that is that we are using the Scripture's own testimony to support itself. In other words,
what Christ says about the Scripture is contained within the Scripture itself. There are
no external witnesses to corroborate Christ's words and therefore we are left with the
Bible affirming its own truthfulness.</p>

<p>In order to deal with this criticism we need to establish the text's reliability as a
witness before proceeding to demonstrate Christ's views regarding his authority or the
authority of past or future revelation. If the text shows itself to be reliable in matters
of history including statements of fact as well as geography, etc., then we may conclude
that it is a reliable source regarding other matters that it affirms (See my paper
entitled Doubting.doc for a more complete argument regarding the reliability of the text.)
For time's sake and to avoid duplication we can affirm that the text is indeed a reliable
witness. And because it is a reliable witness we may reasonably conclude that it
represents Christ's words faithfully. Therefore, let us examine what He has said. </p>

<p>What is immediately apparent upon reading Jesus' references to Scripture is that He
quotes it in a variety of ways referring to the author at times or making general
allusions to the past or broadly affirming its character. In all of the manners and ways
in which He communicates regarding the Scripture, His high views of it are apparent. For
our purposes, Christ's handling of Scripture can be divided into three types of usage:
references, quotations, and direct affirmations. In His references to Scripture He
directly or indirectly lends authority to an event such as Moses' writing of the law or
the factual nature of Noah's experiences. In quotations of Scripture, Christ submits to
its authority and bestows on it His approval in numerous ways including the well known
formula &quot;it is written.&quot; Although less frequent, though no less important, are
Christ's direct affirmations to the Scripture's veracity. But while these are important,
what is more telling as to Christ's view of the Scripture, is His casual use of Scripture.
Even without His direct attestation to it, His views regarding Scripture are apparent. </p>

<hr>

<h3>References to Scripture</h3>

<p>Christ makes use of two kinds of references to Scripture apart from directly quoting
it: references of fact and indirect references. In the former Christ assumes the
historicity of the event, lending to it His authority as if to say, &quot;this actually
happened.&quot; Examples of this kind of reference are numerous. &quot;I tell you the
truth, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of
judgment, than for that city&quot; (Mtt 10:15). In this statement Christ lends His
authority both to the factual existence of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, and their
judgment, as well as the biblical teaching of a judgment yet to come. Likewise,
regarding Noah and the events of his life, &quot;For the coming of the Son of Man will be
just like the days of Noah. For as in those days which were before the flood they were
eating and drinking they were marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah
entered the ark . . . (Mtt 24:36ff). Christ maintains that there was a person in history
named Noah who lived and whose existence follows a chronology preceding and postdating a
cataclysmic earth wide flood.</p>

<p>Christ repeatedly refers to events, not as stories being told in order to illustrate a
point (as He does with parables e.g., <i>omoioV estin</i>), but as factual historical
events. &quot;There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah. . . . there were
many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha. . . (Lk 4:25ff.). He refers to Jonah and the
actual people of Nineveh who lived and died there. He refers to Lot and the wicked city in
which he lived, as well as to many other historical persons and events. Christ affirms
that Scripture is accurate as an historical document and what it teaches are not stories
but historical events.</p>

<p>Christ lends his authority to biblical authorship as well by other references of fact.
He makes statements such as, &quot;in the book of Moses&quot; (Mrk12:26), &quot;David
said&quot; (Mrk 12:36), &quot;spoken through Daniel the prophet&quot; (Mtt 24:15). While
it is certainly possible to argue that Christ lends His authority only to those passages
which he actually cites, or that He spoke to accommodate Himself to the reader, to do this
is to read into the text. It is to enforce an artificial interpretation on the natural
reading, an interpretation which is beyond demonstration. The most natural,
straightforward reading is that Christ believed and affirmed that these books were indeed
written by these men. </p>

<p>Christ indirectly references Scripture, as well. Some of these passages give powerful
insight into Christ's beliefs for the very reason that they are not His direct teachings
regarding Scriptures. What they reveal are more foundational, that is, His assumptions
regarding Scripture.<a href="#Footnote1B" name="Footnote1A">Footnote1</a>
&quot;The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses;
therefore all that they tell you, do and observe, but do not do according the their deeds;
for they say things, and do not do them&quot; (Mtt 23:2,3). Christ is indicating that the
law of Moses is binding regardless of who teaches it. The &quot;chair of Moses&quot; is
authoritative for life and not subject to the attestations of men, for the very reason, as
we shall see, that there is a difference between men's teachings and traditions and God's
truth. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Mark 7:8,9. In the context of quoting an Old
Testament passage Christ says, &quot;Neglecting the commandment of God, you hold to the
tradition of men. . . You nicely set aside the commandment of God in order to keep your
tradition.&quot; Christ draws a sharp distinction here between the words of men,
presumably the Talmud and various other traditions, and the words of God. The words of men
are not binding on mankind, in fact they are to be subservient to God's commandments. </p>

<hr>

<h3>Quotations from Scripture</h3>

<p>And what are God's commandments? Here we move out of Christ's indirect references to
Scripture and into direct quotations, specifically, those in which the author of Scripture
is spoken of interchangeably with God. Christ continues in the very next verse of Mark,
&quot;For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother. . .'&quot; The words of God are
the words of Moses, and Isaiah (quoted by Christ in the preceding verses Mark 7:6,7), and
the rest of the Old Testament Scriptures. Christ does not ascribe these words to a human
author as though they were human and therefore less binding. Another instance of a similar
kind occurs in Matthew 19: 4-5. &quot;The Creator said, 'For this reason a man will leave
his father and mother.&quot; Christ attributes Moses' words, the author of Genesis, as
belonging to &quot;the Creator.&quot; In citing Moses' words He ascribes them to the very
words of God, their real author.<a href="#Footnote2B" name="Footnote2A">Footnote2</a>
Somehow God has worked through Moses and Isaiah to produce words that are God's very own
as Christ calls them &quot;the commandment of God.&quot; What greater attestation could we
have from Christ than to equate Scripture with God's words, to equate writings of human
instrumentality with divine actuality.<a href="#Footnote3B" name="Footnote3A">Footnote3</a></p>

<p>Christ quotes the Scriptures in many other ways. He uses quotations to attest to His
ministry, to clarify truth, to demonstrate prophetic fulfillment, as well as to
demonstrate its binding nature as in the use of the phrase &quot;it is written.&quot;
Scripture is a foundational part of Jesus' ministry as He demonstrates by His reliance
upon and usage of Scripture. In every phase of His life and ministry He showed a complete
reliance on Scripture. Never correcting it or overruling it but rather clarifying Jewish
interpretation of it and thereby affirming His commitment to it.</p>

<p>Christ also uses the Scriptures as an attestation of truth. While this may be an all
too obvious usage, it is necessary to call attention to it in order to see the importance
of Scriptures in Jesus' ministry. When the Jews misunderstood something or emphasized one
principle to the detriment of another Christ valued the truth of Scriptures enough to
correct their misunderstanding because their use of the holy writ was not simply a
religious exercise but a matter of utmost importance. Thus Christ quotes Hosea 6:6 &quot;I
desire compassion, and not sacrifice,&quot; to correct their rigid view of the Sabbath.
Had Christ not viewed this as an issue of ultimate importance and relevance, He could have
overlooked it. But it was a misunderstanding that dealt with the Scriptures and their view
of God and He could not overlook this. Their traditions, men's words, had overridden the
Scripture, God's words. And therefore Jewish teachings had corrupted their understanding
of who God was. And this is what Christ challenged referring them back to Scripture as the
final court of appeal to correct their false views of God.</p>

<p>He also attests to the Scripture's ability to provide the truth necessary for
salvation. The Scriptures' so thoroughly attest to the truth of God that they are
sufficient for salvation. Christ responds to the lawyer in Luke 10:25 who asks what he
must do to inherit eternal life, after quoting from the law Christ responds to him,
&quot;You have answered correctly; Do this, and you will live.&quot; If understood and
applied correctly the Scriptures are necessary and adequate for salvation. It is difficult
to overstate this point. That is, the Scriptures are so thoroughly God's word, as we have
previously seen, not just the words of men, and in that they are God's word they are able
to bring men to Him. They provide a right perspective of God as well as a right
perspective of men and therefore dictate the terms by which one can approach the other.</p>

<p>The Scriptures' ability to provide salvation find their fulfillment in Christ, for they
bear witness to Him. This is another of the means by which Jesus uses the Scriptures, as
they relate to fulfilled prophecy. He is careful to draw His listeners back to the
authoritative word. Christ begins his ministry in the gospel of Luke by reading from
Isaiah 61. Upon completing his reading of the text he declares, &quot;Today this Scripture
has been fulfilled in your hearing&quot; (Lk 4:21). </p>

<p>He places a great amount of emphasis on the fulfillment of Scripture in order to
demonstrate and affirm its veracity. In referring to His deliverance to the authorities He
claims, &quot;But all this has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets may be
fulfilled&quot; (Mtt 26:56). And again, &quot;These are My words which I spoke to you
while I was still with you, that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses
and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled&quot; (Lk 24:44). He affirms that the
Scriptures are true and must happen as they so declare. God's will as recorded in
Scripture is not subject to the will of man. The words are true and God will intervene to
bring them to pass. God is bound, not by the words of men, but by His own words, His own
promises.</p>

<p>However, it is not just that Christ attests to Scripture's truth in prophetic
fulfillment, but that the Scriptures attest to Him. In fact he rests His authority on the
veracity of prophetic Scripture. &quot;For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me;
for he wrote of Me. But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My
words?&quot; (John 5:46ff.). Christ is willing to stake His ministry and His character on
the truthfulness of Scripture. </p>

<p>This point cannot be overlooked. If the Scriptures are in error, how can they attest to
one who is without error? If the Scriptures are fallible, then in what way can we depend
on them to attest to Christ? Without question God uses fallible human means to attest to
His infallibility, but never does God tie His infallibility to humans in the way in which
Christ ties His truthfulness to that of the Scriptures. If the Bible is in error, then
surely Christ cannot be trusted. This may not be a position we would want to place Christ
in, but it is the position in which He puts Himself.</p>

<p>An accurate demonstration of Christ's reliance upon Scripture is given in each of the
synoptic gospels upon Christ's death. According to the synoptic gospels, the last words
out of Jesus' mouth before His death are words from the Scripture. Mark and Matthew show
Him quoting Psalm 22, &quot;My God, My God, why Hast Thou forsaken me?&quot; (Mtt 27:46,
Mrk 15:34). Luke demonstrates the same idea, &quot;Into Thy hands I commit my spirit&quot;
(Lk 23:56). With Matthew and Mark, and possibly Luke, the Scriptures He quotes are
prophetic. Until His last breath Jesus is pointing to the truthfulness of the Scriptures
to demonstrate that His character and ministry are from God and not from man just as the
Scriptures are God's words and not man's.</p>

<p>Another way in which God's word is quoted by Christ as such is in the use of the
formula &quot;it is written.&quot; This formula appears 39 times in the gospels, 26 of
those are from the mouth of Christ. He uses this phrase as an ultimate appeal to
authority. When the Jews could not believe that their &quot;vineyard&quot; might be given
to another, Christ appeals to the Scripture. &quot;What then is this that <i>is written</i>,
'The stone which the builders rejected, this became the chief corner stone?'&quot; (Lk
20:17). Jesus shows that He accepts as authoritative everything that &quot;is
written,&quot; including His own suffering. &quot;For I tell you, that which <i>is written</i>
must be fulfilled in Me, 'And he was numbered with transgressors'; for that which refers
to Me has its fulfillment&quot; (Lk 22:37). </p>

<p>Of the &quot;it is written&quot; formulaic passages probably the most important are
those occurring in the beginning of Matthew and Luke in the temptation narratives. While
Christ is being tempted by the devil in the wilderness a battle takes place and the
weapons of warfare used by Christ, and the devil, are the Scriptures. Jesus is shown as
being tempted three times: to satisfy His needs, to prove His identity, and to gain power.
In all three situations he responds by quoting Scripture beginning with the formula
&quot;it is written.&quot; What is significant here is that instead of battling Satan
based on His own authority, which He could have done, He rests His authority on the
biblical writings. Jesus demonstrates His utter dependence on the truthfulness of the
written word. &quot;It is written&quot; is the ultimate appeal to authority. Its
equivalent is &quot;God said&quot; or &quot;thus saith the Lord.&quot; This is the power
Christ rests on and this is the power that silences His adversary. For Christ, and even
Satan, &quot;it is written&quot; is the last word for it demonstrates the authority of
God.</p>

<p>The last aspect of Christ's teaching to be examined is His direct affirmations of
Scripture. In this section I am including His attestations to the Old Testament as well as
His attestation of His own words. In Luke 16:17 we hear Christ speak these words,
&quot;But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter
of the Law to fail.&quot; God's truthfulness in the written word will last longer than the
heavens and earth. This remarkable statement certainly appears to indicate that Christ
valued every detail of written Scripture as true. Notice that Christ does not appeal to
the &quot;word of God&quot; language that might have protected Him from affirming the
authority of potentially corrupted written texts. He affirms that not one &quot;stroke of
a letter&quot; will fail.<a href="#Footnote4B" name="Footnote4A">Footnote4</a>
He immediately applies this by adding that divorce is wrong. Man's traditions cannot
override God's written word from the most minute to the most essential issues.</p>

<p>Matthew witnesses to Christ's unbending commitment to the written word in the same
manner. &quot;Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come
to abolish, but to fulfill. For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not
the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law, until all is
accomplished&quot; (Mtt 5:17,18). Later in Matthew's gospel Jesus demonstrates just how
seriously He takes this statement. In correcting the Sadducees' view of the resurrection,
Jesus bases His argument on the tense of one verb, &quot;'I <i>am</i> the God of Abraham,
and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' He is not the God of the dead but of the
living&quot; (Mtt 22:32). Christ affirms the Scriptures as accurate down to the verb
tenses.</p>

<p>As with the written word of God, Christ maintains that His words are good for
salvation, they will not pass away, and they are equal to the Father's words. While His
words were not canonical at the time that He spoke them, it is worth briefly noting their
relationship to His teaching on the canonical Scriptures. &quot;Heaven and earth will pass
away, but My words shall not pass away&quot; (Mtt 24:35, Lk 21:33). In saying this Christ
maintains that His words will survive, presumably also in written form, and that they are
virtually the same as the rest of the written Scriptures. This view is buttressed by John
14:23, 24. &quot;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him,
and We will come to him, and make Our abode with him. He who does not love Me does not
keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father's who sent
Me.&quot; God's words are recorded in the Old Testament scriptures and they are also
spoken through Jesus. </p>

<p>The question as to the truthfulness, infallibility, inerrancy of the Scriptures comes
to rest on the person of Jesus Christ. Who is Christ? Who we decide Christ to be will
determine what we decide about the Scriptures. If Christ is God, all knowing and all
loving then we can come to no other conclusion than His own. The written word is truthful
in every stroke of every letter. If however Christ is not God or not loving and truthful,
then we can believe what we will regarding the Scriptures. What we cannot do, in order to
remain true to Christ and the Bible, is to mingle these views. We cannot legitimately hold
to Christ's divinity and veracity while holding to fallible Scriptures. The authority of
both are intimately tied together, not by our logic but by Christ's own words. One basing
His authority on the other, the other attesting to the authority of the One. We cannot
hold for a fallible Scripture and an infallible Christ, just as it would be ludicrous to
hold for an infallible Scripture and a fallible Christ. Each attests to the other and we
must decide what to do with them both, for they present themselves as a package. </p>

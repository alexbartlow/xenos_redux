<h1>Watchman Nee <br>
  Section V</h1>
<h5>By <a href="../personal/den.htm">Dennis McCallum</a></h5>
<hr>
<h3>Nee's Doctrine</h3>
<p>Nee was clearly influenced by the Plymouth Brethren and the Keswick, or &quot;victorious 
  life,&quot; form of teaching. He also read and admired Hudson Taylor, George 
  Meuller, and Madam Guyon. These influences are evident from the time of &quot;The 
  Spiritual Man&quot; (1923) up until &quot;The Normal Christian Life.&quot;53 
  The appeal of his preaching, according to Kinnear's sources, was &quot;his gift 
  of making so plain the way to God that relies solely upon Christ's finished 
  work. All too many Christians were striving after a salvation based on good 
  works.&quot;54 </p>
<p>Late in his career, Nee is said to have developed some doctrinal aberrations 
  that went beyond his usual purism. These areas had to do with a heavy emphasis 
  on authority and submission, and an increasing tendency to dichotomize the material 
  and the spiritual, or the ideal and the real. Some of the literature published 
  during the past ten years claiming to originate from the last 5 years of Nee's 
  ministry are definitely deserving of criticism at many points.55 However, care 
  must be exercised here because of an unusual feature in his writings. Only two 
  books actually written by Nee's own hand are available in English. These are 
  Concerning Our Missions, and The Spiritual Man. Ironically, Nee criticized both 
  of these works.56 His other works are translated from notes taken from his lectures, 
  and are therefore open to interpretive additions by the translators.57 </p>
<p>Initially, Angus Kinnear translated notes to produce several titles, including 
  his best known works, The Normal Christian Life, Love Not The World, Changed 
  into His Likeness, and What Shall This Man Do?. Later, the Little Flock church 
  under the leadership of Steven Kaung published a series of books that all have 
  the distinctive plain colored covers of the &quot;Christian Fellowship Publishers&quot; 
  in New York. These include Spiritual Authority, Spiritual Knowledge, and Gospel 
  Dialogue, to name a few. It seems clear to this author and others58 that there 
  is a more radical interpretation of Nee evident in the later books. </p>
<p>At the same time, it can not be denied that Nee was extreme in some areas, 
  including spiritual authority and ecclesiology. </p>
<p>The emphasis on delegated human authority was in perfect harmony with Confucian 
  ethics. Confucius taught that parents were never wrong, and that even when they 
  were, one should obey them. </p>
<p>To understand Nee's extreme doctrine of &quot;locality&quot;, one must remember 
  that he had had a run-in with the exclusive brethren in England, and may have 
  formed a rather one-sided picture of denominationalism in the west. He certainly 
  did not want to see the western denominational divisions transplanted into China, 
  let alone the unloving divisiveness of the exclusive brethren, and he can hardly 
  be faulted for that. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, the fact remains that Nee propounded an unworkable and unbiblical 
  doctrine of locality and of under-qualified obedience to delegated authority 
  which has resulted in extremism in modern America, China, and elsewhere.59</p>
<hr>
<h3>Nee's Legacy</h3>
<p>It is hard to tell how large the Little Flock movement was in China at the 
  time of the revolution. One reason for this is the fact that Nee felt it was 
  fleshly to consider numbers. Therefore there was no systematic effort made by 
  Little Flock themselves to count their people. There was no formal membership 
  in the group, since Nee believed membership in the body of Christ was determined 
  by God, and there was no good reason for the church to try to draw up a list. 
</p>
<p>According to Cliff, in 1949 the Little Flock had over 70,000 members in 500 
  assemblies.60 However, according to the Ecumenical Press Service the &quot;Little 
  Flock&quot; had at this time 362 places of worship and 39,000 members in the 
  one province of Chekiang. These figures were interpreted as indicating that 
  members of the &quot;Little Flock&quot; made up 15-20 per cent of the whole 
  Protestant church in China, and that they may have been the largest single denomination.61 
  In other words, this estimate would show anywhere from 150,000 to 300,000 members 
  for the Little Flock. Cheung affirms that there were &quot;thousands&quot; of 
  assemblies by 1956, and that the Little Flock was the largest Christian group 
  in China.62 </p>
<p>Nobody has even hazarded a guess as to how many of the millions of Christians 
  meeting in house churches today may be the outgrowth of Little Flock groups. 
  Two things are clear: There are many house churches that are directly derived 
  from Little Flock churches, and there are many other groups that owe a substantial 
  debt to Little Flock doctrine and practice for their survival. </p>
<p>The following characteristics detailed by Adeney demonstrate that God has certainly 
  used the unique features of Little Flock to prepare Chinese Christians to live 
  under the terrible social conditions of modern China. </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>When the organized churches were destroyed in the Cultural Revolution, traditional 
    forms of Christian ministry were also done away with. The household churches 
    have cast off the trappings of the West and have developed their own forms 
    of ministry. . . The dynamics of house churches, therefore, flow partly from 
    their freedom from institutional and traditional bondage. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and further, </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Much that we associate with the Church is not found in Chinese house churches 
    today. They have had to exist without buildings, set times of worship or a 
    paid ministry. During the Cultural Revolution and even up to the present, 
    the place of meeting is often changed form one home to another. Even the time 
    is changed to suit the schedules of the Christians as they work at different 
    hours. Thus, the house churches are extremely flexible.63 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cliff agrees that, </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Many of the features of the 'post Denominational Church' in China Nee would 
    warmly endorse, denominational labels have gone. . . as he advocated for many 
    years. Most of the pastors are self-supporting and the laity plays a prominent 
    role in church life-- features with which he would be in full agreement. The 
    Church has been freed from the encumbrances of maintaining large premises 
    and of running institutional work.64 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is obvious to this author that God was at work during the last years of 
  freedom in China to establish an underground network of house churches that 
  were ideally suited to survive and grow even in the appalling circumstances 
  of the last 35 years. The groups have a distinct Chinese flavor in their doctrinal 
  outlook and are entirely used to carrying on Christian witness on an underground 
  basis.65 </p>
<p>Finally, Cliff and Adeney report that in the past few years, some groups have 
  split off from the regular Little Flock churches to follow the teachings of 
  Witness Lee. These have been dubbed (no doubt by their enemies) the &quot;screamers.&quot; 
  The name derives from ecstatic prayers offered in unison in the meetings. The 
  screamers have been the target of special persecution in the past five years. 
</p>
<p>According to Cliff, </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Many China watchers feel that the Chinese government is making the fanatical 
    behavior of 'the Screamers' an excuse for tightly controlling all unaffiliated 
    groups.66 </p>

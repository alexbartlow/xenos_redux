<h1>Paul's Usage of <i>ta stoicheia tou kosmou</i></h1>


<hr>

<p>by <a href="../personal/gary.htm">Gary DeLashmutt</a></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The purpose of this paper is to examine the meaning of the phrase <i>ta stoicheia tou
kosmou </i>(&quot;the elementary principles of the world&quot;) as it is used by Paul in
Gal. 4:3,9 and Col. 2:8,20. First, I will conduct a brief examination of the non-biblical
and biblical usage of <i>stoicheion</i> (&quot;elementary principles&quot;). Next, I will
analyze the three traditional interpretations of the phrase. Finally, I will adopt and
apply one of those interpretations.</p>

<h3>Extra-Biblical Usage of <i>stoicheian</i></h3>


<p>By the fourth century B. C., the verbal form of the root (<i>stoicheo</i>) was used to
mean &quot;to be in a line,&quot; &quot;to march in rank and file.&quot;<a href="#Footnote1B"></a><a name="Footnote1A"> Footnote1</a> The New Testament usage of the
verb <i>stoicheo</i> retains an element of this usage in the five times that it is used.<a href="#Footnote2B"></a><a name="Footnote2A"> Footnote2</a> </p>

<p>The general meaning of the noun form (<i>stoicheion</i>) was &quot;what belongs to a
series.&quot;<a href="#Footnote3B"></a><a name="Footnote3A"> Footnote3</a> It developed
five different but related meanings from this same period (fourth century B.C.) and later
pre-Christian literature. <i>Stoicheion</i> was used to mean variously &quot;the length of
a shadow on the sundial,&quot; &quot;part of a syllable or a word,&quot; &quot;the
essential elements of the cosmos,&quot; &quot;smallest parts (of anything) which stand in
relation to one another,&quot; and &quot;the stars or astral bodies as elements of
fire.&quot;<a href="#Footnote4B"></a><a name="Footnote4A"> Footnote4</a> According to
Delling, <i>stoicheion</i> came to be identified with &quot;stellar spirits associated
with those heavenly bodies&quot; only after the New Testament was written.<a href="#Footnote5B"></a><a name="Footnote5A"> Footnote5</a> This fact becomes important in
the interpretation of the Pauline passages.</p>

<h3>Non-Pauline New Testament Usage</h3>

<p>The noun form <i>stoicheion</i> is used only seven times in the New Testament. Apart
from Paul's use of it in Gal. 4:3,9 and Col. 2:8,20, Peter uses it in 2&nbsp;Pet. 3:10,12
and the author of Hebrews uses it in Heb. 5:12. In each of these non-Pauline usages, <i>stoicheion</i>
is used in one of its classical meanings. In 2 Pet. 3, it clearly refers to the physical
elements of the universe which will be destroyed by the Lord at the end of the age. The
author of Hebrews uses it to refer to basic or elementary teachings, either about Jesus or
Old Testament religion.<a href="#Footnote6B"></a><a name="Footnote6A"> Footnote6</a> </p>
<i>

<h3>Ta Stoicheia Tou Kosmou</h3>
</i>

<blockquote>
  <p>See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow philosophy and empty deception,
  according to the tradition of men, according to the <i>elementary principles of the world</i>,
  rather than according to Christ. . .If you have died with Christ to <i>the elementary
  principles of the world</i>, why, as if you were living in the world, do you submit
  yourself to decrees such as, &quot;Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!&quot;. . .
  (Col. 2:8,20,21)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So we, while we were children, were held in bondage under <i>the elementary principles
  of the world</i>&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be
  known by God, how is it that you turn back again to <i>the weak and worthless elementary
  things</i>, to which you desire to be enslaved all over again? You observe days and months
  and seasons and years. (Gal.&nbsp;3:3,9,10)<a href="#Footnote7B"></a><a name="Footnote7A">
  Footnote7</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paul uses the phrase &quot;of the world&quot; (<i>tou kosmou</i>) to describe<i> </i>&quot;the
elementary principles&quot; in three of his four usage's of <i>ta stoicheia</i>. It is
obvious that Paul is using the phrase &quot;of the world&quot; in a negative sense. In the
remaining usage of &quot;the elementary principles&quot; (Gal. 4:9), Paul clearly intends
the same negative meaning as the other three because he describes them with the phrase
&quot;weak and worthless.&quot;</p>

<p>In both letters, Paul is refuting false teachings which have infiltrated the churches.
It seems evident that the Colossian heresy was some sort of Greek-Jewish synthesis,
perhaps a form of proto-gnosticism. The Galatian heresy appears to be a form of
traditional Palestinian Judaism which insists that the Galatian Christians also take on
the Old Testament law as a requisite for salvation. It is the view of this author that its
advocates were the &quot;Judaizer&quot; party of the Jerusalem church which was later
denounced by the Jerusalem Council recorded in Acts 15.<a href="#Footnote8B"></a><a name="Footnote8A"> Footnote8</a> In both cases, Old Testament practices are being
prescribed in a way which undercuts the full sufficiency of Jesus' work on the cross, thus
calling forth some of Paul's clearest written teaching on the subject of the finished work
of Christ (Col. 2:10-15; Gal. 2:16-21). </p>

<h3>The Three Classical Interpretations</h3>

<p>Three classical interpretations of &quot;the elementary principles of the world&quot;
have been formulated, though each interpretation has a number of variations. The following
is a summary of those interpretations, their leading advocates, and the main support and
problems for each view.<a href="#Footnote9B"></a><a name="Footnote9A"> Footnote9</a></p>
<b>

<p align="CENTER">The Law of Israel</p>
</b>

<p>The first view holds that Paul is referring to the Law of Israel. This view, which is
advocated by Lightfoot, Stott and Tenney among others, stresses the way in which Paul
connects being &quot;under the Law&quot; in Gal. 3:23; 4:5 with being &quot;under the
elementary principles of the world&quot; in Gal. 4:3. It also cites the fact that in each
case, the heretics are prescribing Old Testament laws (see Col. 2:16,21; Gal. 4:10). </p>

<p>Certainly there <i>is</i> a connection between these two concepts, but it is
overstating the case to call them synonymous for at least two reasons. First, it seems
unlikely for Paul to call &quot;the world&quot; the origin of the Law of Israel. In Gal.
3:19-23, Paul teaches that God gave the Law to keep Israel under custody until the coming
of Messiah. Whatever this may mean, it certainly affirms the divine origin of the Law and
its essential righteousness. </p>

<p>The biggest problem with this interpretation is that it does not account for the fact
that in both passages, Paul also uses this phrase to refer to Gentile and/or heretical
teachings. In Col. 2:8, Paul refers to &quot;philosophy and empty deception, according to
the tradition of men, according to `the elementary principles of the world,' rather than
according to Christ.&quot; This passage makes it clear that the phrase refers to something
originating from the sphere of man rather than from Christ. In Gal. 4:9, Paul says that
the Galatians are in danger of returning again to the <i>stoicheia</i>, when their first
involvement with them was pagan idolatry (vs. 8). Therefore, this interpretation is
inadequate as a full explanation of the phrase.</p>
<b>

<p align="CENTER">The Demonic Spirits</p>
</b>

<p>Most scholars argue that Paul is referring to the satanic demons which have originated
the false teachings which Paul is refuting. Paul calls them &quot;the elementary
principles of the world&quot; because the heretics were referring to them as the
spirit-beings which rule over the heavens. Far from being a superior revelation from God
which will bring them spiritual liberation, Paul ironically implies that this teaching
originates from demons and will therefore only bring them into bondage. Among the scholars
who hold this view are Boice, <a href="#Footnote10B"></a><a name="Footnote10A">Footnote10</a>
F. F. Bruce, Vaughn, Guthrie and Carson.<a href="#Footnote11B"></a><a name="Footnote11A">
Footnote11</a></p>

<p>Support for this interpretation is found from a number of sources. The fact most cited
by the above authors is that &quot;the elementary principles&quot; is used in
extra-biblical literature to refer to the stellar spirits which were identified with the
heavenly bodies. <a href="#Footnote12B"></a><a name="Footnote12A">Footnote12</a> Both
passages also make reference to angels in some relationship to the phrase. In
Gal.&nbsp;3:19, Paul refers to angels as the mediators through which God gave the Law. In
Gal.&nbsp;4:8, he speaks of &quot;those which are by nature no gods&quot; which the
Galatians formerly worshipped, and then seemingly applies &quot;the elementary
principles&quot; to them in vs. 9. In Col. 2:18, Paul speaks of &quot;the worship of
angels&quot; as part of the heresy associated with the &quot;the elementary
principles.&quot;</p>

<p>There are, however, several problems with this view. The most formidable problem is
that Paul's usage of &quot;the elementary principles&quot;<i> </i>definitely includes the
Law of Israel (see above). It is very difficult to see how the worship of stellar spirits
could be construed by Paul to be a part of Old Testament Law when it specifically
prohibits such worship (see Ex. 20:3-5). The references to dietary laws (Col. 2:16) and
calendar observances (Gal. 4:10) are obviously Old Testament, but many of those who hold
this view try unsuccessfully to prove that they are actually Greek practices.<a href="#Footnote13B"></a><a name="Footnote13A"> Footnote13</a> This is a serious weakness
of the view, especially for the Galatians passage, because it is impossible that the
Judaizers were prescribing astrological observances.</p>

<p>Delling deals what seems to be a lethal blow to this view. He claims that <i>stoicheion</i>
was not used to refer to spiritual beings prior to the fourth century A.D.<a href="#Footnote14B"></a><a name="Footnote14A"> Footnote14</a> Ladd states that the word
was not applied to the astral deities until the third century A.D.<a href="#Footnote15B"></a><a name="Footnote15A"> Footnote15</a> If this is the case, this interpretation must be
seriously questioned because it depends upon a meaning for &quot;the elementary
principles&quot; which did not come into use until much later.</p>
<b>

<p align="CENTER">Religious Principles</p>
</b>

<p>Ridderbos, Ladd, Brown, Longenecker, Rendall and Delling<a href="#Footnote16B"></a><a name="Footnote16A"> Footnote16</a> interpret &quot;the elementary principles of the
world&quot; to refer to religion before and apart from Christ. Understanding &quot;the
elementary principles&quot; in the sense of &quot;rudimentary principles,&quot; it sees
Paul contrasting all religions in a negative light compared to the way to God opened by
Jesus Christ. Even Old Testament Judaism, which once had a limited validity, has now been
replaced by Christ. To return to it is to return to a state of inferior spiritual status
similar in some way to that of pagan idolatry.</p>

<p>This interpretation has the advantage of being able to apply to both Old Testament
Judaism and the Gentile religions and philosophies, a major problem with the two previous
interpretations. It also explains why even the Law is cast in a negative light. Apart from
the work of Christ which it foreshadowed, it too can lead only to slavery (see Gal.
3:22,23). Now that Christ has come, it is only a &quot;weak and worthless&quot; system
(Gal. 4:9), a mere shadow (Col. 2:17) that should be discarded. </p>

<p>This view, however, is not without problems. The biggest problem is that it 
  makes Paul designate even the Old Testament Law as &quot;of the world&quot; 
  (Gal. 4:3). He likewise seems to say in Col. 2:8 that the &quot;the elementary 
  principles of the world&quot; are synonymous with &quot;the traditions of men.&quot; 
  This runs counter to the divine origin of the Law. There are two different ways 
  in which scholars deal with this problem.</p>
<b>

<p align="CENTER">The Perversion of the Law</p>
</b>

<p>Ridderbos and Ladd contend that Paul is speaking of the perversion of the Old Testament
Law into a legalistic, humanistic system of justification and sanctification. These
scholars point out that both the Colossian heresy and the Judaizers in Galatia were in
fact perverting the Law into such a system. This would account for Paul's designation of
it as &quot;according to the traditions of men&quot; and &quot;of the world.&quot; Though
the Law was originated by God, its misuse originates from the world of fallen man. This
view would also make sense of Paul's description of all these systems as &quot;weak and
worthless&quot; (Gal.&nbsp;4:9).</p>

<p>The major problem with this view is that it does not deal adequately with the language
and context of Gal. 4:3-5. Here Paul teaches that he, other Jews and Jesus Himself were
all &quot;under the Law&quot; and &quot;under the elementary principles of the world&quot;
(he uses the terms interchangeably). While it may be argued that Paul and other Jews were
under a legalistic perversion of the Law, the same cannot be claimed for Jesus. He
definitely rejected the rabbinic interpretation of the Law as a means of righteousness and
refused to live under it in that way. Furthermore, the context of Gal. 3:19-23 uses the
phrase &quot;under the Law&quot; in the sense that it was accomplishing God's intended
purpose in shutting up all men under sin and thus preparing them for their Savior-Messiah
Jesus. In this author's opinion, these two problems render this view improbable.</p>
<b>

<p align="CENTER">The Outdated Law</p>
</b>

<p>Brown, Delling, Longenecker and Rendall insist that in addition to human philosophies
and religions, Paul is referring to the Old Testament Law in its proper sense. The Law was
valid because it foreshadowed the work of Christ and made people aware of their need for
forgiveness, but it is now no longer valid because the New Covenant for which it made
preparation has now come. </p>

<p>This view has several advantages. It clearly allows for the Jewish meaning of the
prescriptions of Col. 2:16,21 and Gal. 4:10. It allows for the obvious sense of the phrase
&quot;under the Law&quot; in Gal. 3:19-4:5. It explains why Paul can refer even to the Law
as &quot;weak and worthless&quot; because, as Heb. 7:18,19 says,
&quot;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;there is the setting aside of the former commandment
because of its weakness and uselessness (for the Law made nothing
perfect)&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&quot;</p>

<p>This view also explains why Paul can link the Law with human religions. What validity
the Old Testament Law once had is now gone since its fulfillment has come. To go back to a
impersonal religious system after a personal relationship with God is now possible through
the indwelling Holy Spirit is to go back to a state no better (in that sense) than
paganism (Gal. 4:6-11). While Paul stops short of calling the Law &quot;false&quot; in the
same sense as pagan religions, he insists that going under it as a Christian is a
reversion as serious as relapse into idolatry (Gal. 4:8-10).</p>

<p>The major problem with this view is the origin which Paul ascribes to these
&quot;elementary principles.&quot; In Col. 2:8, he appears to use the phrase &quot;the
traditions of men&quot; synonymously with &quot;the elementary principles of the
world.&quot; The same problem exists with the phrase &quot;of the world.&quot; While a
fitting description for pagan religions, both phrases imply a human origin for the Law,
even though Paul says elsewhere that it originates from God. </p>

<p>However, these problems can be resolved if one realizes that in both passages, Paul has
especially the ritual laws of Old Testament Judaism in view. Since these laws do not
relate directly to spiritual realities and had only a temporary, foreshadowing function,
they could be called &quot;of the world&quot; in the sense they pertain only to this
world.<a href="#Footnote17B"></a><a name="Footnote17A"> Footnote17</a> &quot;World&quot;
is being used, as Ladd suggests, as &quot;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the whole complex of
human earthly relationships&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;(which,
though)&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;not evil in itself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;can stand
between man and God.&quot;<a href="#Footnote18B"></a><a name="Footnote18A"> Footnote18</a>
</p>

<p>Upon closer observation, Col. 2:8 does not necessarily insist that the &quot;traditions
of men&quot; are synonymous with &quot;the elementary principles of the world.&quot; Paul
could be referring to two different sources of the Colossian heresy: the human
religio-philosophic source and the Old Testament ritual laws. At any rate, the grammar
does not demand that the two phrases are synonymous.<a href="#Footnote19B"></a><a name="Footnote19A"> Footnote19</a> In vs. 16-23, Paul would be referring primarily to the
(Old Testament) &quot;the elementary principles of the world,&quot; as indeed vs. 20
indicates.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the view that explains &quot;the elementary principles of the
world&quot;<i> </i>as pertaining to all religion (including the Old Testament Law and
especially its ritual system) before and outside of Christ is the most tenable position.</p>

<h3>Application</h3>

<p>Paul's usage of &quot;the elementary principles of the world&quot;<i> </i>obviously
warns against syncretism of the gospel with any other human philosophic or religious
system. This is the application most commonly pursued by preachers and expositors today.
But another important application of this phrase lies in the way Paul views Old Testament
ritual and the role of ritual in general.</p>
<b>

<p align="CENTER">Imposition of Old Testament Ritual</p>
</b>

<p>Clearly, these two passages warn against the imposition of Old Testament rituals on
Christians. It is not just looking to those rituals as a means of justification before God
that is condemned; the observance of them as a sign of &quot;spirituality&quot; is
inappropriate for the Christian because those rituals merely foreshadowed the
&quot;substance,&quot; or reality, which Christians now enjoy in the person and work of
Jesus. </p>

<p>It is true that Paul calls for patience with and even temporary deference to Christians
who do not yet understand the anachronism of Old Testament ritual law (Rom. 14; 1 Cor. 8).<a href="#Footnote20B"></a><a name="Footnote20A"> Footnote20</a> But note that he calls them
&quot;weak in faith;&quot; they need to grow in their understanding of their freedom in
Christ. On the other hand, those who already have that understanding<a href="#Footnote21B"></a><a name="Footnote21A"> Footnote21</a> are severely warned and censured for looking to Old
Testament ritual observance as a means of salvation or spiritual growth. The result of
this, Paul insists, will be <i>not</i> spiritual growth, but rather spiritual regression.</p>

<p>In view of these passages, it is difficult to understand how much of the church today
can defend its reliance on Old Testament ritual. Both direct and indirect implementation
of this ritual law pervades much of the church.<a href="#Footnote22B"></a><a name="Footnote22A"> Footnote22</a> Church members are told that such observances are
mandatory and that they constitute an essential (and in some cases, the primary)
expression of Christian spirituality. Paul completely denies the legitimacy of such
commands (Col. 2:16) and rejects the description of it as &quot;spirituality&quot; because
it has no power over the flesh (Col. 2:23). I believe that a proper application of these
passages would insist on an eradication of such practices from the church.</p>
<b>

<p align="CENTER">New Testament Ritualism</p>
</b>

<p>These two passages also warn in principle against the danger of ritualism even when the
rituals involved are prescribed by the New Testament. &quot;Ritualism&quot; is being used
here in the sense of making ritual observance a primary focus of the Christian life and
means of its expression. Water baptism and communion are the two rituals most often
employed in such &quot;New Testament&quot; ritualism, although foot-washing and other
practices are sometimes also included. </p>

<p>The Galatian passage in particular pits the religion of ritual observance against the
great privilege of personally relating to God through the agency of the Holy Spirit.
Ritualism was legitimate (even necessary) during the Old Testament economy because this
kind of personal relationship with God was not possible. But now God has made it possible
to relate to him as <i>Abba</i>. The work of Christ and the gift of the Holy Spirit have
made it possible for us to be adopted into God's family. To go back to relating to God
primarily through ritual observance is to reject God's assessment of this gift. This is
spiritual regression which is reprehensible enough to make Paul fear that he had labored
in vain (vs 11)!</p>

<p>While New Testament rituals remain a legitimate aspect of Christianity, ritualism as
the means of relating to God has been &quot;outgrown&quot; and rejected. This is also the
argument of the book of Hebrews (especially chapters 7-10). No church which focuses on
ritualism can claim to be a valid representation of Pauline Christianity. </p>

<p>It is important to note that the number of rituals prescribed by Jesus are very few
compared to the Old Testament economy. It is also noteworthy that the way in which these
rituals are to be observed is not explained in detail, again a sharp contrast to the Old
Testament period. Since we live in the period of fulfillment of salvation rather than in
the period of promise, ritual takes on a lesser role. This fact, together with Paul's
warning in Gal. 4:1-11, should teach Christians that ritual plays a relatively minor role
in their spiritual lives compared to their personal relationships with Christ.</p>

<p>Acts 21:24 - James wants Paul to take a Nazarite vow, thus showing the Jews that he
&quot;walks orderly (<i>stoicheis</i>), keeping the Law&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&quot;
Phil. 3:16 - Paul urges the Philippian Christians to &quot;keep living to that standard (<i>stoicheion</i>)
to which we have attained.&quot; Gal. 6:16 - Referring to the new creation, Paul says,
&quot;To those who walk by (<i>stoichesousin</i>) this rule, peace and mercy be upon
them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&quot; Gal. 5:25 - &quot;If we live by the Spirit, let us
also walk by (<i>stoichomen</i>) the Spirit.&quot; Rom. 4:12 - Specifying to whom the
promise was given, Paul says, &quot;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;those who follow in the
steps (<i>stoichousin</i>) of the faith of Abraham&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&quot;
Delling is careful to point out that <i>stoicheo</i> is not used synonymously with the
other verbs meaning &quot;to walk&quot;, but rather retains the stricter meaning of
&quot;to be closely regulated by. &quot; See Gerhard Friedrich, ed<i>. Theological

<p>The reference to &quot;food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a
Sabbath day&quot; in Col. 2:16 is definitely referring to Old Testament ritual law.
Likewise, in view of the historical background of Galatians, the phrase &quot;days and
months and seasons and years&quot; is an obvious reference to Old Testament ritual law.
For an <i>very</i> unconvincing denial of this, see R. Alan Cole, <i>Tyndale New Testament

<p>Both Col. 2:22 and Mk. 7:18,19 draw attention to the &quot;this-worldliness&quot;
temporality of the dietary Laws. Col. 2:17 implies the same &quot;this-worldly&quot;
status of the Old Testament religious calendar; it was only an earthly &quot;shadow&quot;
of the spiritual &quot;substance&quot; of Jesus.</p>

<p>I am aware that pagan superstition may have also been a part of the thinking of some
who were &quot;weak in faith&quot;. But especially Rom.&nbsp;14:5,6 imply a Jewish Sabbath

<p>Direct implementation includes viewing the church building as the &quot;house of
God&quot;, and instituting a clergy of &quot;priests&quot; who mediate between God and the
&quot;laity&quot; and employ washings. Indirect implementation includes the liturgical
calendar, liturgical worship services, and infant baptism when justified by appealing to
infant circumcision.</p>

      <h1>Basic Christianity </h1>
      <h2>Week One </h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Introduction </h3>
      <p>People today believe all kinds of things. It seems, in fact, that America 
        is a virtual &quot;belief cafeteria&quot; with faiths of every kind to 
        select from. The statistics show that while the majority of us identify 
        ourselves as &quot;Christian,&quot; most people do not believe some of 
        the most basic and essential biblical truths. Many of us are really confused 
        about spiritual things. </p>
      <p>Maybe we believe pretty much what the Bible teaches but don't really 
        understand our faith. This makes our faith shaky and unsatisfying. How 
        can we apply our faith to our lives if we don't have a deep grasp of what 
        it is? It would be like trying to build a bridge without a solid knowledge 
        of physics. No one in their right mind would chance crossing such a bridge. 
        It's odd that people take such great pains with their careers and other 
        interests, but so little with the things that matter most. And this brings 
        us to the next point.</p>
      <hr>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Importance of doctrine</i>. Truth matters. Just as there are consequences 
          to errors in engineering or science, so too there are consequences to 
          being wrong in the realm of spiritual truth. That's why Jesus said, 
          &quot;you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free&quot; 
          (John 8:32). And we note too, the Apostle Paul's warning, &quot;See 
          to it that no one take you captive through philosophy or empty deception&quot; 
          (Colossians 2:8). Here are three key reasons why doctrine is vital: 
          <ol>
            <li>Everyone needs answers to the &quot;big&quot; questions of life. 
              What happens to me when I die? Where did I come from? Is there a 
              God? How can I know God? 
              <ul>
                <li>Eternal issues are at stake. If the Bible is right, then the 
                  faith commitments a person makes in this life will determine 
                  their eternal destiny. Certainly, such ultimate and weighty 
                  concerns demand careful thinking through. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The kind of life we live is also affected by what we believe. 
              Jesus taught, &quot;I came that they might have life, and have it 
              abundantly&quot; (John 10:10). As we discover God's design for our 
              lives, and begin to live it out, we will find God's transforming 
              hand in our lives. The more we know about God, the more we will 
              be able to recognize his work in the world and in our lives. </li>
            <li>We have a built-in need for our lives to be vitally connected 
              to reality. We may pity the person whose life is in service to a 
              lie--the Nazi or the Hare Krishna. We may admire their dedication, 
              but realize that it is being wasted on falsehood. On the other hand, 
              when our lives are poured into true and deeply meaningful things, 
              it has a profoundly satisfying result: The best of our abilities 
              and personalities are brought out. Life has a real direction and 
              purpose. </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The role of doctrine is to clarify these issues. Doctrine lays out what 
        we could call the Christian <i>world view</i>. By world view, I mean the 
        essential truths of the Bible and how they answer the key questions of 
        life.</p>
      <hr>
      <ul>
        <li><i>How we arrive at doctrine</i>. Doctrine <i>systematizes</i> what 
          the Bible teaches. The Bible was written over a several hundred year 
          period by many authors in very different cultural settings. Yet the 
          important issues are consistently and clearly expressed. What the biblical 
          authors say about who God is, what it means to be human, how to be in 
          right relationship to God, and other key truths are stated repeatedly 
          throughout the scripture. Doctrine means taking these selections from 
          all over scripture and organizing them into subjects. This class is 
          an introduction to Bible doctrine. </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <h3>Who Am I? The Christian View of Human Nature </h3>
      <p><i>Then God said, 'Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness' 
        . . .And God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created 
        him; male and female He created them</i> (Genesis 1:26,27). </p>
      <p>This is a very different starting point for human nature than what we 
        are taught to think. When we think about human origins, we tend to think 
        about evolution. The basic idea is that the human species is the product 
        of a long process of biological change, based on the &quot;survival of 
        the fittest.&quot; According to evolutionary theory, there is no purpose 
        for human life. We are here by evolutionary chance. We can not say that 
        there is anything essentially unique or valuable about the human species 
        in general, or about each one of us in particular. Nature is indifferent 
        to our search for meaning, because nature itself serves no ultimate purpose.</p>
      <hr>
      <h5>The dignity of man </h5>
      <p><i>What is man, that You take thought of him? And the son of man, that 
        You care for him? Yet You have made him a little lower than God, and crowned 
        him with glory and majesty!</i> Psalm 8:4,5. </p>
      <hr>
      <p>In contrast, the Bible places great value in human life. We are uniquely 
        &quot;the image of God.&quot; We are both physical and spiritual. There 
        is something very special about each of us, according to the Bible. </p>
      <h5>What does it mean to be in the &quot;image of God?&quot;</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Gen. 1:27. <i>Benevolent rulership</i>. Adam is entrusted with a stewardship 
          of nature. Other species adapt to the environment. Man is to care for 
          it. Just as God rules creation, he has entrusted to man the responsibility 
          to care for the environment. </li>
        <li>Gen. 2:15. <i>Creative accomplishment</i>. Adam is to cultivate the 
          ground. He is to make things useful for human purposes. As God is creative, 
          so is man. 
          <ul>
            <li>Art, literature, music; these are aspects of human uniqueness. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Gen. 2:16,17. <i>Free Will</i>. Humans are not biologically determined 
          automatons. We are free to make choices that guide our lives. 
          <ul>
            <li>Genuine freedom entails the possibility of making significant 
              <i>moral</i> choices. Only humans are responsible for their actions. 
              We do not blame animals for what they do. We acknowledge that it 
              comes naturally to them. But for man, freedom means both the extraordinary 
              opportunity to chart our own course and the liability of being held 
              accountable for these choices. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Gen. 2:18. <i>Social</i>. The ability to experience love relationships 
          is essential to personhood. When we really think about what motivates 
          us, and what brings out the best in us, it is tied to our social nature. 
          <ul>
            <li>The greatest examples of human virtue are people who gave all 
              they had to serve others. </li>
            <li>A vital life quest is for people to love. Certainly this is true 
              in the romantic sense--finding a mate to enjoy a life of love together. 
              Think about all of the songs, art, music you know. Isn't it primarily 
              about this quest? God's design is for lasting, stable love relationships. 
            </li>
            <li>No man is an island. We are social beings by nature. In fact, 
              the family, which is the basic social unit is where we learn to 
              communicate, where we adopt our values, and the survival skills 
              that will take us through life. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Gen. 2:19,20. <i>Intellectual</i>. We have a built in need to understand 
          the world around us. We want to learn, not merely for the sake of survival, 
          but simply to understand. 
          <ul>
            <li>We see the intense curiosity of children as evidence of this. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Gen. 1:28, 2:24. <i>Sexual</i>. Sex is not a sin, nor is it the cause 
          of all evils. Sex expresses the joining of two people in the most intimate 
          way. It both preserves personal diversity and distills unity. In this 
          respect, sex reflects God's intimate unity in the trinity. </li>
        <li>Gen. 2:25. <i>Open</i>. As the creation narrative ends, man is in 
          harmony with God and with each other. Adam and Eve are not ashamed of 
          who they are. Their identities are secure and they can be completely 
          vulnerable. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>So this is how God designed humans &quot;in his image&quot; to be. Yet, 
        we know from our own experience that it's not that way now. There is another 
        side to human nature.</p>
      <hr>
      <h5>Human depravity </h5>
      <p><i>The heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick. 
        Who can understand it? </i>Jeremiah 17:9. </p>
      <p><i>And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, 'From any tree of the 
        garden you may eat freely; but from the tree of the knowledge of good 
        and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you shall 
        surely die' </i>Genesis 2:16,17.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Most people believe the biblical view about human dignity. We recognize 
        something of value about human beings that we don't see in anything else. 
        Yet, everyone recognizes that there are problems with man. Secular people 
        typically believe that people are basically good. If every one were properly 
        educated and had their basic needs met, there would be no problems in 
        the world. Problems people have is a result of what is done to them, not 
        something that originates within them. Sometimes this view is called &quot;humanism.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>On the other hand, the Bible teaches that there is something fundamentally 
        wrong within us. People are not &quot;basically good,&quot; and our core 
        problem is not something that has been done to us by others. We are inherently 
        <i>valuable</i>, but not inherently <i>good</i>. The essential flaw in 
        our nature results from what the Bible calls &quot;the fall.&quot; While 
        human beings maintain the dignity of sharing in the image of God, the 
        image is distorted, corrupted. 
      <ul>
        <li>Genesis 3:1-6. 
          <ul>
            <li>God placed the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the garden 
              as a tangible opportunity to exercise freedom to reject God. The 
              tree is the opportunity to say no to God. But it is not because 
              God is uptight that he told Adam And Eve not to eat, but because 
              he knows what is good for us. <i>Autonomous</i>, self-directed will 
              has catastrophic consequences.

                  own navigation. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Consequences of the fall. 
              <ul>
                <li>Gen. 3:7. <i>Psychological alienation</i>. Adam and Eve were 
                  no longer comfortable or secure with themselves. They could 
                  not be vulnerable before each other. </li>
                <li>Gen. 3:8,9. <i>Theological alienation</i>. No longer confident 
                  in their standing before God. They recognized the barrier of 
                  sin that they erected by their disobedience. No longer will 
                  they have direct access to God. 
                  <ul>
                    <li>Universal human awareness that man and God are alienated. 
                      That's what all religions of the world are based on. They 
                      may see God differently, and even view the human dilemma 
                      differently from the Bible, but they all acknowledge the 
                      fundamental rift between man and God. </li>
                    <li>Colossians 2:14. The Certificate of Debt. </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Gen. 3:12. <i>Social alienation</i>. Unity between Adam and 
                  Eve was shattered. Rather than seeing his mate as a compliment 
                  to himself, Adam blamed her for his choice. Perhaps this is 
                  the most significant outward sign of the fall. War, divorce, 
                  breakdown of community and family attest to the distorted and 
                  corrupt social nature of man. 
                  <ul>
                    <li>Quote Alan Bloom, Closing of the American Mind, p. 118, 
                      124. See also study cited in <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, &quot;Kids 
                      pay toll of broken home, study says.&quot; </li>
                    <li>Most people's lives revolve around the desires of self. 
                      &quot;Looking out for #1&quot; is really what its all about. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Human sexuality has been transformed from a celebration 
                      of unity to self-seeking pleasure and exploitation. </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Gen. 17,18. <i>Ecological alienation</i>. Previously cultivation 
                  was easy, now it is with great toil that the crop would be harvested. 
                  <ul>
                    <li>Man's stewardship of the environment is distorted. The 
                      current ecological crisis gives sharp testimony to how irresponsible 
                      we are with nature. </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Gen. 3:19. <i>Death</i>. Ultimately, the fall means death 
                  to all people. 
                  <ul>
                    <li>Death is not natural. We were not created to die. Paul 
                      refers to death as &quot;the enemy&quot; in I Corinthians 
                      15. In John 11, Jesus wept at the tomb of his friend Lazarus. 
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>So the greatness of man is corrupted by the fall. We maintain the image 
        of God, but in all of the areas of human dignity, a pervasive element 
        of distortion remains.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Under God's Judgment </h3>
      <p><i>For the wages of sin is death. . .</i>Romans 6:23</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Clearly, we can not think of a less popular idea. Most people no longer 
        believe in a &quot;judging God.&quot; This is true for basically two reasons. 
        First, we don't think that sin is quite that serious. Second, we don't 
        think the idea of a loving God is consistent with God judging. So lets 
        delve into this more fully. 
      <ul>
        <li><i>Sliding scales</i>. Most of the time when we think about moral 
          evil--the kind worthy of God's judgment--people like Hitler come to 
          mind. No one would claim the self-righteous position of sinlessness. 
          But the thinking is that most of us are not <i>too</i> bad. Most of 
          the time we're honest, hard working people. We don't hurt other people 
          and would never think about doing the really terrible things Hitler 
          and others have done. So we tend to see two different kinds of &quot;sinners.&quot; 
          The real serious ones, deserving of hell, and the rest of us. 
          <ul>
            <li>But let's think about what this view really means. Some sinners 
              are worthy of God's judgment, but others aren't. Where do we draw 
              the line? How much sin is too much sin? In the final account, doesn't 
              it make a mockery of God's moral character. The fact is that we 
              are all in the same situation: &quot;All have sinned and fallen 
              short of the glory of God&quot; (Rom. 3:23). 
              <ul>
                <li>Illustration of swimmers going from LA to Hawaii </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What really are God's moral requirements? (James 2:10). Part of 
              many people's confusion about moral guilt comes from appealing to 
              current social standards of ethics, rather than biblical ones. 
              <ul>
                <li><i>Matthew 22:36-40</i>. Now it is clear that we simply don't 
                  live up to this standard. The person who thinks that they are 
                  &quot;basically good&quot; don't define goodness the way Jesus 
                  does. They think they are good because they don't do certain 
                  obvious evils. But as for the motivations of the heart, and 
                  a life of sacrificial love on behalf of others, it is sheer 
                  foolishness and self-delusion to think that we are righteous 
                  on these terms. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <ul>
        <li><i>A loving God won't judge</i>. How could a loving God send anyone 
          to hell? This is something I've struggled with quite a bit. I wonder 
          about those who didn't get a clear, relevant presentation of the gospel 
          like I did. And I think about the fact that eternal punishment is an 
          awfully big sentence for what most people do. So what do we do about 
          this? 
          <ol>
            <li><i>Those who haven't heard the gospel?</i> 
              <ul>
                <li>Some are innocent because they lack the ability to grasp their 
                  moral state. See 2 Samuel 12:23. </li>
                <li>Romans 1:18-23; 2:14-1618; Luke 18:9ff. Natural revelation 
                  gives everyone reasonable and intuitive awareness of the human 
                  condition. </li>
                <li>We are responsible for responding in faith to what God <i>has</i> 
                  revealed to us (Gen. 15:6). Abraham did not know the full plan 
                  of God. He only knew that God was calling him, and that he should 
                  act in obedience. </li>
                <li>So why evangelize? Because what intuition a person has gets 
                  lost and distorted in false religion. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><i>Eternal punishment for finite sins</i>. How is the punishment 
              fitting the crime here? 
              <ul>
                <li>1 Tim. 2:3,4. God's desire is that all be saved. </li>
                <li>Heb. 9:27. We are given a finite amount of time to make a 
                  decision of permanent consequence. </li>
                <li>What would be the appropriate sentence? The point is not a 
                  fixed number of years for a particular offense. Rather, the 
                  issue is whether or not we will humble ourselves to receive 
                  forgiveness. Jesus said, &quot;He who is not for me is against 
                  me&quot; (Mt. 12:30). War time analogy fits in here. The issue 
                  is not the number of sins, but where we have our allegiance. 
                  We have a limited time to decide. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><i>What if God does not judge?</i> In what sense does this preserve 
              his basic goodness? Think about it just a minute. If God does not 
              intend to hold anyone responsible for their lives, then God is ultimately 
              responsible. Further, what would eternity with an unrepentant Hitler 
              be like? Could this be heaven? What is the difference between heaven 
              and hell at this point? </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>So human beings are in a very bad situation. As Isaiah illustrates, &quot;all 
        of us like sheep have gone astray&quot; (Isaiah 53:6). An absolute moral 
        being must impose consequences on human sin. To overlook our cruelty is 
        not loving. But God has a solution. </p>
      <hr>
      <h3>God's Solution </h3>
      <p><i>But when the fullness of time came, God sent forth His Son. . .</i>Galatians 
        4:4</p>
      <hr>
      <p>God is omniscient. That means he knows everything--including the future. 
        Even before he created us, he knew what was going to happen. So he decided 
        on a plan to deal with man's rebellion. We see his plan unfolding through 
        the pages of scripture. In fact, that's really what the Bible is: the 
        revelation of God's plan for fallen humanity.

      <p>Often, people think that the essence of Jesus' teaching was moral: Sermon 
        on the Mount, for example. In reality, the overwhelming emphasis of Jesus' 
        teaching was about his death and resurrection. 
      <ul>

        <li>John 1:29; Hebrews 10:12. Christ is the fulfillment of sacrificial 
          system. 
          <ul>
            <li>Because Christ is eternal and sinless, he could substitute for

      <h3>Saving Faith </h3>
      <p><i>But to as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become 
        children of God, even to those who believe in His name.</i> John 1:12.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Salvation is offered by God as a gift. That's what <i>grace</i> means--not 
        something you say before dinner. But he will not force us to take his 
        offer. We must exercise faith. But what does this mean? 
      <ul>
        <li>Faith means <i>agreeing</i> with God about our need for forgiveness 
          and the adequacy of his provision in Christ. 
          <ul>
            <li>This means acknowledging that we in no way earn God's acceptance. 
              See Ephesians 2:8,9. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Faith means making a conscious <i>decision</i> to trust Christ's death 
          on our behalf. 
          <ul>
            <li>Wheelbarrow analogy </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is what it means to be right with God. We simply humble ourselves 
        to receive what we could never earn. God wants us to be confident in our 
        standing before him. Once the issue of forgiveness is out of the way, 
        we are restored to permanent fellowship with God (Ephesians 1:13,14). 
      </p>
      <p>Receiving new life in Jesus Christ is where it all begins. In the third 
        week we will discuss in detail how God works in our lives as believers.

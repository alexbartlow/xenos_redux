<h3><big>Teaching Goals for Book 1</big></h3>

<p class="style1"><big>Before we can move into the particulars of biblical teaching on the church and our
role in it, we have to understand correctly what the church is. </big></p>

<p class="style1"><big><b>In this book we will be studying:</b> </big>
<ol class="style1">
  <li><big>The origin of the church and its relationship to the Old Covenant. </big></li>
  <li><big>The use of the word &quot;church&quot; as it applies to the universal and local
    church. </big></li>
  <li><big>The pattern of church government, or leadership in the early church. </big></li>
</ol>

<p class="style1"><big>Later, we will be studying why these areas are important to church life today. </big></p>

<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="style1"><big>The foundational question in formulating our doctrine of the church is: Which part
of the Bible will we use? Should we use the material in the Old Testament? What about the
gospels? Our answer to these questions have a number of important implications, as we will
soon see. </big></p>

<p class="style1"><big>Our answer to this question depends on our understanding of <i>when the church
began</i>. </big></p>

<p class="style1"><big>Protestants have tended to answer this question in two basic ways: Some define the
church as comprising all believers from Adam on. Accordingly, they feel the freedom to
include some of the Old Testament material in their understanding of the church. This is
also the position of Roman Catholicism. Others define the church as comprising all
Christians from <b>Pentecost</b> on. They therefore see the church as a distinct program
from Israel. According to these, the primary biblical materials which define the church
are Jesus' explicit teaching on the church (e.g., Mt. 16:18; 18:17; 28:18-20), Acts, the
epistles, and Rev. 1-3. </big></p>

<p class="style1"><big>Those who believe the church began on the day of Pentecost justify their idea from
Scripture following way: </big>
<ol class="style1">
  <li><big>The church is Christ's body. (Col. 1:18) </big></li>
  <li><big>The baptism by the Holy Spirit is the means by which believers in Christ are
    incorporated into his body. (1 Cor. 12:13) </big></li>
  <li><big>The baptism by the Holy Spirit began on the day of Pentecost after Christ's
    resurrection. (Acts 1:5; 2:1-4; 11:15-17) </big></li>
  <li><big>Therefore, the church began on the day of Pentecost after Christ's resurrection. </big></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2 class="style1"><big>Confusing the Old Covenant and the church</big></h2>

<p class="style1"><big>Because some churches feel the freedom to use Old Covenant material in their
understanding of the church, they have an inherent tendency to incorporate Old Covenant
structures into church life. Consider the following examples. </big></p>

<h4 class="style1"><big>Tabernacle/Temple</big></h4>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Past Purpose</b>: The tabernacle was a prophetic picture of God's intent to
dwell in his people; his presence dwelt in the building in a unique way. The symbolic
events conducted in the tabernacle explained why God could not indwell his people (because
of their sins) and how he would one day overcome this problem (by making atonement for
their sins through his chosen substitute). </big></p>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Present Error</b>: Now this prophetic picture has been fulfilled. God dwells in
every Christian and in the church corporately; the church is the temple of God. (1 Cor.
3:16; Eph. 2:20-22; 1 Pet. 2:4,5) Thus, it is no longer proper to regard any building as
the place where God dwells in a special way. </big></p>

<h6 class="style1"><big>Discussion:</big></h6>

<p class="style1"><big>What effects would we expect from this error? </big></p>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Possible Answers</b>: Most people view the church as a building rather than the
people indwelt by God. Many people superstitiously believe the church building (or the
sanctuary therein) is &quot;God's house&quot; in that his presence is localized there more
so than anywhere else. For this reason, people often speak in hushed tones when entering a
sanctuary, even when no one else is there! Parents tell children not to run or play in the
sanctuary because &quot;this is God's house.&quot; Not only does this suggest God is
anti-fun; it also communicates that God is still unable to indwell us personally as we
come to him through Christ. </big></p>

<h4 class="style1"><big>Priesthood</big></h4>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Past Purpose</b>: The high priest was a type of Christ. (Heb. 3:1; 4:14) For
this reason, he alone was permitted to enter into God's presence with a sacrifice for the
people's sins. The other priests were a type of Christians in that they could draw near to
God and communicate the knowledge of God to the people. The rest of the people were
essentially passive participants in the service of God. </big></p>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Present Error</b>: This clergy-laity distinction which was valid in the Old
Covenant period is now invalid. Because of Jesus' sacrifice, all believers have equal
access to God and equal privilege to communicate the knowledge of God to others. ((Heb.
10:19-22; 1 Pet. 2:9) </big></p>

<h6 class="style1"><big>Discussion:</big></h6>

<p class="style1"><big>What effects would we expect from this error? </big></p>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Possible Answers</b>: The effect of the clergy-laity distinction has usually
been to discourage unordained Christians from ministering in significant ways. Church
members often think it is the minister's job to reach out to others, teach the Bible, give
spiritual counsel, etc. With no significant ministry purpose to pursue, many church
members by default become enmeshed in materialism, which offers a counterfeit
significance. This is a tragic squandering of the resources of the church. </big></p>

<h4 class="style1"><big>Sabbath and Festival Calendar</big></h4>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Past Purpose</b>: God gave the Israelites a full calendar of &quot;holy&quot;
days. The Sabbath and the prescribed festivals were largely prophetic pictures of the
salvation which Jesus would accomplish. (Col. 2:16,17) </big></p>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Present Error</b>: Now that Christ has paid for our sins, every day is holy in
the sense that salvation has occurred once and for all. Paul makes it clear in Rom. 14:1-5
that only those Christians who are &quot;weak in faith&quot; ascribe intrinsic spiritual
significance to the observance of the Sabbath. In Gal. 4:1-11, he says that Christians who
go back to observing the festival calendar are regressing rather than progressing
spiritually. </big></p>

<h6 class="style1"><big>Discussion:</big></h6>

<p class="style1"><big>What effects would we expect from this error? </big></p>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Possible Answers</b>: Many people erroneously believe that what matters to God
is that we go to church on Sundays, or at least on Christmas and Easter. The effect of
this formalistic approach to God is to reinforce the impression that an impersonal
relationship with God is what he desires. </big></p>

<h4 class="style1"><big>Liturgical Worship Service</big></h4>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Past Purpose</b>: The Old Covenant worship of God was highly ritualistic. This
was because it was designed to be an elaborate predictive picture of the work of Christ.
(Heb. 8:5) The content and order of this ritual observance was highly regulated because it
taught that we must come to God in the way he prescribed - by faith in his Substitute. </big></p>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Present Error</b>: Now that these pictures have been fulfilled, they are
obsolete. (Heb. 8:13) Not only does the New Testament not describe or command a worship
service for the church; there is also a positive reinterpretation of this whole concept
(see section on &quot;Worship in the New Testament&quot;). Also, the number of prescribed
rituals has been drastically reduced (from hundreds to two) and the regulation of how to
observe them has been minimized. </big></p>

<h6 class="style1"><big>Discussion:</big></h6>

<p class="style1"><big>What effects would we expect from this error? </big></p>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Possible Answers</b>: Those who subscribe to the necessity of liturgical
worship invariably communicate an impersonal relationship with God when the way is now
open to have an intensely personal relationship with him. Also, it is all too easy to
continue to observe ritual even when the reality of the relationship is not there. This is
why we have so many ritualistic churches today where the members do not know God
personally. This ritualism is a turn-off to those who long for personal contact with God. </big></p>

<h4 class="style1"><big>Infant Circumcision</big></h4>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Past Purpose</b>: Infant circumcision was a ritual given by God to Abraham and
his physical descendents. (Gen. 17:9-14) Circumcision was to be the sign that Israel was
God's people. It was also a symbol of their need to be liberated from the bondage of their
sin- natures. (Deut. 10:16; Jer. 4:4) God predicted that when Messiah came, he would
&quot;circumcise your heart . . . to love the Lord your God.&quot; (Deut. 30:6) </big></p>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Present Error</b>: The symbolism of physical circumcision has fulfilled in the
death of Christ through which he disarmed the authority of our sin natures. (Col. 2:11) In
spite of the fact that all clear examples of baptism in the New Testament are adult
believers, many churches see infant baptism as the church's counterpart to infant
circumcision. Roman Catholic doctrine states that it removes the guilt of original sin,
thus teaching that spiritual regeneration comes through baptism. Many Protestant
denominations erroneously believe that passages like Rom. 6:4 and Col. 2:11 refer to water
baptism, and thus almost seem to teach baptismal regeneration. </big></p>

<h6 class="style1"><big>Discussion:</big></h6>

<p class="style1"><big>What effects would we expect from this error? </big></p>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Possible Answers</b>: When asked if they will go to heaven, people commonly
answer &quot;yes&quot; because they were baptized as infants. Infant baptism has the
effect of de- emphasizing the necessity of personal conversion to Christ. Instead, it
communicates that salvation is something entered into on the basis of parental decision or
ritual observance. This is a formalistic definition of Christianity which leads to whole
churches full of nominal Christians (in name only). </big></p>

<h4 class="style1"><big>Emphasis on the Law</big></h4>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Past Purpose</b>: The Old Testament law code was a national contract with
Israel which stipulated the conditions by which they could enjoy the land of Canaan. (see
Deut. 28) It also had a spiritual value in that it showed them their need for God's grace
which would be given when Messiah came. (Gal. 3:22-25) For both of these reasons, it was
entirely proper for Israel to have a &quot;law emphasis.&quot; </big></p>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Present Error</b>: The church is not a national entity living in Canaan, but an
international community. Furthermore, now that Christ has come, we have access to new
ministries of the Holy Spirit, making it possible for us to serve &quot;in the newness of
the Spirit rather than the oldness of the letter.&quot; (Rom. 7:6) The emphasis of the
church should therefore be on the good news of God's grace, not on the Law and the threat
of God's judgment. </big></p>

<h6 class="style1"><big>Discussion:</big></h6>

<p class="style1"><big>What effects would we expect from this error? </big></p>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Answers</b>: Many denominations emphasize the Ten Commandments more than the
grace of God. The effect is that many people grow up with the view that God is primarily a
God of judgment rather than a God of love who has provided a way to forever escape his
judgment. Some respond to this emphasis by running from God altogether; others become
self-righteous. In either case, the unchurched person does not get the impression that
Christianity is about the grace of God. </big></p>

<h4 class="style1"><big>Outreach Strategy</big></h4>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Past Purpose</b>: God's strategy for reaching Gentiles in the Old Testament
period was centripetal. As the Israelites stayed in the land and followed the Law, God
granted them national security and material prosperity. Foreigners would notice this, and
some would thus adopt YHWH as their God. (Deut. 28:7-14; 1 Kings 10:1-12) The main reason
for this &quot;stay in the land&quot; strategy was that the Holy Spirit was not operative
in the same way he is today, so the Israelites needed to be a separate culture to prevent
complete apostasy. </big></p>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Present Error</b>: Since the coming of the Holy Spirit, the God's outreach
strategy has changed from centripetal (&quot;stay in the land&quot;) to centrifugal
(&quot;go into all the world&quot; - see Mt. 28:18; Acts 1:8). God's people are no longer
to be a distinct culture, but rather are commanded identify culturally with those that
they seek to reach (1 Cor. 9:19-23). Also, whereas material blessing was at times a
legitimate national indication of Israel's obedience to God (although see Deut.
8:11-14;31:20; Prov. 30:8,9; Neh. 9:25.26; Hos. 13:6), this is not the case in the church
(see 1 Cor. 4:9-16; Rev. 3:14-19). </big></p>

<h6 class="style1"><big>Discussion:</big></h6>

<p class="style1"><big>What effects would we expect from this error? </big></p>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Possible Answers</b>: Churches commonly emphasize &quot;witnessing by your
lifestyle&quot; instead of teaching that every Christian is to actively reach out to the
lost through verbal evangelism as well as through an attractive lifestyle. Many churches
also have developed their own sub-culture which effectively isolates them from
non-Christians. In addition, many churches affirm the Old Covenant view of wealth and thus
passively (or even actively) condone materialism. These features are clearly at odds with
God's present strategy. </big></p>

<h4 class="style1"><big>Relationship Between Church and State</big></h4>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Past Purpose</b>: In the Old Testament the nation of Israel was both a
spiritual and national entity. The government of Israel was originally a theocracy,
eventually replaced by a theocratic-chosen king. God needed a nation where he could
preserve the witness he was accumulating about himself. It was entirely in order for God
to call on the government of ancient Israel to operate the nation in a just and godly way.
</big></p>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Present Error</b>: In the New Testament, the church is not expected to function
as a nation state. On the contrary, the program is clearly different as witnessed by the
call to submit to, and obey the Roman government--one of the most godless and brutal
governments in history. (Rom. 13:1) The New Testament is devoid of any call to take over
society or to run society God's way. Unfortunately, many Bible interpreters continue to
read the Covenantal promises and warnings addressed to Israel in the Old Testament as
though they apply either to the church, or to the United States (or other countries). <br>
</big></p>

<p class="style1"><big>A very common example of this confusion is the often quoted passage in 2
Chronicles 7:13 &quot;If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command
the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among My people, and My people who
are called by My name humble themselves and pray, and seek My face and turn from their
wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin, and will heal their
land.&quot; It is a mistake to apply this passage to the United States? It refers to the
cursing/blessing section in the book of Deuteronomy. The people who are called by God's
name are Israel. There is in fact no such promise extended to other countries. <br>
</big></p>

<p class="style1"><big>One qualification is needed on this point. In the ancient world, there was no
opportunity to vote on government issues or candidates. We do not know what God would have
said if there was. Probably, a good ethical case can be made for Christian activism in
politics as long as it falls short of attempts to establish a Christian state. </big></p>

<h6 class="style1"><big>Discussion:</big></h6>

<p class="style1"><big>What effects would we expect from this error? </big></p>

<p class="style1"><big><b>Possible Answers</b>: History is full of examples of catastrophic results when
the church has concluded that it is to run the state. A nation state often has to operate
in the area of compulsion, punishment and even war. All of these things are inappropriate
for the church. The church needs to keep crystal clear loyalties, excluding any
non-biblical insertion into Christian doctrine. <br>
</big></p>

<p class="style1"><big>Manipulators use values similar or even identical to those in the Bible to get
Christians to back their agendas. For instance, no two themes are more universal in world
religions than the sanctity of the family and the sacredness of the given
cultural-national heritage. Oriental religion often actually worships parents and
ancestors. Islam views the state as expressly a religious entity. Most oral religions are
one and the same as the government of the tribe. This has tended to be true of
Christianity as well in Europe. The medieval church was convinced that the state was to
operate under the spiritual authority of the church. <br>
</big></p>

<p class="style1"><big>Linking the universal appeal of blood and soil values with patriotic values and
religion leads to the formation of a civil religion which is sometimes only nominally
Christian. For instance, the implication of a prominent evangelical leading whole football
stadiums in prayer before games is clear- -all or most of those present must be
Christians. It is easy to see why people begin to believe that Christianity is synonymous
with American citizenship or church membership. <br>
</big></p>

<p class="style1"><big>This nominal Christianity is one of the most deadly threats to real Christianity
for two reasons. In the first place, it causes people to believe that they are Christians
when they are not, and secondly, it misrepresents Christianity to the secular world.
Instead of seeing real vibrant spiritual living on the part of the church, society sees a
Christianity that is plagued by confusion and mediocrity. <br>
</big></p>

<p class="style1"><big>Francis Schaeffer has argued, &quot;If there are no absolutes by which to judge
society, then society is absolute.&quot; Francis Schaeffer, How Shall We Then Live? (Old
Tappan NJ: Fleming H Revell Company, 1976), p. 224. What does this statement mean, and do
you agree with it? What absolute should judge the state, and what if the majority don't
agree with that absolute? Should the Bible dictate morality even to non-Christians? </big></p>

<h3 class="style1"><big>Conclusion</big></h3>

<p class="style1"><big>From these examples we can see why it matters what biblical material we use in
constructing our understanding of the church! If we answer this question wrongly, we are
far more likely to go astray in setting the whole tone for what Christianity is like. </big></p>

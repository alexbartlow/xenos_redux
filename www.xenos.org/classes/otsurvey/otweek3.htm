</ul>

<p>&nbsp; 

<ul>
  <li>Why the ban? The ban raises significant questions in the mind of most readers. Could the
    God of grace and mercy really demand such extraordinary measures? It conjures up images of
    Cambodia under the Khamir Rouge, and solidifies the impression that the God of the Old
    Testament is a wrathful God, in sharp contrast to the God of the New Testament. Let's take
    a closer look at the legislation and the Canaanite culture.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Canaanite culture, like all of the cultures of the ANE, centered around its religion. By
      all standards of comparison, the Canaanite religion was enormously dehumanizing.</li>
  </ul>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>El was the primary god of the Canaanite pantheon. He is a creator god. Creation occurs
      by sexual procreation with female deities. Thus, worship of El takes on sexual form.
      Priestesses were essentially sex slaves of the cult.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Ba'al or Hadad. Son of El. He was the head of the Canaanite pantheon. He was younger and
        more virile than El. He is the god of rain, and therefore, like El, tied to fertility.</li>
      <li>Annat, wife of Astarti. Very similar to Kali of India. She was the goddess of sex, war
        and fertility. She is both sensuous and dangerous. She is a sacred prostitute for the
        gods, terms, &quot;holy one.&quot; Shown riding naked on a lion with a flower in one hand
        and a serpent in the other. She delights in blood. A very violent and fickle goddess.
        Human heads form a necklace in depictions of her. There was both the practice of ritual
        prostitution and human sacrifice to Annat and El.</li>

    </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Revelation of God to the Canaanites. The annihilation of Canaanite cities occurred after
    many years of rejecting the revelation God gave them.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Gen. 15:16. God would not give the land to Abraham, because the &quot;iniquity of the
      Amorite was not yet complete.&quot; That is, they had not, as a culture, gone beyond the
      point at which they could respond to God.</li>
    <li>The Canaanites had witnessed the willingness of God to judge those who resisted him
      personally on several occasions. E.g.: Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 19). Also,
      Josh. 2:10-14 makes it clear that 40 years prior to it's destruction, Jericho know of
      God's deliverance from Egypt. </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Conquest was judgment on the <i>culture</i>. The intent of the ban was that, &quot;they
    might not teach detestable things&quot; (Deut. 20:18). It must be recognized that the
    failure to complete the conquest set the stage in later generations, under the era of the
    judges, for a resurgence of Canaanite religion, with its devastating consequences for
    Israel. (see Judges 2:1-3, 10-15, 19-23).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Judgment on a culture is not the same as god's eternal judgment on all of the
      individuals within the society. Those who were unable to make moral choices or comprehend
      what the culture stood for would not be held accountable before God (see 2 Sam. 12:22).</li>
    <li>While God used the Hebrews as his instrument in judging the Canaanites, it does not
      follow that the Hebrews are characterized as meriting the land (Deut. 7:7-11). The land
      was given simply because God is faithful to his promises.</li>
    <li>God does not delight in the destruction of any person or culture. He executes temporal
      judgment only when his greater redemptive plan requires it. See, for example Jonah 3:4-10.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Historicity of the conquest. According to biblical chronology, the conquest began in
    about 1400 BC. According to archaeological excavation of Tell el-Sultan (Jericho), level
    4, Egyptian pottery from the 15th century BC has been found. Further, of the 150,000
    pieces of pottery recovered from this level, none dates to later than 1400 BC. There is no
    evidence of Mycenaean pottery at this level either. This is significant, because other
    finds have shown that after 1400 BC, there are extensive caches of Mycenaean pottery in
    the area. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Amarna Tablets. Series of correspondences between petty kings of Canaan seeking military
      assistance from Egypt. The names of the kings match the narrative of kings and cities in
      Joshua. We know the tablets to have been written between 1400-1370 BC. The tablets speak
      of an invading people, called the &quot;habiru.&quot; Many scholars link this term to the
      Israelites (Egypt's Seti I and Ramses II identify the Habiru with the Hebrews in their
      later conquest of Bethshan c. 1310 BC).</font></li>

<p></i><em>Israel: 1377-1055 BC</em><i></p>
</i></b>

<p>&quot;Judges&quot; is the history of this era. The thesis for this 300 year era of
Israel's history is summarized in Judges 2:11-22. The main theme can be viewed as a <i>cycle
</i>described in this passage: </p>

<p><img src="../../graphics/apostcyc.gif" alt="apostcyc.gif (3270 bytes)" WIDTH="519" HEIGHT="191"> 

<ul>
  <li>v.11-13. Israel serves the Baals. This is referred to as &quot;playing the harlot.&quot;
    The &quot;people of God's own possession&quot; rejected their relationship to God, and
    turned to serve Canaanite gods.</li>
  <li>v.14,15. God withdraws his protection from Israel in response to their apostasy. He
    gives them into the hands of &quot;plunderers who plunder them.&quot; The land is
    occupied; the people are scattered and often slaughtered.</li>
  <li>v.16-18. God raised up judges to rule over Israel. During the rule of the judge, the
    enemy would be repelled and the people restored to their land.</li>
  <li>v 19. After the death of the judge, the people would return to their apostate ways.</li>
</ul>
<i>

<p></i>Who were these judges? Judges were God's primary instrument to rule the people
during this era who were no longer obedient to the Law. 

<ul>
  <li>Judges brought about conformity to the Law and destroyed alters of worship to Canaanite
    gods. </li>
  <li>Judges were political leaders. They led primarily as a military leader. </li>
  <li>Judges were called by God. They were not appointed by the people. The people of Israel
    rewarded them and their families with large shares of land and often cash gifts. Most
    importantly, they were given the Spirit of God to enable them to be God's instrument
    (3:10). It was God who raised up the judges, because the nation was a
    &quot;theocracy.&quot; There was no central government. Unlike a king, the judge led
    solely by charisma. They had no legal power. They could not enforce taxes or raise an army
    by draft. They had no political power to act autonomously. They had only moral and
    spiritual leadership. The Spirit would come upon them and they would be able to accomplish
    God's will.</li>
</ul>
<i>

<p></i>Postscript: The end of the era of the judges. 

<ul>
  <li>Concluding comment from Judges. Things are not well for Israel. There is substantial
    tribal suspicion that has weakened Israel spiritually and militarily. The nation was
    verging on moral anarchy. Note the refrain at the end of Judges, &quot;In those days there
    was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes&quot; (Jud. 21:25).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Footnote on Ruth. The story is an analogy of God as go&#146;el. The narrative takes
    place during the judges era. Ruth establishes David's genealogy. In this way, Ruth
    introduces us to David (Ruth 4:18-22). It shows God's faithfulness to a woman who was not
    a Hebrew, but who migrated to Israel to become an example compassion and love. It stands
    as a bridge between the turbulent time of the judges and the Golden Age of Israel under
    the united monarchy.</li>
</ul>
<i>

<p></i>From bad to worse. 1 Samuel 4: Israel's worst defeat. Read 4:1-18. 

<ul>
  <li>Eli's sons Hophni and Phinehas are dead.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>30,000 Israeli soldiers dead</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The ark of the covenant is taken</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Jer. 7:12 says that Shiloh was invaded and the tabernacle destroyed</li>

<ul>
  <li>Eli, the judge and high priest is dead, leaving no successors</li>
</ul>

<p>What went wrong? 

<ul>
  <li>Immediate cause. The Philistine invasion. They emerged in 1190 from the northern
    coastline to invade Israel. We know much of them from Egyptian records. The &quot;Harris
    Papyrus&quot; found in Egypt, shows Phililstine battles against Ramses III. These
    invasions brought to an end Egypt's hegemony of the region. The Philistines were among the
    first to use iron (1 Sam. 13). They were enormously powerful. Israel was no match for
    their military hardware or skill.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Spiritual cause. Psalm 78:54-64. For the past 300 years, Israel had indulged in
    spiritual harlotry. Because of her unfaithfulness, God withdrew his protection from her.
    As a result, the military powers in the region had their way with Israel. The scripture
    makes it clear that the central problem was a spiritual one, not military.</li>
</ul>
<i>

<p></i>Samuel and the transition to monarchy (1&#151;8) 

<ul>
  <li>The pivotal person in God's plan is Samuel. It is through this priest/prophet/judge that
    God will change the course of Israel's history.</li>
</ul>

  <li>Israel demands a king. 8:1-9</i>. While it was God's intent to have a king (Deut. 17),
    the problem was the motivation of the Israelites: &quot;like all the nations&quot; (v. 5).
    God links the demand for a king with &quot;rejected Me for being king over them&quot; (v.
    7). Remember that Israel was to be a theocracy. That is, that the only absolute monarch
    was to be God. In this way, Israel was distinct from all of the other nations, being God's
    possession, under both his rule and his protection. The problem with Israel was that they
    were looking to a man, like Samuel, rather than to the Lord.</li>

  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>An Israelite, chosen by God. The sign of God's selection is the anointing by the
        prophet. They were to be the only legitimate king-makers. Solomon, for example, was chosen
        by Nathan the prophet over the protests of Joab, chief of the army and Abiathar the High
        Priest.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>The king is to be a servant. The king must be obedient to his master. Israel is still to
        be a theocracy. If they are obedient to Torah, God will bless them. If they are
        disobedient, they are a poor king. This is why David is called &quot;my servant
        David&quot; in Ps. 78, etc. David's desire was to do the will of God. The internal
        character and spiritual condition of the king will have a direct bearing on the plight of
        Israel. They stand as a symbol of the nation. When kings cease to be servants of the Lord,
        and rule for reasons of self-interest, they jeopardize the nation. We'll see this in the
        case of Solomon.</font></li>

        to show the unity of the nation. But it is also a wise military move: Jerusalem is a city

        Jerusalem and Washington's choice of DC.</li>

  <li>At the end of Solomon's reign, Rehoboam takes the throne. But Rehoboam does not listen
    to the protests from the elders of the northern ten tribes. They demand an end to harsh
    and abusive taxation and forced labor. The consequence of Rehoboam's failure to heed their
    warnings was the permanent division of the nation. The northern tribes select Jeroboam,
    son of Nebat as their king. The northern tribes carry the national name Israel, while the
    southern kingdom uses the tribal name Judah.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The nation is divided in three ways:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <i>
    <li>Religious division. </i>With the temple in Judah, the Levites flee to the southern
      kingdom. This leaves the north without the temple and priests. Thus, Jeroboam sets up his
      own high places for worship. This was the primary sin of the northern kingdom. It was a
      pagan fertility cult that retained some of the forms and language of the historic Hebrew
      faith. In the narrative of Kings, this cult is referred to as &quot;the sin of
      Jeroboam.&quot; The deterioration of the northern kingdom from a religious perspective
      took three turns. (i) The sin of Jeroboam, which is worshiping pagan gods in the mountains
      (1 Kings 12:26-33). This continued until king Ahab married an non-Hebrew Jezebel. She
      introduced the worship of Ba'al as the official religion of the northern kingdom. The
      religion that Joshua was to destroy now becomes the official religion of God's people (see
      1 Kings 16:30-33). (iii) King Jehu reformed Israel by ridding the nation of Ba'al worship,
      but it was an incomplete reform. He merely returned the nation to the worship of the cult
      introduced by Jeroboam (see 2 Kings 10:29-31).</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <i>
    <li>Political division.</i> There emerged two separate nations, with very little cooperation
      between them. This is of crucial importance, because of the third national division....</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <i>
    <li>Military division.</i> There was no cooperation in battle between the two kingdoms.
      Indeed, on more than one occasion, Israel and Judah formed military alliances against each
      other. The division of the nation and the unfaithfulness to God brought about the
      destruction of the northern kingdom in 722 BC under the power of the Assyrians (2 Kings
      17:1-18). Central to Assyria's method of conquest was to force colonization and
      intermarriage of the vanquished peoples. This leads to the complete destruction not only
      of a national entity, but a cultural identity. That is why we speak today of the &quot;10
      lost tribes of Israel.&quot; They literally vanish from significant history at this point.

<ul>
  <li>While the southern kingdom, Judah, was more faithful to God, she too fell to pagan
    fertility worship. But God dealt differently with Judah than with Israel. Remember that
    God had promised to David that his seed would rule over Israel forever. Because God is
    faithful to his promise, he preserved Judah even in its destruction. There were
    significant reform movements in Judah that delayed the ultimate conquest of the kingdom
    (Josiah's reform 2 Kings 22:1-13). Yet, like Israel, the unfaithfulness of Judah led to
    the conquest of the kingdom by Babylon in 586 BC. Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Jerusalem,
    looted and raised the Temple and led the royal family and others into exile in Babylon.</li>

<p>A Remnant Preserved 

<ul>
  </i>
  <li>The prophet/historians who wrote Kings and Chronicles were careful to document that the
    Davidic line remained intact even in captivity. The hope of the Davidic kingdom never died
    out. Judah was appointed to a 70 year captivity (Jer. 25:11,12; 2 Chron. 36:20,21). After
    this period, Artaxerxes, the Persian king allows Nehemiah to lead a resettlement of the
    Jerusalem. The Old Testament comes to a close ~400BC with a remnant of Judah in the land,
    and much anticipation of the revealing of the Davidic king. </li>

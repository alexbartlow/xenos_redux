      <h1>Basic Christianity </h1>
      <h5>Jim Leffel, Instructor</h5>
      <hr>
      <h3>Week Five </h3>
      <h3>What is the church? </h3>
      <p><b><i>Common misconceptions</i></b>. When you ask most people &quot;what 
        is a church?&quot; they point to a building. That's the way we think about 
        church. Sometimes the building is referred to as God's house, or even 
        a temple. The idea is that the building is somehow different. It's as 
        though God lives there. So people talk about &quot;going to church.&quot; 
        They talk differently &quot;in Church,&quot; dress differently and act 
        differently. One consequence of this is that most people think if they're 
        going to a Church, then they're Christians. &quot;Of course I'm a Christian, 
        I've been a member of St. James all of my life.&quot; </p>
      <p>Many people are actually offended by the suggestion that being a Christian 
        is other than going to church, and that being a church has nothing to 
        do with bricks and mortar. But that's what the Bible teaches.</p>
      <hr>
      <h5>New Testament meaning of &quot;ekklesia&quot; </h5>
      <p>The word for &quot;church&quot; in the New Testament is <i>ekklesia</i>. 
        This Greek word means &quot;the called out ones,&quot; or &quot;the assembly.&quot; 
        So clearly, the church has to do with the people. There are other terms 
        used for the church that also fill out the biblical view. We are called 
        &quot;the body of Christ&quot; (Eph. 1:22,23; 1 Corinthians 12:13), &quot;household 
        of God&quot; (Eph. 2:19), &quot;kingdom of God's beloved Son&quot; (Col. 
        1:13), &quot;People of God&quot; (1 Peter 2:19). Let's take a closer look 
        at the New Testament understanding of the church.</p>
      <hr>
      <h5>A new people of God </h5>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Israel and the church</u>. The descendants of Abraham, the Jews, 
          are God's chosen people. In one way, the church overlaps with Israel 
          as a new people of God (1 Peter 2:6-10). As God has been faithful to 
          his promises to Israel, so he is faithful to the church as well. A second 
          kind of overlap is that God had a strategic purpose for Israel and he 
          has one for the church too. It is in this sense that Paul referred to 
          the church as &quot;the Israel of God&quot; (Galatians 6:16). </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Yet the church is not merely a continuation of Israel. Israel is under 
        the Law of Moses (Exodus 19 ff.), while the church is free from the Law 
        (Galatians 5). God also has a distinct purpose for Israel that he does 
        not have for the church. We find that after the rapture of the church, 
        God begins to work again through Israel. So while the church and Israel 
        are related, the church is not merely a continuation of Israel. </p>
      <p>Sometimes we get the message that the church is a continuation of Israel 
        by the way church services function: priest, altar, incense, etc. But 
        the church of the New Testament didn't look anything like that.</p>
      <hr>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Fulfillment of Genesis 12:3 and Jeremiah 31</u>. Remember that 
          when God called Abraham, he told Abraham that he would bless the would 
          through him. Israel was to serve a strategic purpose in God's plan to 
          save humanity. But in Christ, this role comes to an end. It's time to 
          begin a new program, one that had been planned all along. The New Covenant 
          (Jer. 31:31-34; Ezek. 37:24-28) would be a time of blessing, when God 
          would rule forever from within. The permanent indwelling of the Holy 
          Spirit marks the beginning of the church (Acts 1:4,5; 2:14ff). Now the 
          people of God are not ethnic Jews, but anyone who has the Holy Spirit 
          indwelling them (Romans 8:9). </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <ul>
        <li><u>A radical community</u> 
          <ul>
            <li>Inclusive (Galatians 3:28). Even though the fallen humanity is 
              divided along racial, gender and economic lines, this is not so 
              for the church. What a radical message this is for its own day and 
              for ours. Obligations were placed on husbands, masters were encouraged 
              to free their slaves, and so on. </li>
            <li>Tangible love (John 17:19-26). More than anything else, New Testament 
              believers were to love one another. This is no mere sentiment either. 
              It means offering informed counsel, encouragement, exhortation, 
              practical service, etc. See 1 John 3:16-19. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <h5>A people with a mission. </h5>
      <ul>
        <li>The whole dynamic of Christian community was revolutionary. But the 
          church exists for a reason. Without clear understanding of the church's 
          role in the world, it looses its dynamism. </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <ul>
        <li><u>The Great Commission</u> (Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 5:14-20). 
          This is why there is a church. We have a charter, a mission. God has 
          called us to reach the world with the liberating message of grace in 
          Christ. That means that we need to orient our community life around 
          our mission. 
          <ul>
            <li>A place of learning (1 Peter 3:16) </li>
            <li>A place that reflects God's love (Philippians 2:1-8) </li>
            <li>A place that is culturally engaged (1 Cor. 5:9,10; 9:19-27) </li>
            <li>A place of results-oriented activism (1 Thessalonians 1:8-10; 
              Acts 1:8). </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Finding a place in God's work</u> (Ephesians 2:10; 1 Corinthians 
          12). God has a unique role for each person to play a role in God's work 
          through the church. Everyone is need. Consider the metaphor of the body: 
          1 Corinthians 12:13-27. 
          <ul>
            <li>We all have gifts given by God (1 Cor. 12:4-6). </li>
            <li>Gifts are given for the common good (v.7). You'll find your area 
              of gifting as you step out in service. </li>
            <li>All of the ministries of the church have an impact on the depth 
              and authenticity of our faith. So even if you have gifts that seem 
              far removed from evangelism, that's not really so. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <p>It has always been helpful for me to conceive of the church as a military 
        outpost. We are concerned for our safety within, but we are where we are 
        for a reason. It puts things in perspective. </p>
      <hr>
      <h3>What about the Devil? </h3>
      <hr>
      <p><i>What do you think?</i> Most people believe in God, or at least some 
        kind of infinite spiritual being. Faith in &quot;guardian angels&quot; 
        and other supernatural beings is on the rise too. Occultic activity is 
        also on the rise today. Greely's work shows that: 
      <ul>
        <li>67% have had ESP experiences </li>
        <li>42% believe that the dead can be contacted </li>
        <li>31% have had some kind of clairvoyant experience </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <p>But according to these same surveys, fewer than half believe in a literal 
        hell. Fewer still believe in a real Satan. It's okay to be spiritual, 
        but the presumption today is, &quot;if its spiritual, its got to be good.&quot; 
        This view is both recent and Western. I guess the medieval images of the 
        devil and demons are just too strange to be believed. But the Bible is 
        clear on the existence of Satan and of demons. In fact, the universe is 
        seen as a cosmic spiritual war zone between powerful spiritual armies 
        (Ephesians 2:1-3:6:10-20). As Christians, we align ourselves against a 
        real, powerful enemy. It's important that we understand Satan and what 
        he's up to. </p>
      <p>Is belief in Satan just a matter of primitive superstition? There are 
        good reasons to believe in a personal evil spiritual being. God is spirit. 
        We know that he created beings that are both physical and spiritual. Certainly, 
        he could create purely spiritual beings also. Further, we recognize that 
        people can be evil--sometimes extremely evil. So, why couldn't a spiritual 
        being also be evil? It certainly follows from the other points, upon which 
        most people agree. So it is at least reasonable to accept the Bible's 
        position on the devil. I think we don't like the idea of Satan and we've 
        had our image of him skewed by superstitious and sensational characterizations. 
        We could put it this way: Jesus certainly took Satan seriously. </p>
      <hr>
      <h5>Who is Satan? </h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Ezekiel 28. Satan is a powerful, beautiful spiritual being who became 
          corrupted through arrogant defiance of God's design for him. Since the 
          fall of Satan, he has mounted a revolution among the angels, taking 
          with him a third of them (Revelation 12:4). </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <ul>
        <li><i>What's he trying to do?</i> Convince as many persons as possible 
          that God wants to suppress our freedom to serve his interests at our 
          expense. Remember Genesis 3:4,5. That was his line to Eve, and it really 
          hasn't changed much since then. So contempt for God's rulership and 
          slander of his nature are central to Satan's schemes. </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <ul>
        <li><i>The battle lines are drawn. </i>Satan was successful in bringing 
          out rebellion with humans. God allowed Satan to tempt Adam and Eve, 
          because man needs the opportunity to choose God's way. The choice to 
          accept Satan's lie had a profound consequence: Satan was given substantial 
          authority over the world. 
          <ul>
            <li>1 John 5:19, &quot;The whole world lies in the power of the evil 
              one.&quot; Satan is also referred to as &quot;the god of this age,&quot; 
              &quot;prince of darkness,&quot; &quot;ruler of this world.&quot; 
            </li>
            <li>Note Christ's interaction with the devil in Luke 4:6. Jesus does 
              not challenge the devil's contention. </li>
            <li>Satan's hold is not absolute. God gives him a measure of freedom, 
              but he can't do what ever he wants to do. And he is neither omnipotent 
              or omniscient. </li>
            <li>Spiritual battle centers on who will rule: God or Satan. While 
              the devil has taken rule by deceit and maintains it through lies 
              and corruption, God is establishing his kingdom. The death of Christ 
              has broken Satan's hold on humanity (John 12:31; Colossians 2:15). 
              As the good news of liberation goes out through the church, captured 
              territory is taken back. </li>
            <li>We have the promise that one day, God will put an end to the destructive 
              usurpation of the evil one. But this is where the church comes in. 
              We are seeking to reclaim captured territory from Satan's clutches. 
              So we are, as Christians, in a war zone. Like it or not, we will 
              either join the resistance or capitulate to the occupation. This 
              is the same imagery Jesus used when he said, &quot;he who is not 
              for me is against me, and he who is not with me scatters&quot; (Matthew 
              12:30). </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <h5>Spiritual warfare </h5>
      <p>As combatants in spiritual warfare, it is vital that we understand our 
        enemy.</p>
      <hr>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Overt Satanic attack</u>. This is when Satan comes out from behind 
          cover and acts in obvious ways. Primarily we recognize this as demon 
          possession (Mark 5; Acts 19). This is rare, at least in the West. Though 
          it does happen. See the description in Mark 5:1-10. </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Covert Satanic attack.</u> Like a master tactician, Satan prefers 
          to work behind the scenes. We shouldn't expect him to address us with, 
          &quot;Hello, I'm the devil. I'm involved in a cosmic battle with God 
          and I consider you my territory.&quot; Mostly the devil would like to 
          distract us away from even considering the reality of spiritual warfare 
          at all. The ways he seeks to blind us from his scheme are: </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Seduction by the &quot;kosmos.&quot;</i> We read that the whole 
          world lies in the power of the evil one. The word &quot;world&quot; 
          is <i>kosmos</i> in Greek. It refers both to the physical universe and 
          to a worldly value system. The latter sense of the word is found in 
          words like &quot;cosmetics.&quot; In fact, that's a pretty good illustration 
          of what the cosmos is: Something that is made to look better than it 
          really is. Biblically, the kosmos is a counterfeit value system, taking 
          things which are a meaningful part of the life God wants for us and 
          makes them the central purpose in life. 
          <ul>
            <li>1 John 2:15-17. 
              <ul>
                <li>Lust of the flesh </li>
                <li>Lust of the eyes </li>
                <li>Boastful pride of life </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <p>So when we find that our resources and most gratifying experiences are 
        caught up in these things, we realize we've been deceived. Affluent Americans 
        are especially easy to seduce because we have so much time and opportunity 
        to indulge ourselves--with no clear moral consensus against it. </p>
      <p>Let's remember that these things are good, but not ends in themselves. 
        We can put life into perspective only when we have a clear sense of values 
        and purpose for life. Seduction takes opportunity when we are confused 
        about what's really important and what's not. We'll all struggle in these 
        areas. The question is whether we are going with the tide or against it? 
      <ul>
        <li>Are we able to do without? Do we have good habits of giving our time 
          and resources to others and to God's work? </li>
        <li>What do you think of the idea that the relative impotence of the American 
          church is tied to it's affluence? </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Temptation/Accusation</i>. This is closely related to the alluring 
          influence of the world system. We are all draw away from God's will 
          for us at times. Satan is good at exploiting our natural weaknesses--He 
          points the accusing finger: 
          <ul>
            <li>Character weaknesses. James 1:13-15. We may be prone toward bitterness 
              and judging others. Satan loves to divide churches this way. Lack 
              of control over drinking or in the sexual area can also destroy 
              a Christian walk. </li>
            <li>Natural desires. Matthew 4:2,3. Desire for a mate or for recognition 
              are common examples. Some people think that because God has not 
              delivered up a spouse, that he can't be trusted. We'll just have 
              to go out and do it our way. The need to feel significant can turn 
              into an idolatrous demand for recognition. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <p>Many Christians are crippled by moral failure. They know they've blown 
        it. Violating our conscience is a serious matter. In defeat, we can stray 
        away from God. There are a couple of things that are important to remember: 
      <ul>
        <li>2 Corinthians 7:9,10. Repentance is key. This means to &quot;change 
          our minds.&quot; </li>
        <li>Luke 4. Jesus always rebutted temptation with God's word. So should 
          we. And with accusation, we should stand our ground. Romans 8:38,39 
          teaches that nothing can separate us from God's love. Remember that 
          God will transform us &quot;through the renewing of our minds&quot; 
          (Romans 12:2). </li>
        <li>Ephesians 6:18,19. Prayer is a key. Regular prayer helps us stay alert 
          (see Luke 4:13). Also, we need to draw on the power of God in these 
          difficult areas. Will power is not really going to work. We need to 
          be transformed--which is a work of the Holy Spirit. </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Deception. </i>Our minds are a key battle ground. 2 Corinthians 
          10:3-5. Remember that Satan is a liar: Rev. 12:9; John 8:44; 2 Cor. 
          11:14. There is so much confusion and distortion of the truth. So few 
          people even know what a Christian really is. But it isn't just non Christians. 
          We need to be able to &quot;take thoughts captive to the obedience of 
          Christ.&quot; All of us can be deceived. Church history is filled with 
          examples of people getting off track doctrinally. E.g.: Counseling theory 
          is one of the problems we've seen in recent years. 
          <ul>
            <li>The solution to deception is to learn the word. That's really 
              the only objective gauge of truth we have. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

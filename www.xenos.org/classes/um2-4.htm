McCallum</a> and<a href="../personal/gary.htm?subject=evangelism%20and%20cultural%20identification"> Gary
Delashmutt</a></big></h5>

<hr>

<p><big><b>Read 1 Cor. 9:19-22</b>. The evangelistic principle here for us to imitate (see
1 Cor. 10:32-11:1) is the principle of cultural identification: Without compromising in
moral and/or doctrinal areas, we are to identify as much as possible with the
non-Christian culture we are seeking to reach. </big></p>

<p><big>&quot;though not myself...&quot; (vs 20,21) - Paul is under grace and living
within biblical moral absolutes. In the area of doctrine and morality, we are not to
compromise or else we lose what we have to offer to non- Christians. </big></p>

<p><big>&quot;to the Jew I became as a Jew . . . to those under the Law, as under the Law
. . . to those who are without law, as without law . . . to the weak I became weak . . . I
have become all things to all men&quot; - Paul meets people on their level culturally.
When with Jews, he observed their dietary restrictions (wouldn't order bacon with his
eggs). When with pagans, he went naked in the gymnasiums, quoted their authors, etc. </big></p>

<p><big><b>Why is this principle so important?</b> The language of this text makes it
clear that the observance of this principle is very important in reaching people for
Christ (&quot; . . . that I might win . . . &quot;). When we identify with our audience's
culture, more people will be reached for Christ. </big></p>

<p><big>If the gospel is really true and really universally applicable, why can't we
simply get a tract in every mailbox, a Bible in every house and say that we have
evangelized people effectively? </big></p>

<p><big>The answer to this should be obvious to all of us. People will not receive a
message which they do not perceive to be relevant to their own lives. </big></p>

<p><big>People tend to view themselves primarily in terms of their own personal
experiences and cultural heritage. Therefore, in order to be perceived as meaningful and
relevant, the gospel must be communicated in a way with which the non-Christian can
identify culturally. Non Christians can't &quot;hear&quot; the gospel effectively
otherwise because of the &quot;noise&quot; of our different culture. This is why
missiologists remind us that people like to be able to become Christians without having to
cross cultural boundaries. </big></p>

<p><big><b>Discussion Question:</b> How many of you were brought to Christ by someone with
whom you could identify personally and culturally? How big of a factor would you say this
was? </big></p>

<p><big>Along with the message of grace, this is a key evangelistic principle. In fact, it
is an expression of the message of grace. Just as we do not make people change morally
before they can come to Christ, so we don't insist that they change culturally in order to
come to Christ. Christ himself is our example for this principle. He definitely
&quot;changed cultures&quot; to reach man! Out of love, the Christian should make the
effort necessary to do just this. </big></p>

<p><big>But there is an unconscious tendency for Christians to identify Christianity with
their own personal cultural tastes and thus to drift into a cultural &quot;ghetto&quot;
that needlessly alienates non-Christians from Christ. When this is the case, Christians
often misinterpret non-Christians' distaste for their cultural tastes as &quot;hardness to
the gospel.&quot; The resultant perspective is sometimes called a &quot;fortress&quot;
mentality. </big></p>

<p><big>Christians sit safely inside the walls of their church and church culture, judging
the non-Christian world for its &quot;worldliness&quot; and hardness of heart. When this
happens, the message of the gospel becomes effectively sealed off from all but those who
happen to identify with the &quot;Christian&quot; culture. And, tragically, Christianity
is not seen as the personally and culturally relevant world-view that it is, but instead
as an irrelevant anachronism. </big></p>

<p><big>For this reason, church structures and strategies must be formulated in a way
which not only promote true spirituality, but also cultural identification with the
society to be reached. This has been a key distinctive of Xenos through the years, and
accounts for a large measure of our evangelistic success. </big></p>

<hr>

<h3><big>Discussion:</big></h3>

<p><big><b>What are some examples of the application of this principle at Xenos?</b> <br>
</big></p>

<h4><big>Central Teachings (Seeker-Sensitive Meetings)</big></h4>

<p><big>Xenos calls its large meetings (in place since 1976) <a href="../ministries/ct/ct.htm">&quot;Central Teachings&quot;</a> because we began as a
collection of home churches. The teachings we shared were centralized, unlike the rest of
our activities. </big></p>

<p><big>The purpose of the Seekers' meetings is to provide the non-Christian with a
&quot;safe place to hear a dangerous message.&quot; Every aspect of the meeting has been
designed with the unchurched seeker in mind. The atmosphere is casual and unchurchy. The
dress is also casual. The meeting is large enough for the unchurched person to feel safely
anonymous while he investigates. The musical style
and content is selected to impact the seeker rather than to promote corporate worship for
the Christian attenders. Other modern media (such as computer graphics) are used to
communicate the relevance of Christianity to modern unchurched people. </big></p>

<p><big>The teachings are filled with contemporary language and examples; theological
words are explained and we avoid &quot;Christianese.&quot; We use a contemporary version
of the Bible. Collections of money are announced with a specific disclaimer to the seeker
that he should not feel obligated to give. <br>
</big></p>

<h4><big>Parties:</big></h4>

<p><big>One of the main purposes for parties is to give non-Christian friends the
opportunity to discover that Christians in Xenos are culturally and personally relevant
people. Sometimes, the non- Christians may drink too much or become rowdy, but we feel
that parties are still an effective way of communicating the cultural &quot;common
ground&quot; that we share with non-Christians, and therefore open up additional
opportunities to discuss Christianity. <br>
</big></p>

<h4><big>Attending Bars and Non-Christian Parties: </big></h4>

<p><big>When Jesus was invited to parties held by &quot;sinners,&quot; he accepted. He
evidently did this so much that he became liable to the erroneous charge that he was a
&quot;wine-bibber and a glutton&quot; (Mt. 11:19). When he was rebuked by religious people
for this practice, he defended himself by reminding them that he &quot;did not come to
call the righteous, but sinners&quot; (Mt. 9:13). </big></p>

<p><big>Jesus loved lost people enough to identify with them culturally in this setting.
Christians have this same privilege and responsibility (although some may not have the
self-control to handle these settings). </big></p>

<h4><big>Taking in Non-Christian Movies, Books, Music, etc.:</big></h4>

<p><big>Media is a powerful expression of culture. Therefore, those who wish to reach
non-Christian people do well to understand the media of that culture. It is evident that
Paul read Greek and Roman literature because he quotes it many times in his speeches and
letters. By demonstrating an awareness of non-Christian books, movies and music, we open
doors of receptivity to the message of Christ. </big></p>

<p><big>Some object to this practice by saying that non-Christian media contains false and
immoral content. Of course, this is true. However, the Christian is equipped with the Word
of God with which to discern truth from error. If his motivation is to more effectively
reach non-Christians for Christ, he should be applauded rather than judged. </big></p>

<h3><big>Discussion:</big></h3>

<p><big>Did any of the above four factors play into your own salvation, or someone else's
that you know? If so, explain how. </big></p>

<p><big>Some Christians can communicate a very clear, crisp explanation of the gospel
message, but are really lacking in the cultural identification department. Other
Christians can relate beautifully with the culture, but often find themselves tongue-tied,
shy, or they let golden opportunities float by to explain Christ to the non-Christian.
Some Christians are pretty good at both or neither of these elements. Which of these most
characterizes you these days? </big></p>

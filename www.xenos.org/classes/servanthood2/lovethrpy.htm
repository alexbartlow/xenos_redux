      <h3><b><font face="Arial"> Introduction</font></b> <em>(Based upon the <a href="../../ministries/counseling/luvthpy.htm">Love 
        Therapy</a> essay by Dennis McCallum.)</em></h3>
      <h4>The system of personality evaluation and counseling known as <em>Love 
        Therapy</em> owes its definition to Dr. Ralph Ankenman.</h4>
      <h4>We are going to take a closer look at the Biblical model. In particular, 
        stage 4 (action).</h4>
      <h4>The biblical basis for Love Therapy</h4>
      <blockquote> 
        <h4> The biblical principle that the key to solving most emotional problems 
          is the development of "victorious love output." See John&nbsp;13:17 
          for one biblical statement of this principle. (This is not just for 
          the person who is struggling emotionally. It forms the crux of the lifestyle 
          toward which all Christians should be striving.)</h4>
        <h4>Remember that the context speaks of two "things" we should know and 
          do&#151;Jesus' love for us and us loving others in the same way. Connect 
          this to last week's Biblical Model.</h4>
        <h4>This position is in accord with many other authors, including Larry 
          Crabb. However, Love Therapy goes further practical application of this 
          insight. </h4>
        <blockquote> 
          <h4>Love therapy actually attempts to define the main aspects of biblical 
            love and associated problem areas.</h4>
          <h4>After carefully defining love, love therapy uses the definition 
            as a yardstick by which to measure or identify various deficiencies 
            in a person's relational life. This in turn provides positive corrective 
            direction for the person, in the power of the Spirit.</h4>
        </blockquote>
        <h4>The key to success in one's emotional life</h4>
        <blockquote> 
          <h4>In love therapy, the key to success in one's emotional life is giving 
            victorious mature love <i>output</i>, rather than getting love <i>input</i>. 
            No matter how those around us behave, we are always able to employ 
            biblical principles of love, and in non-clinical cases, this will 
            eventually result in emotional health. </h4>
          <h4>This is the antithesis of not only the victim mentality that pervades 
            our culture today, it's also the way we all tend to view our life 
            and problems. &#150; &quot;I did what I did BECAUSE of how they treated 
            me&quot; &#150; implying therefore it wasn't wrong; I couldn't help 
            myself.</h4>
          <h4>Therefore, love therapy sees the client's problems as a result of, 
            or caused by their OWN failure to <i>victoriously</i> deal with others 
            in all situations (compare with Freud and Rogers). Stated positively, 
            we are called to respond in a loving manner in all relationships and 
            situations, regardless of the provocation. What a great vision for 
            growth!! Our sanctification is not dependent on how others treat me. 
            It is only dependent on me appropriating the power of God to love 
            others in the situation. Naturally, we are not advocating a perfectionism, 
            but rather a gradual progression of significant sanctification through 
            the transformation of OUR character.</h4>
        </blockquote>

      <h4>Goal for this evening</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>First, we'll define ideal biblical love. We are not interested in 
            learning a deluded humanistic view of love. We can be confident that 
            God is going to get us there i.e. gradual change (Stage 5 of the Biblical 
            Model).</h4>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Next, we will study various common love deficiencies in relationships. 
            Our goal is to learn a vocabulary of common love deficiencies.</h4>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Finally, we will examine some typical strategies for victorious 
            love development for various types of people. (Continuums)</h4>

      </font></b>
<h4>Biblical/Christian Love defined: A commitment to give of one's self 
        in every area for the good of another. </h4>
      <h4>Put differently, "mature love" in love therapy includes four aspects. 
        These aspects can be conceived as parts of the whole as the following 
        diagram shows.</h4>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="CENTER"><img src="graphics/biblove.gif" width=281 height=141></p>
      </blockquote>
      <h4><b>The Sacrificial Aspect</b></h4>
      <blockquote><font face="Arial"><b> </b></font> 
        <h4>Definition: commitment to give of one's self for the good of another</h4>
        <h4>The <i>sacrificial</i> aspect of love is based on passages such as 
          John&nbsp;3:16 and Mark&nbsp;10:45. See also John&nbsp;15:13,34&#151;where 
          Jesus tells us that love lays down its life for its friends, and then 
          calls on us to love one another the way he has loved us.</h4>
        <h4>Key Elements to Sacrificial Love</h4>
        <blockquote> 
          <h4><i>Sacrificial love involves initiative.</i> This love does not 
            require that the other person request help. After all, "no one seeks 
            for God," "but while we were still powerless, Christ died for the 
            ungodly." (Romans&nbsp;5:6) </h4>
          <blockquote> 
            <h4>Put differently in 1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:19, "We love because he 
              first loved us." This means that the idea of positive servitude 
              is an active, rather than a passive concept. The lover is not <i>responding</i> 
              to love demands; he/she is <i>seeking</i> ways to serve and meet 
              needs. </h4>
            <h4>It also means that biblical lovers won't complain that, "no one 
              has called me on the phone," or that, "It's always me who has to 
              do the asking," etc. To the Christ-like lover, initiative is always 
              viewed as an opportunity, not as a burden. The creativity and work 
              needed to come up with new ways to initiate love giving are part 
              of the sacrifice of love.</h4>

            when he allowed himself to be crucified while innocent. He did not

              than self-sacrifice (e.g., business dealings, crime and punishment, 
              and a just war). Most of these relationships are not love relationships,

          <h4>Likewise, different people can be treated differently even though 
            their actions are identical. When practicing discipline in love, our 
            focus is toward the future (seeking redemptive change), whereas the 
            focus of justice is on the past (matching the punishment to the crime).</h4>
          <h4>Discipline in love is never the product of an angry loss of self-control. 
            Discipline is a carefully measured response to observed behavior or 
            attitudes. Anger may be incorporated into a disciplinary discussion 
            for the sake of emphasis. However, such anger would be an "anger without 
            sin" (Ephesians&nbsp;4:26) because it is not a selfish reaction to 
            the violation of one's personal rights. Like Jesus, who demonstrated 
            anger when cleansing the temple, we may realize that some people will

      <p>The Emotional Aspect of Love</p>
      </font></b>
      <blockquote><font face="Arial"><b> </b></font>
        <p>Definition: meeting legitimate emotional needs when possible and appropriate</p>
        <p>The emotional needs of other people are important as well as their
          practical needs (thus the phrase "in every area.") Therefore, if we
          serve others in a cold and unfeeling way, we are loving sub-biblically.
          There is abundant biblical support for this aspect of biblical love.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Jesus felt compassion for the sheep of Israel who had no shepherd
            (Matt.&nbsp;9:36), and wept over Jerusalem's unrepentance (Luke 19:41)
            and at Lazarus' tomb (Jn.&nbsp;11:35), Paul expresses emotional encouragement,
            disclosure, empathy and compassion in his letters. </p>
          <p>Scripture calls on all Christians to be "kind and tender-hearted" (Eph.&nbsp;4:29),
            to "show affection to one another in brotherly love" (Rom.&nbsp;12:10),
            and to "greet one another with a holy kiss (Rom.&nbsp;16:16).</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>On the one hand, biblical love does not insist that we constantly <i>feel</i> strong
          sensations of affection, sorrow, or ecstasy for another. Rather, it
          calls us to <i>express </i>these emotions based on the truth. Therefore,
          emotional expression can and should go beyond the immediate feeling
          of the one expressing it. </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The larger context of the relationship may dictate that I express
            affection and care, even when I do not feel spontaneously compelled
            to do so. Such expression would not be manipulation because what
            I express is actually true, and because I am expressing it in order
            to give, not to take. In fact, expressing nurturing emotion often
            more truly reflects the truth about a relationship than would a lack
            of such expression. (Communicating appreciation for your friend's
            involvement in your life, love for them, etc.) </p>
          <p>In theory, as we learn to express emotions, the present experience
            of those feelings becomes more frequent and enjoyable. As in other
            areas of life, Christians can find their feelings coming into line
            with what they know to be true. </p>
          <p>For this reason, we might find it appropriate to take loved ones
            to task for their lack of emotional expression, but only if such
            confrontation is for their own good. Anyone who cannot express caring
            emotion has a problem that will inhibit close relationships. Therefore,
            we may be moved by the principle of discipline in love to approach
            others with their need to change lest their own relationships (perhaps
            including the ones with us) suffer. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>On the other hand, those who are already strongly emotional may need
          to consider <i>how</i> they express emotions as well. </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Negative emotional expressions should be controlled. If we feel
            justified in "venting" our feelings, even though they are not edifying
            or even destructive to others, we are practicing a selfish form of
            love alien to the Bible (see Galatians 5:20, Proverbs 17:14) Limit
            it to mature people and articulate I am just venting and I need God's
            perspective. <font size=2>The beginning of strife is like letting
            out water, So abandon the quarrel before it breaks out.</font>). </p>
          <p>Expressing positive emotions, but also demanding the desired response
            is closer to manipulation than sacrificial love. Likewise, if we
            demand that others express certain emotions in certain ways (e.g.
            demanding others appreciate us) we violate the concept of sacrificial
            love mentioned above. These are love demands, which are antithetical
            to the notion of self-giving.</p>

      <p>The Tribal Love Sphere</p>
      </font></b>
      <blockquote><font face="Arial"><b> </b></font>
        <p>Definition: Tribalistic people are comfortable with only a small circle
          of relationships. Those outside their own families and/or very close
          friends are usually limited to a superficial level involving business
          or diplomacy.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The term "tribalistic" comes from oral cultures where members of
            other tribes are often viewed as sub-human. Tribes commonly use the
            same word for both the name of their tribe and for "human being." </p>
          <p>Tribalists have little interest in relating to members of other "tribes" on
            a personal level. People outside the tribe are treated virtually
            like symbols rather than actual people. Their needs are something
            less than real because they don't affect the tribe. Meanwhile, relationships
            within the tribe are expected to completely meet all relational needs.
            Such expectations are really love demands, and other family members
            feel burdened and suffocated because they can never fulfill such
            demands.</p>
          <p>Such people usually selfishly cling to old relationships because
            they find the process of building new relationships burdensome or
            even frightening. Some people form relatively few relationships and
            remain in those relationships as long as possible, even if they are
            destructive. In extreme (though not unusual) cases, some people's
            circle of relationships is no larger than the nuclear family.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Features of tribalism</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Narrowness in relational life is often connected to a general narrowness
            or rigidity in most areas of life. Tribalism in non-relational areas
            of life is called &quot;functional tribalism.&quot; The functionally
            tribalistic person derives a sense of security from "sameness." Although
            the status quo may not be particularly satisfying, it is better than
            changing to something new. </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Therefore, tribalistic people tend to live with a great deal of
              routine in their lives. The same schedule every week and every
              day will tend to be comforting to the tribalistic person, while
              not knowing what is going to happen next causes anxiety. The diffuse
              person would feel trapped by the same routine that makes tribal
              people feel secure. </p>
            <p>The tribalist's insistence on a strict routine may interfere with
              the need to adapt to new conditions at work or elsewhere. In extreme
              cases, the tribalist may eventually lose the ability to function
              in any but one way. (Movie &#150; Pleasantville)</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Control is a key word for understanding the tribalistic love sphere.
            The tribal person is very controlling in order to keep their world
            intact. Various phobic complexes can result from the inability of
            the tribalist to control some aspects of the environment. Anxiety
            can come to play an increasing role as the tribalist worries that
            he/she may lose control of the situation or of the future.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>For functionally tribal people, messiness is very disturbing,
              while a diffuse person often has no problem with messiness. This
              characteristic rigidity may extend into all areas of life, reflecting
              a desire for structure and predictability. </p>
            <p>This desire for predictability may lead to a form of relating
              based on controlling loved ones. The tribal person may interpret
              another's submission to their control as love. Yet, as the love
              feelings resulting from control of, let's say, the other's schedule
              wears off, the tribal lover feels the need to exert further control
              in other areas just to keep up the same feelings. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Ironically, tribalists often end up with quite alienated relationships
            even within their own tribe.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>In marriage, this desire for control may also result in a variety
              of sexual dysfunctions. These could range from the need to have
              sex in only one way, to complete frigidity or impotence when the
              person feels unable to enter into an intimate, yet uncontrollable
              situation requiring improvisation and vulnerability.</p>
            <p>Those within the tribe may end up jumping through incredible hoops
              to avoid punishment. Family members who realize that they are expected
              to meet all of the needs of the tribalist often feel repelled. </p>
            <p>The ingrown environment breeds relational ill health, infighting,
              and simmering resentments. Hysterical episodes sometimes afflict
              extreme tribalists who feel they are losing control.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>When tribalistic people need to form new relationships (perhaps
            because one's tribe is gone), this often results in depression or
            other emotional problems.</p>
          <p>Tribal people tend to perceive love as "permanent love values"</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"Permanent love values" refer to the sense of security and relaxation
              that some people feel when sitting around their parent's or their
              own house in a familiar chair, with family members around them,
              etc. Tribalistic people associate "permanent love values&quot; with
              love.</p>

          <p>Impact on Spiritual Development: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Tribalistic Christians often have difficulty getting incorporated

              their gifts in ministry, and accepting change in the church.</p>

        <p>Definition: Diffuse people tend to be fragmented relationally, investing
          in many people at once, but few or none deeply. </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The diffuse person is the opposite of the tribalistic. Diffuse people
            demonstrate a tendency to become quickly involved in a new relationship,
            and to immediately feel "close." However, they typically fail to
            invest sufficiently in the relationship&#151;especially after the
            initial enthusiasm wears off. Relationships tend to become &quot;boring.&quot; As
            relational problems arise, the diffuse person often finds it easier
            to form a relationship with someone else than to resolve problems
            in existing relationships. The result is usually a series of superficial
            relationships. </p>
          <p>In extreme cases, diffuse people may never actually form any relationships
            at all. They may simply meet people and interact on a sub-relational

        <p>Features of diffuseness</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Just as the tribalistic individual desires structure and control
            in life, the diffuse person desires stimulation and freedom. Lack
            of stimulation leads to boredom, restlessness and often resentment
            toward loved ones. Diffuse people may find stimulation in either
            the functional area (video games or job changes) or in the relational
            area (moving from one romance to another). Apart from sanctification,
            this tendency tends to develop assorted emotional disorders as time
            goes on. </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Typical types of disorders are drug addiction, alcoholism, obesity,
              and inability to succeed at a job, finish school or complete other
              complex tasks. This is because the failure to build deep relationships
              results in a sense of boredom, emptiness or void that demands solution.
              The diffuse person typically reacts to such feelings by seeking
              greater stimulation. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>In marriage, a diffuse person may refuse to invest in a relationship
            now considered &quot;old hat.&quot; Diffuse spouses may struggle
            with constant feelings of dissatisfaction in the marital sexual relationship
            because it isn't as stimulating as other immoral relationships, or
            even as the married relationship was at the beginning. Their spouses
            often complain that they are never home.</p>
          <blockquote>

              intense romantic attraction, high-risk sports, drug intoxication,
              public acclaim, etc. Diffuse people tend to falsely equate present
              love feelings with actually being loved. Anything else in their

      </font></b>
      <blockquote><font face="Arial"><b> </b></font>
        <p>Love Therapy does not seek to eliminate tribalistic or diffuse tendencies.
          Rather, it seeks to achieve a relative <i>balance</i> between them.
          A mature biblical lover should be able to build and enjoy a tribal
          framework, while also possessing both the ability and the desire to
          establish new relationships and care for those outside the tribe. </p>
        <p>The scriptural mandate for such a balance is clear. </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Jesus critiques extreme tribalists in Matthew&nbsp;5:46, where he
            rejects the idea of "loving only them that love you." </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Likewise, the Pharisees' attempt to evade responsibility to love
              outsiders was rebuked by the example of the Good Samaritan (Luke&nbsp;10:25-37).
              Jesus was constantly challenging his disciples' (tribalistic) prejudice
              against non-Jewish people.</p>
            <p>All of the passages that call for outreach to the lost (cf. Matthew
              28:19) are also, by implication, against excessive tribalism.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Paul's call for deep love relationships, such as a marriage envisioned
            in Ephesians&nbsp;5:25-29, are antithetical to a diffuse lifestyle.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The principle of "remaining in that condition in which you were
              called," (1 Corinthians&nbsp;7:20) is also antithetical to excessive
              diffuseness.</p>
            <p>The author of Hebrews calls for both "love of the brethren" and "love
              of strangers" (hospitality) in Hebrews&nbsp;13:1,2. Paul calls
              for the same balance in Colossians&nbsp;3:12-16; 4:5,6.</p>

      <p>The Work Substitute </p>
      </font></b>
      <blockquote><font face="Arial"><b> </b></font>
        <p>"Work substitute" describes a love deficiency in the area of emotional
          giving. The work substitute replaces emotional giving with accomplishment.
          This syndrome is commonly found in men in western culture, although
          a very small number of women also manifest the syndrome.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>It is not that the work-substitutes don't feel emotion or can't
            express it. They can usually feel and express anger, enthusiasm about
            a sporting event or getting a promotion, etc. The main problem is
            with expressing affection, encouragement, etc. He is guilty of substituting
            the enjoyment of goal attainment at work or home for the fulfillment
            of deep love relationships. Likewise, he replaces expressions of
            love with &quot;doing things&quot; for others. Overt emotional statements
            and actions seem mushy, ridiculous, and unnecessary to the work substitute.</p>
          <p>The work substitute commonly cannot understand what others want
            from him in the area of emotion. He is aware that his wife and others
            complain that he is unloving, but finds this confusing. He points
            out that he brings home the pay check, that he bought his wife a
            new car, and that he spends time with the family, unlike a lot of
            husbands who run around all the time.</p>
          <p>When seeking an emotional component in relationships, the work substitute
            often replaces positive nurturing emotional expressions with negative
            emotional relating (EXAMPLES: "pigtail pulling" by pinching wife
            or poking fun at his child; sarcasm).</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It is imperative that the work substitute learn how to express sincere
          and positive emotion to his loved ones, and that his pigtail pulling
          be curtailed substantially.</p>
        <p>Spiritual Impact:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Discipleship will suffer because you need to become close with another
            person. We have to be open about our lives and probe into the lives
            of others. May be more oriented toward the legalistic model. Tend
            to not be in touch with emotions other than anger.</p>

      <p>The Work-For-Love</p>
      </font></b>
      <blockquote><font face="Arial"><b> </b></font>
        <p>The work for love is deficient in the disciplining aspect of love.
          Instead of disciplining the loved one, work-for-loves will perform
          loving service and/or sacrifice to &quot;remedy&quot; the problem or
          keep things running smoothly. </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The work-for-love defect is a deficiency that nearly always afflicts
            women. She is by definition tribalistic, and usually kind, emotional,
            and sacrificial. Their selfless giving is motivated by heartfelt
            affection and duty, but there is a catch.</p>
          <p>The work-for-love eventually begins to feel resentment about the
            fact that her family doesn't appreciate her enough. As these feelings
            of resentment arise, the work-for-love reacts by working harder than
            ever. Hence, the term work-for-love. She actually works and serves
            those in her family, not in an authentically sacrificial way, but
            in order to buy love from them.</p>
          <p>Because she is actually bribing her family to love her, she finds
            it impossible to appropriately discipline. She is vulnerable to manipulation
            by others at the same time that she is guilty of manipulating them
            through "guilt trips," martyr complex, etc. This failure to discipline
            ironically leads her tribe to take her for granted.</p>
          <p>Later in life, when the children leave home, the work-for-love reaches
            a serious crisis in her life. Her husband (who she has not disciplined),
            who is often a work substitute, cannot meet her emotional needs,
            and she has failed to build other deep relationships outside of the
            family. She usually has not built skills and interests in the functional
            area either, other than cooking, sewing etc. for the kids. As a result,
            she may become increasingly depressed, neurotic and extravagant in
            her efforts to attract attention from her uncaring family.</p>
          <p>Work-for-love Christians, with their zeal for service and encouragement,
            can be a great resource to the Body of Christ. But they often run
            into trouble with discipleship when loving confrontation is necessary.</p>
          <p>This love defect appears to be diminishing today. Postmodernism,
            feminism and the media have worked hard to reject the ethic of the
            serving spouse and mother.</p>
          <p>Spiritual Impact:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Discipleship is difficult because of the unwillingness to discipline.

      <p>The Infantile</p>

      <blockquote><font face="Arial"><b> </b></font>
        <p>The infantile is usually deficient in both the sacrificial and forgiving
          aspects of biblical love. Infantiles are more focused on what they
          want/how others are affecting them rather than on how they are affecting
          others.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>This term is used in Love Therapy to refer to a stage of emotional
            development typical of children. Children feel deeply for others
            existentially, but there is also a very strong self-centeredness
            in their feeling. They tend to take their parents' efforts and sacrifices
            in raising them for granted. They can't understand why they shouldn't
            be able to gratify all of their desires immediately. If they meet
            with limitations or frustrations, they may cry or throw a temper-tantrum.
            Children will sometimes be very giving, but they also expect to receive,
            and feel that they are being treated unfairly when they don't receive
            what they think they should. When children quarrel with one another,
            they cannot understand the perspective of the other child, and continue
            to feel that their own view is correct and that they have the right
            to use force if necessary to get their way. Unfortunately (and increasingly
            in western culture), many of these features are also found in adults. </p>
          <p>Those who are close to infantiles complain that they are never satisfied.
            They have difficulty appreciating the extent of the sacrifice others
            make on their behalf. </p>
          <p>They may exhibit explosive tantrums, or withdrawal tactics similar
            to the child who be to confront.</p>
          <p>The most devastating deficiency of the infantile is lack of forgiveness.
            The infantile will usually feel that to simply overlook a wrong done
            by another, or to forget it permanently is a betrayal of justice.
            Conversely, they are often shocked when people don't easily forgive
            their sins!</p>
          <p>On the positive side, sanctified infantile people are often enjoyable
            to be around for a variety of reasons. They are often more emotionally
            expressive than others. </p>
          <p>It would be a mistake to think that the infantile love defect is
            any worse than the work-for-love or work-substitute love defect. </p>
          <p>Spiritual Impact:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Discipleship is typically conditional (feel disrespected, so they

        <p>The following pairs of terms describe important complementary components

            moved to tears relatively easily, or having little or no problem "sweet
            talking" others. The one who feels uncomfortable with emotional expressions
            of affection is demonstrating relatively less emotional orientation,
            while the one who has his/her feelings hurt easily is demonstrating
            more. </p>
          <blockquote>

              from any personality type. However, people at the emotional end

          <p>"Functional" refers to one who tends to approach life from a thinking

            He feels like it is a waste of time to sit and talk about feelings,

            <p>GOAL: Discover and cultivate the freedom to think objectively,
              rationally and act regardless of feelings. Appreciate the stability
              and objectivity of those who are more functionally inclined.</p>
            <p>Practical Steps</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Persuade of the scriptural relationship between FACTS, FAITH &amp; FEELINGS.
                The following passages are helpful here: Joshua 3:13-16; 2 Cor.
                5:7; John 13:17; James 1:22-25; 1 John 3:18-20. Emphasize that
                spiritual growth requires choosing to do what is true, no matter
                how strongly to the contrary we may feel. It also requires thinking
                rationally and objectively about relationships, and to judge
                feelings in the light of truth.</li>
              <li>Remind him of how he has experienced both the negatives of
                acting on his feelings, and the positives of acting on the truth
                in spite of his feelings.</li>
              <li>Help him build more of the above positive experiences in their
                his with God. For example, urge him to come to home group even
                though he feels bad, pick him up&#151;then later when he feels
                better, point out why.</li>
              <li>Challenge him to review the last several months and recount
                what scary steps God has called on him to take. What was his
                response? What was the result?</li>
            </ul>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Functional </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>GOAL: Believe that emotional relating is God-given and important,
              and develop the ability to relate this way on a consistent basis.
              Appreciate the sensitivity and warmth of those who are more emotionally
              inclined. </p>
            <p>Practical steps:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Persuade of the scriptural importance of emotional love giving
                (see above passages). Help him recall how such expressions have
                been meaningful and helpful to him. Tie this area into ministry
                effectiveness; (Gal. 5:22-23; 1 Thess. 2:7-8; 2 Tim. 2:24) you
                can't go around this to leadership, etc.</li>
              <li>Suggest that low-grade depression and consequent poor functioning
                are often because of insufficient emotional intimacy in key relationships.
                Help him experience this correlation positively, and then point
                it out.</li>
              <li>Stress acting on feelings of warmth and affection when they
                occur. But also stress that choosing to express such sentiments
                is valid and important (and not "faky") even when not felt, and
                emphasize that this becomes easier and more enjoyable with practice.</li>
              <li>Functioners need to be called on to discuss feelings and emotional
                factors in relationships, including those areas that they don't
                understand. Structure time for personal relating; take advantage
                of his functional strength here! Spell out how to talk with his
                spouse about this area of their relationship. Consider the following
                questions:</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
              <p>How have you been feeling this week?</p>
              <p>How have I made you feel this week?</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>GOAL: Identify and substantially overcome compulsive and controlling
              behaviors. Appreciate the value of and enjoy the fruit of spontaneity.</p>
            <p>Practical Steps</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Persuade from scripture that rigidity and controlling are rooted
                in anxiety, and therefore sinful because they are rooted unbelief
                in God's sovereign goodness and unloving. Consider the following
                passages: Matthew 6:25-34; Phil.&nbsp;4:6,7; Lk.&nbsp;10:38-42.
                Refute excuses like "I wouldn't want to become irresponsible" with
                statements like "That will never be your problem!"</li>
              <li>Point out that this tendency, unless actively attacked through
                sanctification, results in ever-worsening phobias, depression,
                and alienation. When we give into fear, its power over us grows
                (BOA CONSTRICTOR). Are there people in his life who illustrate
                this&#151;especially people whose rigidity adversely affected
                him?</li>
              <li>Urge him to take doable steps of faith to lean against his
                fears and relate to God and others in new/spontaneous ways. EXAMPLES:
                leaving the dishes after a meal in order to converse with your
                guests; giving bookkeeping responsibility to spouse; engaging
                a new person at home group or work; giving money, including spontaneous
                giving; trying a new ministry area). When possible, be with him
                at first as he does this to provide some security, reward it
                with love, and rejoice with him afterward as he enjoys the righteous
                exhilaration and increased confidence.</li>
              <li>Call on him to learn how to enjoy spontaneity from the diffuse.
                Agree to spend time with a healthy diffuse person, allowing them
                to set the &quot;agenda&quot; without critique.</li>

            <p>Practical steps</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Persuade from scripture that self-discipline and endurance
                are important virtues. Consider these passages: Prov.&nbsp;13:4;
                20:4; 26:14-16; 1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;9:24-27; Rom.&nbsp;5:3-5; Heb.&nbsp;12:1-11.
                If he aspires to ministry effectiveness and leadership, point
                out that he cannot get around this issue.</li>
              <li>Challenge him to reflect on what his avoidance of these virtues
                has cost him in his life (relationships; jobs; finances; etc.).
                Acceptance of the necessity of routine is a key step in healing
                the relational and functional problems in his life.</li>
              <li>Do some of his most distasteful routine with him&#151;and then
                reward it afterward with some fun diffuse activity. For example,
                study silently next to him for 1-2 hours, then go have a beer. </li>
              <li>Help him set up a realistic routine and structure in school,
                work, family, fellowship, ministry, etc. Secure permission to
                ask about how he is doing with his structure&#151;and then ask
                him periodically.</li>
              <li>Add structure gradually so as not to overwhelm. When he fails,
                encourage him not to throw it overboard, but see the big picture,
                progress made, etc.</li>

        <p>DESCRIPTION</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Empathetic" refers to the ability to understand and even enter
            into others' perspective, situation and feelings. This is a feature
            of the emotional aspect of love. Work-for-loves are normally empathetic;
            infantiles are selectively empathetic.</p>
          <p>"Confrontive" refers to the ability to evaluate others' attitudes
            and actions in light of the truth, and to correct them for their
            good. This is a feature of the disciplining aspect of love. Most
            infantiles can confront&#151;though often without self-control and
            for the wrong reasons. Work-for-loves are highly aversive to avoid
            confrontation. Work-substitutes tend to confront more readily about
            functional issues than about relational issues.</p>

              <li>Persuade of the scriptural importance of discipline truth-speaking
                as a part of love. Consider Eph.&nbsp;4:15,25 as well as the
                above passages on the disciplining aspect of love.</li>
              <li>Help him to see how failure to do this has hurt his loved ones.
                Persuade him that his so-called sensitivity is in many cases
                a selfish act of self-preservation at the expense of his loved
                ones. Most empathizers tend to deny, minimize, or rationalize
                the other person's wrong behavior so they will not have to confront
                them. Instead, they need to let truth&#151;not personal comfort&#151;dictate
                how they will handle these uncomfortable situations. </li>
              <li>Cut off chronic complaints when he is unwilling to confront.
                Never confront for him!</li>
              <li>Focus on a concrete issue in a close relationship. Help him
                plan carefully how to bring up the issue, pray with them beforehand,
                etc. Remind him that success is the willingness to do the right
                thing for his loved one, regardless of how he/she responds initially.
                Be there afterward to talk over how it went. Praise him, especially
                if he stood his ground and did not compromise his principles.
                Point out how much better he feels after taking this step of
                faith.</li>

              <li>Until more mature, urge him to delay most confrontations until
                he has cooled off, prayed, sought advice, etc. Many times, he
                will realize that what is needed is forbearance rather than confrontation.</li>

                plan for restoration whenever possible.</li>

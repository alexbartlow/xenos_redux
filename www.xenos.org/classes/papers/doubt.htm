<h1>Historical Evidence for <br>
  the Resurrection of Christ:</h1>
<h5>by Christopher Louis Lang</h5>
<hr>
<p>3-7-93 </p>
<h3>The Evidence: A Brief Survey</h3>
<h5>Approaching the Bible</h5>
<p>In order to examine the evidence for the resurrection we must place ourselves 
  in the historical situation. The events surrounding the life and death of Christ 
  didn't occur at a place where we can gain no knowledge of them. Rather, they 
  occurred in history, on earth, and were recorded by men who witnessed the events. 
</p>
<p>When we approach an ancient document such as the Bible or another ancient document 
  such as Tacitus' History of Rome (115 A.D.) we must come to the text with an 
  understanding attitude. This does not mean that we assume the text to be 100 
  per cent true. But we need to be able to ask the right questions. In the first 
  century much less writing took place than does in our time. Many were illiterate, 
  few could read, much less write, and paper or parchment (leather) to write on 
  was expensive. The incentive to fabricate was not as it is today. In other words,<i> 
  The National Enquirer</i>, could never have been published at this time. A high 
  regard was given to writing and the luxury to create fictional material was 
  virtually non-existent, for instance there was no such thing as a novel or a 
  newspaper, although there were artistic writings such as poetry. The Bible however, 
  is a much different kind of literature. It was not written as a poem or story, 
  although it also contains poetry. It was for the most part written as history 
  and is intended to communicate truth throughout.</p>
<p>The gospel of Luke begins: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile an account of the things accomplished 
    among us, just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants 
    of the word [Paul, Peter, etc] have handed them down to us, it seemed fitting 
    for me as well, having investigated everything carefully from the beginning, 
    to write it out for you in consecutive order, most excellent Theophilus; so 
    that you might know the exact truth about the things you have been taught. 
    (Lk 1:1-4) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luke was not an apostle, he was however the companion of Paul and probably 
  dictated some of his letters. Luke tells us that he is writing in consecutive 
  order because the other gospels, Matthew, Mark and John, are written more by 
  topic than chronologically.</p>
<p>How do we know anything historically? There is no &quot;scientific&quot; proof 
  that Lincoln was the president. We cannot recreate him in a laboratory or bring 
  him back to life. We cannot reproduce the experiment. We cannot calculate an 
  equation that tells us that he was. But we can assert with a high degree of 
  probability that Lincoln was indeed our president and was assassinated in 1865. 
  We do this by appealing to historical evidence. Many people saw Lincoln. We 
  have some of his writings and even his picture, not to mention his likeness 
  on our pennies. But none of this &quot;proves&quot;, in a scientific sense, 
  that Lincoln ever lived or was the president. </p>
<p>The kind of evidence used in historical research is the same kind as that used 
  in a court of law. In a courtroom case certain kinds of evidences are appealed 
  to in order to determine what exactly happened, eyewitnesses are questioned, 
  motives are examined, and physical evidence is scrutinized such as fingerprints 
  or journal writings. </p>
<p>It is the same kind of evidence that we appeal to in order to establish Christ's 
  life, death, and resurrection. Granted, the evidence is not as great as that 
  for Lincoln, nor as recent. But it is better evidence than we have that Plato 
  ever lived, or Homer, or many historical figures that we take for granted.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Historical Evidence Outside of the Bible</h3>
<p>Often people are uncertain about the existence of Christ, but few scholars 
  would disagree that a man named Jesus lived roughly between 2 BC and about 33 
  AD. History documents that this man was not a myth but a real person and the 
  historical evidence for this is excellent. For instance, the Roman historian 
  Tacitus, writing in about 115 A.D., records the events surrounding Emperor Nero 
  in July of A.D. 64. After the fire that destroyed much of Rome, Nero was blamed 
  for being responsible:</p>
<p>Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted 
  the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called 
  Christians by the populace. Christus [Christ], from whom the name had its origin, 
  suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one 
  of our procurators, Pontius Pilate, and a most mischievous superstition [Christ's 
  resurrection] thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judea, 
  the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and 
  shameful from every part of the world find their center and become popular. 
  (Bettenson, p. 2)</p>
<p>In about 112 A.D. the Roman governor of what is now northern Turkey wrote to 
  Emperor Trajan regarding the Christians in his district:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;I was never present at any trial of Christians; therefore I do not 
    know what are the customary penalties or investigations, and what limits are 
    observed. . . whether those who recant should be pardoned. . . whether the 
    name itself, even if innocent of crime, should be punished, or only the crimes 
    attaching to that name. . . . Meanwhile, this is the course that I have adopted 
    in the case of those brought before me as Christians. I ask them if they are 
    Christians. If they admit it I repeat the question a second and a third time, 
    threatening capital punishment; if they persist I sentence them to death. 
    For I do not doubt that, whatever kind of crime it may be to which they have 
    confessed, their pertinacity and inflexible obstinacy should certainly be 
    punished. . . the very fact of my dealing with the question led to a wider 
    spread of the charge, and a great variety of cases were brought before me. 
    An anonymous pamphlet was issued, containing many names. All who denied that 
    they were or had been Christians I considered should be discharged, because 
    they called upon the gods at my dictation and did reverence. . .and especially 
    because they cursed Christ, a thing which it is said, genuine Christians cannot 
    be induced to do.&quot; (Bettenson, p. 3)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These passages indicate that Christianity was wide spread in the Roman empire 
  within 80 years of Christ's death. Again, these are eyewitness accounts, not 
  historians looking back years later.</p>
<p>The popular historian Will Durant, himself not a Christian, wrote concerning 
  Christ's historical validity, &quot;The denial of that existence seems never 
  to have occurred even to the bitterest gentile or Jewish opponents of nascent 
  Christianity&quot; (Durant, <i>The Story of Civilization</i>, vol. 3, p. 555). 
  And again, &quot;That a few simple men should in one generation have invented 
  so powerful and appealing a personality, so lofty an ethic and so inspiring 
  a vision of human brotherhood, would be a miracle far more incredible than any 
  recorded in the Gospels&quot; (<i>Ibid</i>., p. 557). </p>
<p>It is a substantial thing that an historian who spends his life considering 
  historical facts should affirm the reality of Christ's existence as well as 
  the rapid growth of the early movement.</p>
<p>The Jewish historian Josephus,writing for the Roman government in the 70's 
  A.D. records some incidental things regarding Christ and the church. He confirms 
  that John the Baptist died at the hand of Herod (this same incident is recorded 
  in the gospels) as well as the death of, &quot;The brother of Jesus, who was 
  called Christ, whose name was James. . . he delivered them to be stoned&quot; 
  (Josephus,<i> Antiquities of the Jews</i>, Book XVIII, ch. V, p. 20; Book XX, 
  ch. IX, p. 140 ). Again we have sources external to the Bible that demonstrate 
  the historical reliability of the text. Josephus, who was probably alive during 
  the time of Christ, is attesting to the reality of his existence. What this 
  also tells us is that within 40 years of Christ's death, the knowledge of who 
  he was was widespread enough that Josephus could reference him and expect his 
  readers to know exactly who he was talking about.</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Accuracy of the Biblical Records</h3>
<p>The question often arises when discussing the biblical records, &quot;How can 
  a document that has been copied over and over possibly be reliable? Everyone 
  knows there are tons of errors in it.&quot; While it is true that the documents 
  have been copied many times, we often have misconceptions about how they were 
  transmitted. All ancient documents were copied by hand before the advent of 
  the printing press in the 16th century. Great care was exercised in reproducing 
  these manuscripts. When we think of copying manuscripts we often assume that 
  one copy was made and then another from that and another from that and so on, 
  each replacing the copy it was reproduced from. This is not how manuscripts 
  copying worked. Copyists were usually working from one or two documents that 
  were very old. They would make many copies of their source copy, all the while 
  preserving their source and comparing the copies they have made. </p>
<p>Josephus tells how the Jews copied the Old Testament. &quot;We have given practical 
  proof of our reverence for our own Scriptures. For although such long ages have 
  now passed, no one has ventured either to add, or to remove, or to alter a syllable; 
  and it is an instinct with every Jew, from the day of his birth, to regard them 
  as the decrees of God, to abide by them, and, if need be, cheerfully to die 
  for them&quot; (Against Apion, Book I, sec., 8, p. 158). Josephus statement 
  is no exaggeration. The Jewish copyists knew exactly how many letters where 
  in every line of every book and how many times each word occurred in each book. 
  This enabled them to check for errors (Shelly<i>, Prepare to Answer</i>, p. 
  133). The Jews believed that adding any mistake to the Scriptures would be punishable 
  by Hell. This is not like the modern secretary who has many letters to type 
  and must work hard to keep their job, and consequently feels that mistakes are 
  inevitable. Great care is exercised with scriptures when someone holds a conviction 
  such as this. </p>
<p>But even with the great amount of care exercised in copying, errors have crept 
  into the manuscripts. No one questions that spelling errors, misplaced letters, 
  and word omissions have occurred. What is not true is that these errors have 
  gradually built up over time so that our copies look nothing like the originals. 
  This view was commonly held until recently.</p>
<p>In 1947 the accuracy of these documents was confirmed by the Dead Sea Scrolls. 
  These scrolls were found in caves in the dessert near the Dead Sea by a shepherd 
  boy. Before the discovery of these scrolls, the earliest Old Testament manuscripts 
  we had were from about 980 A.D. The manuscripts discovered in the caves dated 
  from 250 B.C. to shortly after the time of Christ. In careful comparison of 
  the manuscripts it was confirmed that the copies we had were almost precisely 
  the same as those which date over 1000 years earlier. Old Testament scholar 
  Gleason Archer said that even though there is such a difference in dates of 
  the manuscripts, &quot;they proved to be word for word identical with our standard 
  Hebrew Bible in more that 95 per cent of the text. The 5 per cent of variation 
  consisted chiefly of obvious slips of the pen and variations in spelling.&quot; 
  No other historical literature has been so carefully preserved and historically 
  confirmed.</p>
<p>When we come to the New Testament we see a similar phenomenon. There are over 
  5,000 Greek New Testament manuscripts in existence. This is by far more than 
  any other historical documents, which usually have maybe a dozen copies from 
  very late dates. The New Testament manuscripts are many and old and they are 
  spread over a wide geographical area. What this enables the New Testament historian 
  to do is collect manuscripts from Jerusalem and Egypt and Syria and other places 
  and compare them for variations. And variations do exist, but as with the Old 
  Testament they are relatively few and rarely important to the meaning of the 
  text. What these manuscripts demonstrate is that different families of texts 
  existed very early that were copied from the original or good copies of the 
  original. This allows us to trace the manuscripts back to the source as one 
  would follow the branches of a tree to get to the trunk. Aside from the manuscripts 
  themselves, &quot;virtually the entire New Testament could be reproduced from 
  citations contained in the works of the early church fathers. There are some 
  thirty-two thousand citations in the writings of the Fathers prior to the Council 
  of Nicea (325)&quot; (Moreland, <i>Scaling the Secular City</i>, p. 136).</p>
<hr>
<h3>Historical Reliability</h3>
<p>There is one more important feature of the Bible to examine before we move 
  to the evidence of Christ's resurrection, that is their historical reliability. 
  Unfortunately I cannot go into the history of this topic. Many critics have 
  challenged the historical accuracy of the Bible and have been proved wrong. 
  Let me provide one example. Historians questioned the accuracy of the accounts 
  surrounded Pontius Pilate's crucifixion of Jesus. Pilate found nothing wrong 
  with him and was reluctant to crucify an innocent man. The Jews put pressure 
  on Pilate saying that if you refuse this &quot;you are no friend of Caesar&quot; 
  (John 19:12). At which point Pilate gave in to the Jews. This did not fit any 
  historical records we had of Pilate who was a cruel and dominating man, not 
  likely to give in to a group of Jews whom he hated. Many believed that this 
  account was historically inaccurate because of the way in which it portrayed 
  Pilate.</p>
<p>Later it was discovered that Pilate had been appointed by a man named Sejanus 
  who was plotting to overthrow Caesar. Sejanus was executed along with many of 
  his appointees (Delashmutt, <i>Sejanus</i>, p. 55, 56). What this demonstrated 
  was that Pilate was in no position to get in trouble with Rome. The Jews had 
  him in a tight place. If word returned to Rome that Jerusalem was in rebellion, 
  Pilate would be the first to go. The gospel account was confirmed as accurate. 
</p>
<p>Many facts recorded in the Bible have been challenged with the same result, 
  later archeology confirms the reliability of the biblical records down to the 
  smallest detail. A respected Jewish archaeologist has claimed that, &quot;It 
  may be stated categorically that no archaeological discovery has ever controverted 
  a biblical reference&quot; (Shelly, p. 103). This is a strong statement for 
  any archaeologist to make because if it were not true, he would quickly be condemned 
  in his own field.</p>
<p>The conclusion that one draws from this material is that the Bible is a reliable 
  historical document. Its accuracy has been proved numerous times. Its historical 
  inaccuracy has never been demonstrated. So that when we approach the Bible, 
  we do so with a good amount of confidence that what it records actually happened. 
  If this is true, then we need to come to terms about what the Bible claims. 
  We cannot dismiss it out of hand because we were not there, regardless of the 
  difficulty of what is said.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Miracles and Modern Man</h3>
<p>This brings us to the issue of miracles. The Bible records many miracles occurring 
  over a period of more than 4000 years. It is easy to get the misconception that 
  miracles were common occurrences in the biblical times. This is not the case. 
  It is the nature of history to record events out of the ordinary. The Bible 
  is no exception. The very reason that these things were recorded is because 
  they were unusual occurrences of supernatural activity. </p>
<p>We must be careful, however, when we approach the Bible to be willing to entertain 
  the idea that something outside of what we see, hear, and feel <i>could</i> 
  exists. All of these sensory experiences are in the realm of science. But science, 
  which deals with the laws of nature, can say nothing of the <i>super</i>natural. 
  Science has its limits -- especially in the area of the miraculous -- because 
  miracles are by definition non-repeatable, non-natural, and non-ordinary events. 
  If miracles exist and if they function as I've described, then we would not 
  expect everyone to have experienced a miracle in their lifetime. </p>
<p>We cannot rule out miracles because we have never personally witnessed one. 
  In other words it is wrong to reason that a miracle cannot occur on logical 
  grounds (by reason alone) because one has never seen one (something that can 
  only be validated by experience). It is certainly possible that supernatural 
  events have indeed taken place throughout the history of mankind. And it is 
  better to come with an attitude that maintains that it might be possible and 
  with reliable witnesses we may be convinced that something supernatural has 
  taken place. Let's leave this question open.</p>
<p>Those who lived a long time ago were not necessarily more gullible than we 
  are. We commonly assume that ancient peoples believed miracles occurred regularly. 
  This is not true in the sense that we use the term miracle. They certainly wouldn't 
  have been able to explain as much about the natural world as we can. But this 
  does not make them ignorant individuals willing to believe any abnormal event 
  is a supernatural occurrence. They were awed by things that we can explain using 
  the &quot;laws of nature.&quot; But they were also aware of a difference between 
  things that occurred naturally, such as lightning, and those which didn't, such 
  as people rising from the dead. They were men who lived day to day without these 
  amazing experiences just as we do. </p>

<h3>The Biblical Record</h3>
<p>At this point I would like to move on to the direct evidences for the resurrection 
  of Christ. There are a certain number of historical facts that we can glean 
  from the biblical records. They are: Jesus died by crucifixion, he was buried 
  in a tomb known to the authorities, his disciples were distraught because of 
  his death, his tomb was found empty, the disciples believed that they saw Jesus 
  risen from the grave, this experience changed their lives, the message was central 
  to early church teachings, and it was preached in the very city in which Jesus 
  died (Miethe, <i>Did Jesus Rise from the Dead?</i>, p. 19, 20). These historical 
  facts will be the basis of our argument for Jesus' resurrection.</p>
<p>Jesus died by crucifixion. Crucifixion was a most painful and certain means 
  of death. Christ was whipped by Roman soldiers before his crucifixion (Mt 27:26-31). 
  The Roman method for this was to give thirty-nine lashes before crucifixion. 
  (Forty lashes was considered legally dead after which point an individual could 
  no longer be punished.) The effect of this was to induce considerable blood 
  loss. The Romans used what was called a &quot;cat-of-nine-tails.&quot; This 
  whip had many ends to it and usually had pieces of bone, glass, and metal shards 
  attached to it which would rip open the flesh. After being whipped Jesus was 
  forced to carry his own cross to the place of crucifixion. The gospel records 
  indicate that in his weakened state, he was unable to carry the cross (which 
  would have been carried on his wounded back Mt 27:32). Incidentally, Jesus was 
  probably not a weak man. Before his preaching ministry he had been a carpenter 
  and during his ministry he walked hundreds of miles throughout Israel.</p>
<p>Jesus was then nailed to a Roman cross at which point his death came within 
  hours. The Jews were concerned that no bodies would be left on crosses at sundown 
  that evening because it was the beginning of the Sabbath. &quot;The Jews therefore, 
  because it was the day of preparation, so that the bodies should not remain 
  on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), asked Pilate 
  that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away&quot; (Jn 
  19:31). Crucifixion victims, depending on their health and the method of crucifixion, 
  could last days on a cross. Victims died primarily through blood loss, dehydration, 
  and suffocation. In order to breath when on a cross, it is necessary for the 
  victim to push up with their legs to release the pressure on the lungs. This 
  is a painful process because of the nails in both the hands and feet or ankles. 
  The purpose of breaking the victims legs was so that they would be unable to 
  push themselves up to breath and thus dies more quickly.</p>
<p>However, when they came to Jesus the Roman guards realized he was dead already. 
  &quot;The soldiers therefore came, and broke the legs of the first man, and 
  of the other man who was crucified with Him; but coming to Jesus, when they 
  saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs; but one of the soldiers 
  pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water&quot; 
  (Jn 19:32-34). John records this detail of piercing Jesus side to indicate that 
  he was in fact dead. In an article published in the <i>Journal of the American 
  Medical Association</i> the doctors examining the historical evidence concluded 
  that the spear probably pierced the sack of fluid that surrounds the heart (JAMA, 
  Vol., 255, No. 11, 1986, p. 1455ff ). If he had not been dead before this time, 
  he was surely dead now. </p>
<p>The gospel records indicate that upon his death two prominent Jewish admirers 
  came to gather Christ's body. &quot;And after these things Joseph of Arimathea, 
  being a disciple of Jesus, but a secret one, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate 
  that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate granted permission. And 
  Nicodemus came also, who had first come to Him by night; bringing a mixture 
  of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds weight&quot; (Jn 19:38). These men 
  were both of the ruling class of the Jews (seventy-one men in all) and well 
  known in the community as well as to Pilate. The mention of prominent men indicates 
  that this account is not fictitious. If the disciples had created this story 
  it would have been counterproductive to make up a person that was supposed to 
  be in a prominent position. This could easily have been refuted were it not 
  true. (Moreland, p. 167). </p>
<p>&quot;And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid 
  it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a large 
  stone against the entrance of the tomb and went away. And Mary Magdalene was 
  there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the grave&quot; (Mt 27:59-61). Archaeological 
  evidence confirms the description of this tomb being that of a rich man, which 
  was rare in this day. The probable location described in the gospels correlates 
  with the specific location of the Garden Gate at the north Wall of Jerusalem 
  where tombs have been excavated like those described in which Jesus was laid 
  (<i>Ibid</i>.)</p>
<p>There are some important features to this account. First, this was not a poor 
  man's grave. Only the rich had tombs carved in rock and situated in a garden 
  area. Second, the tomb was identified by Joseph, Nicodemus, and the women who 
  watched where he was buried. The grave is also carefully marked by the Jewish 
  and Roman authorities as this same passage records, </p>
<p>Now on the next day, which is the one after the preparation, the chief priests 
  and the Pharisees gathered together with Pilate, and said, &quot;Sir, we remember 
  that when He was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I am to rise 
  again.' Therefore give orders for the grave to be made secure until the third 
  day, lest the disciples come and steal Him away and say to the people, 'He has 
  risen from the dead,' and the last deception will be worse than the first&quot; 
  Pilate said to them, &quot;You have a guard; go, make it as secure as you know 
  how.&quot; And they went and made the grave secure, and along with the guard 
  they set a seal on the stone. (Mt 27:62-66)</p>
<p>It is also important to note here, that a Roman guard is a group of soldiers 
  not an individual. The seal which was placed over the grave was a wax seal with 
  rope, to break this Roman seal was punishable by death in the Roman empire.</p>
<p>We know also that the disciples were very disillusioned by Jesus' death. The 
  man they had followed around Israel for three years, whom they believed would 
  be the next ruler of the nation, had just been crucified. They had expected 
  a Messiah who would be king, not a criminal to be convicted and killed in the 
  most humiliating way. They probably felt that their lives had been wasted for 
  the past few years and they had publicly been made fools. Of course, they realized 
  that what they had experienced with Christ for the last three years was significant. 
  But how and what was significant, they did not yet understand. The disciples 
  scattered when Christ was arrested in the garden of Gethsemene (Mrk 14:50ff). 
  Peter denied ever knowing Jesus during his &quot;trial&quot; on the night before 
  his crucifixion (Mrk 14:66ff). The disciples were ready to return to their lives 
  as fishermen because they thought it was over (Jn 21:3). </p>
<p>Three days after his burial the tomb was found empty. Each of the gospels reports 
  that Jesus' tomb was found empty (Mt 28: 1-10, Mrk 16:1-8, Lk 24: 1-3; Jn 20:1-10). 
  &quot;But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, 
  bringing the spices which they had prepared. And they found the stone rolled 
  away from the tomb, but when they entered, they did not find the body of the 
  Lord Jesus&quot; (Lk 24:1-3). When it had been reported to the disciples by 
  Mary that the tomb was empty, they came running:</p>
<p>Simon Peter therefore came, following him, and entered the tomb and he beheld 
  the linen wrappings lying there, and the face-cloth, which had been on His head, 
  not lying with the linen wrappings, but rolled up in a place by itself. So the 
  other disciple who had first come to the tomb entered then also, and he saw 
  and believed [that the body was gone]. For as yet they did not understand the 
  Scripture, that He must rise again from the dead. So the disciples went away 
  again to their own homes. (Jn 20:6-10)</p>
<p>This recording is significant, but what is more significant is that the events 
  which followed Jesus' resurrection bear witness to the fact that his body was 
  indeed missing. </p>
<p>An historical question confronts us at this point. What happened to the body. 
  Scholars have generally agreed that the body was indeed gone and many explanations 
  have been put forth to account for this fact. The most common response is that 
  it was indeed stolen. But this view is hampered with many problems. Who would 
  have stolen it? The Jews would not want to steal it. It was they that posted 
  the Roman guard and they had the most to gain by ensuring that Jesus stayed 
  in his tomb and his teachings died with him. The Romans really had no motivation. 
  It was in Pilate's best interest as a governor whose job was in jeopardy to 
  keep his realm quiet, not to mention that the Romans hated the Jewish religious 
  fanaticism. </p>
<p>The only reasonable explanation for the missing body is that the disciples 
  stole it. But is this plausible? These are the same men who scattered when Jesus 
  was arrested. They were cowardly. They were disillusioned and depressed. And 
  they would need to overpower the Roman guards. It is not likely that they would 
  have had the courage or motivation to carry out such a plan. Why would they 
  steal it? Possibly they wanted to start a new religion, to gain fame and fortune. 
  This is possible but not likely as we will see. The disciples would have put 
  themselves in great risk to steal the body. The Jews and Romans both wanted 
  this disruption stopped, had they believed that the disciples stole the body 
  they would have dragged them into prison and beaten them until they confessed 
  and produced the body. No such thing happened.</p>
<p>A number of incidental details in this account bear the markings of history 
  as opposed to fraud or fiction. The gospels do not portray the disciples in 
  a very glamorous light. If the disciples had propagated this myth we would expect 
  their own accounts of the events to paint them in a better light than we actually 
  see them in. The disciples were not the first to see the risen Christ rather, 
  a group of women were. The disciples were very reluctant to believe that Jesus 
  was alive again when the women reported what they had seen. &quot;Now they were 
  Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James; also the other women 
  with them were telling these things to the apostles. And these words appeared 
  to them as nonsense, and they would not believe them&quot; (Lk 24:10,11). Thomas 
  response was, &quot;Unless I shall see in His hands the imprint of the nails, 
  and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into His side, 
  I will not believe&quot; (Jn 20:25). These men knew that when someone died, 
  they were dead. Thomas was no fool. </p>
<p>It is of crucial importance to notice in all the accounts that the women were 
  the first to see the risen Jesus (Jn 20:11-17; Lk 24:1-9; Mrk 16:1-8; Mt 28:1-7). 
  In the first century women had no legal power as witnesses in a court of law. 
  A woman's testimony was unacceptable. But it is to the women that Jesus first 
  appears. If the story is fabricated, why choose women, whose testimony no one 
  would accept, to be the first witnesses? Instead of being a story concocted 
  by the disciples for their own gain, it appears to be an historical record of 
  what actually took place. </p>
<p>When Peter stuck his head in the tomb he saw something unique that made him 
  realize that something out of the ordinary had happened there. He saw the linen 
  wrappings that Joseph and Nicodemus had used to coat the body. This was done 
  by wrapping the body, head to foot, in cloth and caking on the spices and burial 
  ointments which would be reapplied in succeeding days to help the smell of decomposition. 
  Peter probably saw the wrappings in the shape of a body without a body inside. 
  But he also saw the head cloth, &quot;rolled up in a place by itself.&quot; 
  No one stealing the body would have had time to roll up the face cloth and carefully 
  set it aside. This is a curious detail that caught Peter's attention.</p>
<p>But this was only a foreshadowing of what was to come as Peter and the others 
  personally experienced Jesus Christ in the succeeding days. </p>
<p>And while they were telling these things, He Himself stood in their midst. 
  But they were startled and frightened and thought they were seeing a spirit. 
  And He said to them, &quot;Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in 
  your hearts? See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; touch Me and see, 
  for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.&quot; (Lk 
  23:36-39)</p>
<p>This is no less remarkable for us today than it was for them. And we can understand 
  their reluctance to accept him. But they came to believe that they had witnessed 
  something unique as Jesus appeared to them many times over a period of four 
  days. These experiences had a profound impact on their lives.</p>
<p>How their lives changed after they had seen the risen Jesus is another mark 
  of the story's truthfulness. The disciples became the forerunners of a new movement 
  that swept the world. They spoke out for the message. They were persecuted for 
  the message and they ultimately gave their lives for this message: Jesus Christ 
  rose from the dead. Reliable historical sources tell us that all twelve of the 
  disciples except John died as martyrs. Peter was crucified in Rome. Paul was 
  beheaded. And James was stoned to death, to name a few. This is of crucial importance. 
  If they had pulled off a hoax, why would they go to their graves proclaiming 
  that it actually happened. Certainly, many have died for a lie. Nazis gave their 
  lives for what was false. Plenty of other religious followers have died for 
  their faith, but the crucial point here is that the disciples would have known 
  it was a lie, if they had stolen the body or made up the story. They all would 
  have died for what they <i>knew </i>was a lie. Is it plausible to believe that 
  not one of them, under the threat of death would have admitted, &quot;we made 
  the whole thing up?&quot; What they saw changed their lives. They believed they 
  had seen Jesus Christ rise from the dead.</p>
<p>And because of what they believed they saw, these men who were meek suddenly 
  became powerful spokesmen for Jesus Christ. Peter who denied Christ a few weeks 
  earlier preached to over three thousand people in Acts 2. </p>
<p>Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to 
  you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God performed through Him 
  in your midst, just as you yourselves know--[he is appealing to their common 
  knowledge of Jesus and what he did] this man, delivered up by the predetermined 
  plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless 
  men and put Him to death. And God raised Him up again, putting and end to the 
  agony of death, since it was impossible for Him to be held in its power. (Acts 
  2:22-24)</p>
<p>Not only were they now bold spokesmen, but of a fundamentally different religion 
  than Judaism. For a Jew of the first century to change his religion or preach 
  some heretical doctrine would be to risk eternal damnation. (Moreland, p. 172). 
  For us in the twentieth century, we are not surprised by new religions, but 
  this kind of hoax is almost unthinkable in first century Judaism whose culture 
  and beliefs changed slowly (<i>Ibid</i>., p. 180). They were convinced that 
  what they saw and experienced was true. </p>
<p>What did the disciples see? Could they have seen a vision that they assumed 
  was the risen Christ? Could it have been an hallucination. Because of the strength 
  of the evidence that something did happen that changed the disciples' lives, 
  some critics have suggested the idea that what they saw was an hallucination. 
  There are two problems with this theory: it doesn't match what we know of the 
  account and it doesn't match what we know of the psychology of hallucinations.</p>
<p>J.P. Moreland summarizes the nature of hallucinations well.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>First, hallucinations happen to persons who are high-strung, highly imaginative, 
    and nervous. Second, they are linked in an individual's subconscious to his 
    past beliefs and experiences. Third, it is extremely unlikely that two or 
    more people would have the same hallucination at the same time. Fourth, they 
    usually occur at particular places (places of nostalgia which create a reminiscing 
    mood) and they recur over a long period of time. (p. 177)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would add further that the idea of mass hallucinations has been disproven 
  in modern psychology. If you hold that what the disciples saw was an hallucination, 
  then you must acknowledge that they experienced this hallucination in groups 
  of three, four, twelve, and even five hundred people. </p>
<p>The hallucination theory does not fit what we know of the disciples' expectations. 
  As I have said earlier, the disciples were not expecting Christ to rise from 
  the dead. They had no concept in Judaism of the Messiah rising physically from 
  the dead with the same body, a body they could touch and interact with. Nor 
  do the descriptions given in the gospels reflect the kind of vagueness that 
  makes up an hallucination. What they experienced was concrete. They could recall 
  and explain it clearly. And because many of them experienced the same thing, 
  separately and together, they could confirm their experiences with each other.</p>
<p>The hallucination theory also fails to explain one other fact: the empty tomb. 
  Had the disciples, and many others, hallucinated Jesus' appearances, the commotion 
  they were causing in Jerusalem could have been easily stopped by producing the 
  body. This is an argument from silence. In other words, there is nothing said 
  in history about whether the Romans and Jews tried to produce Jesus' body. But 
  it is crucial in this case that there is nothing said in recorded history about 
  what happened to Jesus' body other than what we find in the gospels. Had Jesus' 
  body been exhumed by the Jews or Romans and presented to the mass of people 
  who were deluded about his resurrection, it is hard to believe that the early 
  church could have gotten started. But the movement did start and the resurrection 
  of Jesus was the grounds on which it began. </p>
<p>Jesus resurrection from the dead was central to their faith. Peter preached 
  the message in Jerusalem as Acts chapter 2 goes on to say, &quot;Brethren, I 
  may confidently say to you regarding the patriarch David that he both died and 
  was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.&quot; Peter is saying that 
  we know where David's body is. We can go and dig it up. But Jesus' body is missing. 
  Had this not been true, anyone in the audience could have refuted his claim. 
  The Jews or the Romans could have opened the tomb and paraded the body through 
  the city to show everyone that the disciples' message was false. But they didn't 
  because there was no body to find and all of Jerusalem had heard the news (Lk 
  24:18). Even the Jewish historian Josephus writing forty years later comments 
  on Jesus' death. </p>
<p>It is important to note that the message was preached, not in a remote location 
  where no one could verify the account, but it was preached in Jerusalem where 
  all of these events took place and where the story could have easily been falsified 
  or verified. </p>
<p>It is from this location that the church grew. The movement grew very quickly. 
  Acts records three thousand people being baptized in one day (Acts 2:41). On 
  another occasion five thousand people came to believe (Acts 4:4). This corresponds 
  to what we know of the growth of the early church and it is one of the reasons 
  historians do not suspect that Jesus was a legend. Legends take many years to 
  accumulate and gain acceptance. Christianity spread immediately. The Jewish 
  authorities were unable to contain its growth because it was so rapid.</p>
<p>The resurrection of Christ is central to the Christian faith. Without it, there 
  is no Christianity. Paul says, &quot;if Christ has not been raised, then our 
  preaching is vain, your faith also is vain&quot; (I Cor:15:14). Paul who was 
  a vigorous persecutor of the church before seeing the risen Christ maintains 
  that Jesus did rise from the dead. In writing to the Corinthian church he says, 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>[F]or I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that 
    Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, 
    and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that 
    He appeared to Cephas [Peter], then to the twelve. After that He appeared 
    to more than five hundred brethren at one time, most of whom remain until 
    now, but some have fallen asleep [died]; then He appeared to James, then to 
    all the apostles; and last of all . . . He appeared to me also. <br>
    (I Cor 15:3-8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What he is telling his readers is that many people saw Jesus after the resurrection. 
  He is saying, &quot;if you are skeptical you can go and speak with them yourselves 
  because most of them are still alive!&quot; Paul is so confident of what he 
  and the others saw that he is willing to stake everything on this claim. This 
  was not an event that occurred to a few men in a remote location. It happened 
  in a huge metropolitan city and there were many witnesses to verify it.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Our Response</h3>
<p>Christians stake their entire faith on the resurrection of Christ because it 
  is only through this event that forgiveness can come. The gospels and the historical 
  evidence bear out this claim that Jesus rose from the dead. The question is 
  what will you do with the evidence? It has been God's practice to give evidence 
  to those who are willing to respond. Christ appeared to his disciples because 
  they were willing to believe when given enough evidence. He will not give evidence 
  to those who refuse to believe.</p>
<p>And after eight days again His disciples were inside, and Thomas with them. 
  Jesus came, the doors having been shut, and stood in their midst, and said, 
  &quot;Peace be with you.&quot; Then He said to Thomas, &quot;Reach here your 
  finger, and see My hands; and reach here your hand, and put it into my side; 
  and be not unbelieving, but believing.&quot; Thomas answered and said to Him, 
  &quot;My Lord and my God!&quot; (Jn 20:26-28)</p>
<p>Thomas was willing to accept the evidence he saw. The question is, how much 
  evidence will it take for us. As Christ states in the very next verse, &quot;Because 
  you have seen Me, have you believed? Blessed are they who did not see, and yet 
  believed.&quot;</p>
<p>There is much more evidence for the truth of Christ's message than is presented 
  here. This is only a brief sketch of some of the historical evidence. There 
  is also the evidence of fulfilled prophecy from the Old Testament, as well as 
  other kinds. The point is that the evidence exists. If the evidence is weak 
  and unconvincing, then we can throw Christianity out and look elsewhere. But 
  if it is true, the message of Jesus Christ applies to us. And we must be willing 
  to submit to it, regardless of what it says about us. </p>
<p>God demands humility from us. If he is indeed our Maker, we cannot approach 
  Him with an attitude that is arrogant and demanding. We must approach Him on 
  His terms. Christ spelled out those terms: mankind is in rebellion toward God 
  and in need of forgiveness. This is exactly what Christ came to offer. &quot;Truly, 
  truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has 
  eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into 
  life (Jn 5:24). And also, &quot;I came that they might have life, and might 
  have it abundantly&quot; (Jn 10:10). </p>

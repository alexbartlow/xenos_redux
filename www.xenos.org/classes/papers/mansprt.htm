<h3>Christian leaders should develop a crystal clear theology of
  sanctification. This must include very definite convictions about the following questions:
  What is man's part in sanctification? What is God's part? What is the Law's part? This
  paper deals with the first and third questions. The second has to do with the ministries
  of the Holy Spirit, and our position in Christ. These will be covered elsewhere.</h3>
<hr>

<h3 class="style1">Man's Part in Sanctification</h3>

<p class="style1">The Bible teaches that there is a continuity between sanctification and justification
(Col. 2:6; Gal. 3:3)--both are by grace through faith. Specifically, man's part in
sanctification consists of three distinct responsibilities. All three should be carefully
defined, understood, and taught regularly, along with God's part. Each area can be summed
up by one key word for memory purposes. 
<ul class="style1">
  <li><b>SEEK</b> - It is not only that we are <i>willing </i>to be sanctified, but that we <i>want
    </i>to be! Therefore, we advocate the use of the word &quot;seek&quot; rather than the
    passive concept of &quot;being willing.&quot; Those who assume that God will sanctify them
    one way or the other even if they don't particularly want it are wrong! Three words are
    important in defining what kind of seeking is effective: <ul>
      <li><b>Active</b> - This is the opposite of a passive mentality. It speaks of volition in
        the positive sense, and implies action. The idea of effort cannot be excluded at this
        level. However, there is a difference between effort to perform works and effort to
        cultivate the right attitude. The former has to do with behavior; the latter has to do
        with will. </li>
      <li><b>Earnest</b> - God knows the difference between lip-service and real desire. If we are
        only going through the motions, He will leave us alone until our need intensifies. </li>
      <li><b>Persistent</b> - Unlike justification, where we present ourselves once for all, in
        sanctification there are regular opportunities to present ourselves to God. The
        presentation we made last week doesn't apply to today's decision. According to Romans
        6:13, we have the option of presenting ourselves to God as slaves of righteousness. If we
        fail to do this the opposite will usually occur--we are automatically presented as slaves
        of sin. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>BELIEVE</b> - The content of our belief in the area of sanctification is very
    important. <ul>
      <li>First of all, we must believe that God <i>can</i> deal with our sin problems, and that
        He <i>will</i> deal with them. If we have a fatalistic attitude, to the effect that we
        will always live in a relatively defeated state, we probably will. The young believer
        needs to be alerted to the fact that Satan will attack his mind at this point. This is
        especially true after a failure has occurred. We have to learn to review the relevant
        biblical promises, and rely on them rather than our defeated feelings. </li>
      <li><b>Note</b>: Even if it is impossible to develop a <i>feeling</i> of confidence in God's
        sanctifying power, it is still possible to believe. We have to take note of our doubtful
        or distrustful feelings and pass judgment on them (II Cor 10:5). It is possible to say,
        &quot;Even though I feel like I will never change, I recognize that as a lie, and I elect
        to believe your Word.&quot; </li>
      <li>A second area of content is belief that God has freed us from the authority of our sin
        natures (Rom. 6:6). In other words, the believer must have a strong sense of his identity
        (position) &quot;in Christ.&quot; We are not trying to believe that it is <i>impossible</i>
        for us to sin, but that it is <i>incongruous</i> for us to sin. The more we know about,
        and believe in, our position in Christ, the less power sin will have in our lives (see
        also Col. 3:1-3 &amp; Eph. 4:17-25ff.). </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>RECEIVE</b> - The changing power of God does not usually come to us mystically like
    radio waves. Neither are dramatic experiences the normal mode of spiritual growth. On the
    other hand, both of these can contribute. Most of the time, sanctifying grace comes
    through defined channels. These channels can be called the &quot;means of growth.&quot;
    There is nothing in the Bible which indicates that the regular use of the means of growth
    is God's responsibility. Neither can we expect sanctification without them. Partaking in
    the means of growth should not be viewed as &quot;works&quot; sanctification, but as
    active receiving of grace. The means of growth emphasized in the Bible are prayer, the
    Word, Body-life, and the discipline of the Holy Spirit. (The Reformed and the Roman
    Catholics also accept that communion and the law are means of growth.) <ul>
      <li><b>Note</b>: The use of three out of four means of growth will not result in 75%
        sanctification. Instead, it may eventually result in a complete breakdown of the growth
        process. Most people will realize that spiritual growth is not possible without prayer,
        but do they realize that the same thing applies to the other means of growth? In addition,
        the discipline of the Spirit may be viewed as God's responsibility, but we are responsible
        for our reaction to it. An incorrect response to God's discipline can render it totally
        ineffective. </li>
      <li>Emphasize that you cannot get by neglecting the means of grace that you're weak in!! The
        majority of spiritual problems can be traced back to this failure &amp; the previous two.
        Apply Jas 1:21ff to this. The reason for our lack of spiritual vitality is usually
        embarrassingly simple. We're looking for some exotic reason (childhood; satanic attack;
        etc.) - when we're not praying, in the Word, in fellowship, responding to conviction - or
        have an unbelieving attitude. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3 class="style1">The Role of the Law in Sanctification</h3>

<p class="style1">The following passages will also demonstrate the role of the law in sanctification. We
see two basic roles that the law plays. 
<ol class="style1">
  <li>The law has a negative role similar to the role that it plays in justification. That is
    the role of convincing the believer of the hopelessness of his sin nature, and of his need
    for the outside power of God. This is the Romans 7, or &quot;law school&quot; concept.
    This use of the law is not well understood by those who have been taught in the
    institutional church. </li>
  <li>The Old Testament law does not apply to the Christian except where it illustrates the
    character of God, and as such is always binding on the whole universe. Therefore, there is
    a certain validity to the &quot;moral law&quot; distinction in the Mosaic code. Another
    important distinction is that between Old Testament moral principles and case law. It is
    the moral principles that still apply, not the case laws. <br>
    <br>
    Even with the moral principles, it is important to realize that they are not approached in
    the Old Testament way as something that we attempt to perform by our own power (see Heb.
    8:8-13). There is a difference between this legal approach to the law and the approach
    that recognizes our own impotence to perform it. Viewed in this way, moral imperatives
    serve to give content to our &quot;seeking&quot; (see above), whether they are from the
    Old or New Testament. It isn't enough to say in general, &quot;I want to be
    sanctified.&quot; God presents us with area after area and waits for specific volitional
    action on our part. This action may take the form, for instance, of praying that God will
    effect the prescribed changes. Another necessary act of the will may be to a step of faith
    in the direction indicated. God may call on us to replace old patterns of living, by being
    available to have our needs for stimulation, security, love, purpose and joy filled in
    healthy ways. </li>
  <li>Reformed theologians generally recognize the &quot;third use of the law&quot; which
    states that the Christian is &quot;under the law as a rule of faith and conduct.&quot; As
    stated in #2, we think this formulation is misleading and uninformative. It creates the
    impression that the Christian is under the moral law in the same way that the Old
    Testament believers were. It also argues that the law is a means of growth, which is
    contrary to New Testament teaching (Rom. 6:14; 7:4,6,10; II Cor 3:5,6; Heb 7:18,19). </li>
</ol>

<p></u><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Masoretic Text </b>(abbreviated MT) * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Masoretes (lit. transmitters of tradition) were Jewish
scholars (c. 500-1000 AD) responsible for preserving the text of the Hebrew Bible and
creating a system of vowel signs to provide a pronunciation guide for the consonantal text
of Hebrew scripture * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">They relied on older received manuscripts. * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Masoretic text is the product of that effort. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Megilloth</b> * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>Megilla</i> - scroll; from <i>galal</i> - to roll up * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The five megilloth are: Ruth, Canticles (Song of Solomon), <i>Ecclesiastes</i>,
Lamentations and Esther. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Midrash</b> * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Heb. - <i>midras</i>, &quot;to seek, examine,
investigate&quot; * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Refers both to a method of exposition and application of
the Torah as well as a collection of these expositions and applications. * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Ezra practiced this style b/c of his efforts to study and
apply the Torah * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>Haggadah midras</i> - interpreted non-legal materials in
an ethical and expository style; a distillation of principles from the Torah. * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>Halakah midras</i> - applied the general principles of
OT laws to specific situations; an application of the Torah in a kind of 'case law'
format. * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Midrash material was preserved orally for a long time * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">AD 100's the halakic midrashim were written down * </font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Mekilta - treatise to Exodus * </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Sifra - treatise to Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy * </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">AD 200's the haggadic midrashim were written down * </font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Treatise on Genesis followed later by Exodus, Leviticus,
  Numbers and Deuteronomy as well as the Megilloth * </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">These were known as the Midrash Rabbah </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Mishnah</b> * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">From Hebrew s<i>hana</i>, &quot;to repeat&quot; * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Refers both to a teaching technique emphasizing memory work
through continuous repetition and a commentary on the Torah that contained few direct
references to the Torah. * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Developed by the scribal school of the Hasidim * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Midrash study was not supplanted by the Mishnah
approach...both were used for halakic and haggadic areas * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Mishnah is a sort of collection of the works of
Sopherim, Hasidim, Zugot and Tannaim periods assembled and written down by Judah HaNasi c.
AD 200. * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Judah HaNasi did not compile all the Mishnah or Midrash
material into the document called the Mishnah * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Subsequent scholars pulled together the unpublished Mishnah
and Midrash material with their own commentaries in a document called the Gemara (Aramaic <i>gemara</i>
meaning &quot;completion&quot;) which serves as a commentary on the Judah HaNasi Mishnah *
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Gemara and Mishnah is together called the Targum or
Talmud </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Scribes</b> * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>sopherim</i> - scribal tradition running from Ezra
(c.450 BC to 180 BC) which produced the Midrashim * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>hasidim</i> - scribal tradition running through the
Maccabean age which produced the Mishnah * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">through the period of the hasidim, there were 5 pairs of
leaders known as the <i>Zugot</i> who developed instructional methods w/o direct reference
to the Law </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Septuagint </b>(abbreviated LXX meaning 'of the
seventy') * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The name derives from the apocryphal story found in a 2nd
century BC letter, <i>Letter of Aristeas</i>, who claimed it was the work of 72 scholars,
6 from each tribe of Israel. * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">A Greek translation of the Torah prepared 3 centuries
before the birth of Christ </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Talmud</b> * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">From <i>lamad</i>, &quot;to study,&quot; &quot;to
learn&quot; * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">An interpretation of the Law and a collection of wise
sayings; * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Developed in Alexandria after Babylon and Jerusalem were no
longer Jewish intellectual centers; comprised of the Jerusalem and Babylonian Targum with
additional commentaries * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Talmud is sometimes used interchangeably with Targum * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Circa 450 BC to AD 500 * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">See the notes on Mishnah, Midrash and Targum </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Targum</b> * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">from <i>targumim</i>, interpretations * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Interpretations or paraphrases of the Pentateuch * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Gemara and Mishnah is together called the Targum or
Talmud * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">There are two versions of the Targum: the Jerusalem (aka
Jonathan, AD 425) and the Babylonian (AD 500); the latter is 3x as long </font></p>

<p><a name="Literary Structure"><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>Literary Structure</b></font><font
face="Arial" size="3"> </font></a></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Often OT prophets delivered their message in verse. This
made the message more interesting and easier to remember. Below are some terms used to
describe attributes of these styles: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Acrostic Poetry</b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The first letter of each new line forms a recognizable
pattern (e.g. Ps.119, each new line begins with a letter of the Hebrew alphabet; see also
Ps.9/10,25,34,37,111,112,145). </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Alliteration </font></p>

<p></b><font face="Arial" size="3">Repetition of the same sound at the beginning of two or
more words in a series (e.g. &quot;Fields ever fresh and groves ever green&quot;).
Obviously, this style is only present in the language in which the text was initially
written. Once translated, the impact of alliteration is lost. Ps.22:4 <i>beka batehu...
batehu</i> ('in you...put their trust; they trusted) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Allegory</b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">An allegory is a sort of extended metaphor where two
different things are being compared for their similarities in an effort to clarify
something about the object of the allegory. In an allegory, each element of an account
represents a feature of the object of the allegory. &quot;Thus says the Lord my God,
'Pasture the flock doomed to slaughter. Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished,
and each of those who sell them says, 'Blessed be the Lord, for I have become rich.' And
their own shepherds have no pity on them'&quot; is an allegory from Zechariah.11:4. The
objects of this allegory are those who participate in the destruction of Israel...that
they treat Israel like a sheep herd and each element of the allegory directly applies to
these people. </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Antiphony </font></p>

<p></b><font face="Arial" size="3">An antiphonal psalm is a responsive psalm. The cantor
recites a line and the group responds (e.g. the great Hallel, Psalm 136) </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Aphorism </font></p>

<p></b><font face="Arial" size="3">A short pithy sentence (e.g. he's as good as dead). In
Isaiah 7:8, &quot;The head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is only
Rezin.&quot; </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Apostrophe </font></p>

<p></b><font face="Arial" size="3">An address directed toward a personification (e.g.
Ps.68:15-16). </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Assonance </font></p>

<p></b><font face="Arial" size="3">A partial rhyme in which the stressed vowel sounds are
alike but the consonant sounds are not (e.g. bike and light). In Micah 7:4 the word hedge,
<i>mesuka,</i> and the word confusion, <i>mebuka</i> are assonant words used to change
perspective from description to prediction. Isaiah describes the day of the Lord as a day
of tumult, <i>mehuma</i>, trampling, <i>mebusa</i> and terror, <i>mebuka</i> (22:5) using
assonance &amp; alliteration to make the prophecy tense and memorable to his listeners.
According to VanGemeren,<sup><a NAME="Ref1"></a><a HREF="#Note1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp; Psalm
44:7 displays assonance. Although he focuses upon the consonant sounds, sh, ts or s, which
occur in every word: <i>hosatanu missarenu umesanenu hebisota.</i> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Chiasm </b>(a.k.a. chiasmus) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">An inversion of the second of two parallel phrases (e.g. do
not live to eat but eat to live). Isaiah 1:19-20, &quot;you will eat the best...but if you
resist, you will be devoured,&quot; carries the chaismus, 'eat or be eaten.' Psalm 51:1a,
'have mercy...according to your love' forms a chiasm with 51:1b, 'according to your
compassion...blot out transgressions'. Psalm 6:9a, 'heard...my cry for mercy' forms a
chiasm with 6:9b, 'my prayer...accepts'. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Ellipsis</b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">This involves incomplete parallelism. The second phase in a
parallel line silently includes a clause from the previous line (e.g. Ps.88:6). Psalm
12:3, 'may the Lord cut off' belongs with both clauses but is only associated with the
first clause. </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Hendiadys </font></p>

<p></b><font face="Arial" size="3">A figure of speech wherein two sequential expressions
make the same point (Ps.107:10 - darkness {<i>hosek</i>} and deepest gloom {<i>salmawet</i>}
intensify the experience of anguish) OR (Ps.27:1 'the Lord is my light {<i>'or</i>} and my
salvation {<i>yesa</i>} intensify the joy of God's loving actions). </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Hyperbole </font></p>

<p></b><font face="Arial" size="3">An exaggeration meant to emphasize a point rather than
to be taken literally (e.g. The whole world is in an uproar over this teaching. This is as
old as time) (e.g. Ps.40:12). Some people take &quot;the lion shall lie down with the lamb
...&quot; prophecy in Isaiah 11:3-16 to be an hyperbole intended to emphasize the peace
and safety of the millennial kingdom. Others take it literally. </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Imagery </font></p>

<p></b><font face="Arial" size="3">The use of simile, metaphor mythic allusions or other
literary devices that conjure up mental images as they are read and pondered. Parallelism
and imagery are standard features of Hebrew poetry. Meter and rhyme, while important in
Western poetry, are not characteristic of Hebrew poetry </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Inclusion</b> (a.k.a. inclusio) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The opening and closing of a passage is the same or
similar. Inclusio serves as bookends to the entire passage between. It sets the mood for
the passage and brings it to a close (e.g. Ps. 8:1 &amp; 9; <i>Hallelu Yah</i>, <i>Praise
Yaweh</i> begins and ends Ps.106).<sup><a NAME="Ref2"></a><a HREF="#Note2">[2]</a></sup>
&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Merismus </font></p>

<p></b><font face="Arial" size="3">A use of words that are meant to represent the whole
population (e.g. Ps.105:14 <i>adam</i> (man) and <i>melakim</i> (kings) are used to mean
anyone/everyone). Ps. 121:2 'heaven &amp; earth' are meant to represent every created
thing. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Metaphor</b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">When unlike things are compared with each other to clarify
the meaning of one of those things. A metaphor is an extended simile without the clue
&quot;like&quot; or &quot;as.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;A mighty fortress is our God,&quot; is a metaphor
intended to communicate the protection available to all that put their trust in God. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;I am the door,&quot; is a metaphor intended to show
that Christ is the access point to God and to eternal life. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Its teeth are the teeth of a lion and it has the
fangs of a lioness,&quot; is a metaphor in Joel 1:6 intended to show the ferocity of
Judah's judgment. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">A <b>metonymy</b> is a simile or metaphor intended to
represent something (e.g. Ps.7:10 shield; Ps.22:15-16 potsherd, dogs). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Meter</b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Rhythmical writing that structures a poem. Hebrew poetry is
not metrical. English readers are apt to think that poetry must be metrical in order to be
poetry because much English poetry is that way. This definition is included here because
some older scholars tried to find metrical patterns in the Psalms. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Onomatopoeia</b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The formation of a word from the sound the object makes
(e.g. barking of a dog; hissing of a snake; roaring of an engine). In 17:12, &quot;...the
uproar of the peoples - they roar like the roaring of great waters,&quot; the 'm' and 'n'
sounds in <i>hamon</i> (uproar) and <i>seon</i> (roaring) sound like waves when read aloud
in Hebrew. In 42:14, &quot;like a woman in childbirth, I cry out (<i>pa 'ah</i>), I gasp (<i>nawsham</i>)
and pant (<i>sha' af</i>),&quot; are grunting, guttural words reminiscent of sounds made
by a woman during childbirth. </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Parable </font></p>

<p></b><font face="Arial" size="3">A parable is a fictional short story intended to
communicate some truth. Formal names are not part of parabolic writing; parables are short
and followed by an explanation (e.g. In 2 Sam.12:1ff Nathan tells David a parable about an
unjust rich man exploiting a poor man. David does not know it is a parable until Nathan
reveals that it is a parable about David's treatment of Uriah). </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Parallelism </font></p>

<p></b><font face="Arial" size="3">A standard literary device used in Hebrew poetry and
prose, although it is more frequently used in poetry. It involves the repetition and
extension of the ideas in one line by subsequent line(s). * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Semantic parallelism</b> involves the repetition and
extension of the ideas in one line by the next line. The categories of this kind of
parallelism include: synonymous parallelism; antithetic parallelism; synthetic
parallelism; emblematic parallelism; repetitive parallelism; pivot pattern and chiasm.<sup><a
NAME="Ref3"></a><a HREF="#Note3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp; * </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Grammatical parallelism</b> involves the repetition of
the parts of speech from one line to the next, although not necessarily in the same order
(e.g. <i>He rebukes them in his anger</i> {verb-direct object-prepositional phrase} <i>and
in his wrath he terrifies them </i>{prepositional phrase-verb-direct object}. This serves
to tie one line with another. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Parallelism and imagery are standard features of Hebrew
poetry. Meter and rhyme, while important in Western poetry, are not characteristic of
Hebrew poetry </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Personification </font></p>

<p></b><font face="Arial" size="3">The presentation of an idea or value through its
expression as a person (e.g. 'the wine he dries up, the field he mourns' Joel 1:10) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Recapitulation</b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">A short summary of points previously made. &quot;Awake
drunkards and weep; and wail, all you wine drinkers, on account of the sweet wine that is
cut off from your mouth,&quot; from Joel 1:5 is a recapitulation intended to emphasize the
nature of the audience. </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Simile </font></p>

<p></b><font face="Arial" size="3">When two unlike things are compared (e.g. she is like a
summer day). The terms, 'like' or 'as' are often used in such sentences. &quot;Their
appearance is like the appearance of horses,&quot; is a simile from Joel 2:4 intended to
communicate the swiftness of Israel's destruction. </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Strophe </font></p>

<p></b><font face="Arial" size="3">A stanza that is answered by another stanza - twist on
the first. </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Wordplay </font></p>

<p></b><font face="Arial" size="3">This is a clever exchange of words, a malapropism<sup><a
NAME="Ref4"></a><a HREF="#Note4">[4]</a></sup>&nbsp; or a pun. In Isaiah 13:6, &quot;...it
will come like <b>destruction</b> from the <b>Almighty,</b>&quot; both words derive from
the same root <i>sod</i>. The blow will be such that only God could have delivered it.
Micah has an entire series of puns in his prophecy about the destruction of several cities
of Judah (see Micah 1:8-15). <b>Paronomasia</b> is a form of wordplay where homonyms with
different nuances (Ps.44:15-17 <i>kol</i> (all), <i>qol</i> (sound or taunts) and <i>kol</i>
(all). <b>Antanaclasis</b> is a paronomasia where the words have contrasting meanings
(e.t. Ps.69:30-31 a song {<i>sir</i>} is better than a bull {<i>sor</i>}) </font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4"><a name="Schools of prophetic Interpretation"><b>Schools
of prophetic Interpretation</b></a> </font></strong></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Allegorical Interpretation </font></p>

<p></b><font face="Arial" size="3">Some schools of thought have attempted to assign an
allegorical meaning to prophetic passages. This makes interpretation of prophetic passages
so subjective and idiosyncratic as to render them meaningless. Sometimes the motivation
for this approach is the presupposition that supernatural events (e.g. like predictive
prophecy or miracles) cannot take place. </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Application Approaches </font></p>

<p></b><font face="Arial" size="3">In this case a prophecy from an earlier time is used
for its applicability to a contemporary situation. However, the person making the
application is not trying to suggest that the reference should be interpreted to refer to
the contemporary situation (e.g. don't muzzle the ox used by Paul to argue for the fiscal
support of elders but he is not trying to say that this law was written for the purpose of
elder fiscal support.). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Literal Interpretation</b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">This school of thought holds that supernatural events can
take place and thus the plain meaning of a passage is preferred. This approach should not
be confused with a literalistic method of interpretation. A literalistic approach would
require the reader to believe that Christ was an actual door when he said, <i>I am the
door</i>. This method of interpretation does recognize that predictive prophecies can be
quite challenging to interpret and thus acknowledges prophecy may have one of several
different forms. </font></p>

<p><a name="Prophetic forms"><strong><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>Prophetic forms</b></font></strong></a><font
face="Arial" size="3"> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Isaiah is cited many times in the New Testament and in
several of those cases the Isaiah passage is said to be fulfilled by some event in the
life of Christ. If we understand fulfillment in a narrow manner, that is, a prediction is
made and it comes to pass, then it will be difficult to reconcile these passages because
they clearly have meaning for Isaiah's times. It is helpful to recognize that the term
translated 'fulfill' has a broader meaning than this. The term 'fulfill' carries the
denotation, 'filled to the full' or 'complete.' Thus, it could be said that an event
fulfills an earlier statement because the theology of that is consonant with that of the
new event. Similarly, if an event finishes off or consummates an earlier event then it
could be said to be the fulfillment. For instance, Christ fulfills the Law because his
sacrifice is in accordance with the conditions of the Law and because his sacrifice
replaces it. </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Developmental or Gap Prophecies </font></p>

<p></b><font face="Arial" size="3">Some prophecies seem partially fulfilled in the near
term but only completely fulfilled later, perhaps in our future. These are referred to as
prophetic gaps. Daniel's 70 <i>weeks</i> prophecies are thought to include a gap between
the 69th 7 year period and the 70th 7 year period that extends into our own time. </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Double-reference Prophecies </font></p>

<p></b><font face="Arial" size="3">According to some scholars there are some prophecies
that have meaning in the context of the prophet but seem also to address events quite
removed from the times of the prophet. The first event/person to which the prophecy refers
is known as the <i>type</i>. The second event/person is the <i>antitype</i>. An opposing
school of thought holds that only one interpretation can be assigned to a prophecy
(Single-meaning). </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Type Prophecies </font></p>

<p></b><font face="Arial" size="3">People, events or objects that had a clear meaning in
their time but which served to foreshadow people, events or objects in the future (e.g.
the OT law and religious practices foreshadowed Christ; Abraham and Isaac foreshadowed God
offering Christ as a sacrifice). Much of the book of Hebrews is devoted to expounding the
type nature of the OT sacrificial system.</font></p>

<h2><a href="../../personal/gary.htm">Gary DeLashmutt</a> and <a href="../../personal/den.htm">Dennis McCallum</a></h2>
<hr>

<h3 class="style1">I. INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p class="style1">The purpose of this paper is to provide a documented overview of the major
&quot;Christian&quot; sects, or what some have called cults. We are using the term sects
to avoid the much more complicated concept of cults. Specific attention is given the
essential biblical doctrines which they deny. No information is given on the origin and
founders of the sects, since this is of relatively minor importance to the apologetic
task. Guidelines are supplied to help the Christian worker in his communication of this
information. An extensive bibliography is provided and recommended for further study.</p>

<hr>

<h3 class="style1">II. BIBLIOLOGY: THE SOURCE OF AUTHORITY</h3>

<p class="style1">The source of doctrinal authority for spiritual truth is crucial. The source(s) which a
group acknowledges will tend to determine the entire doctrinal framework of that group.
This area, therefore, is the foundational issue between biblical Christianity and the
sects. Biblical Christianity acknowledges the Bible alone as authoritative, because it
alone is inspired by God. </p>

<p class="style1">The sects also usually acknowledge the Bible as the inspired word of God. However, most
of them claim that other writings are also inspired. These writings become the final
doctrinal authority, since they are usually the grid through which the Bible is
interpreted. Some sects (&quot;Jehovah's Witnesses&quot; and &quot;The Way&quot;) believe
that the Bible alone is inspired, but claim to have the uniquely correct interpretation
and/or translation of the Bible. This interpretation becomes in practice the final
authority of the sect. </p>

<h5 class="style1">A. Acknowledgement by sects that the Bible is the inspired word of God:</h5>

<ol class="style1">
  <li>Mormonism: &quot;We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated
    correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.&quot; </li>
  <li>Christian Science: &quot;The Bible has been my only authority. I have had no other guide
    in &quot;the straight and narrow way&quot; of Truth. In following these leadings of
    scientific revelation, the Bible was my only textbook.&quot; </li>
  <li>Jehovah's Witnesses: &quot;The Holy Scripture of the Bible are the standard by which to
    judge all religions.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;To let God be found true means to let God have the say to what is the truth that
    sets men free... Our obligation is to back up what is said herein by quotations from the
    Bible for proof of truthfulness and reliability.&quot; </li>
  <li>The Way: &quot;There is no room for interpretation or discussion. &quot;We must come to
    The Word, let The Word speak, and then adjust our thinking according to the integrity and
    accuracy of The Word. After we have let The Word speak, we must accordingly harmonize our
    beliefs, our actions, and our living.&quot; </li>
  <li>The Unification Church: &quot;Until our mission with the Christian church is over, we
    must quote the Bible and use it to explain the Divine Principle. After we receive the
    inheritance of the Christian church we will be free to teach without the Bible.&quot; </li>
</ol>

<h5 class="style1">B. Sects claims that additional writings are inspired by God: </h5>

<ol class="style1">
  <li>Mormonism: &quot;And now, verily I say unto you, I was in the beginning with the Father,
    and am the First-born; <br>
    And all those who are begotten through me are partakers of the glory of the same, and are
    the church of the First-born.<br>
    Ye were also in the beginning with1 the Father...&quot; </li>
  <li>Christian Science: &quot;I should blush to write of Science and Health with Key to the
    Scriptures, as I have, were it of human origin, and were I apart from God, its author.
    But, as I was only a scribe echoing the harmonies of heaven in divine metaphysics, I
    cannot be super-modest in my estimate of the Christian Science textbook.&quot; <br>
    &quot;A Christian Scientist requires my work Science and Health for his textbook, and so
    do all his students and patients. Why? First: Because it is the voice of Truth to this
    age, and contains the full statement of Christian Sciences, or the Science of healing
    through Mind. Second: Because it was the first book known, containing a thorough statement
    of Christian Science. Hence it gave the first rules for demonstrating this Science, and
    registered the revealed Truth uncontaminated by human hypotheses.&quot; </li>
  <li>The Unification Church: &quot;It may be displeasing to religious believers, especially
    to Christians, to learn that a new expression of truth must appear. They believe that the
    Bible, which they now have, is perfect and absolute in itself.&quot;<br>
    &quot;...The New Testament Words of Jesus and the Holy Spirit will lose their light...to
    'lose their light' means that the period of their mission has elapsed with the coming of
    the new age.&quot; </li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3 class="style1">III. CHRISTOLOGY: THE PERSON OF CHRIST</h3>

<p class="style1">The Bible clearly asserts both the humanity and deity of Jesus Christ. The biblical
authors regard rejection or alteration of this doctrine as heresy (I Jn. 4:1-6; Col.
2:4,8,9), since it directly affects the meaning and value of His death on the cross. </p>

<p class="style1">The modern sects almost universally attack the deity of Christ. While some sects make
this denial outright, others are more ambiguous. But all have departed from the clear
biblical position. </p>

<h5 class="style1">A. Sects' claims that Jesus is not fully God:</h5>

<ol class="style1">
  <li>Mormonism: &quot;The divinity of Jesus is the truth which now requires to be
    received...the divinity of Jesus and [divinity] of all other noble and saintly souls,
    insofar as they, too, have been inflamed by a spark of deity---insofar as they, too, can
    be recognized as manifestations of the Divine.&quot; </li>
  <li>Christian Science: &quot;The spiritual Christ was infallible; Jesus, as material
    manhood, was not Christ.&quot; &quot;In healing the sick and sinning, Jesus elaborated the
    fact that the healing effect followed the understanding of the divine Principle and of the
    Christ-spirit which governed the corporeal Jesus.&quot; </li>
  <li>Jehovah's Witness: &quot;He was a spirit person, just as &quot;God is a Spirit&quot;; he
    was a mighty one, although not almighty as Jehovah God is; also he was before all others
    of God's creatures, for he was the first son that Jehovah God brought forth. Hence he is
    called &quot;the only begotten Son&quot; of God, for God has no partner in bringing forth
    his first-begotten Son.&quot; </li>
  <li>The Way: &quot;...The Gospel of John established the truth of God's Word that Jesus
    Christ was the Son of God, not &quot;God the Son&quot; or 'God Himself'.&quot; </li>
  <li>The Unification Church: &quot;Historically, Jesus the Messiah came in Adam's place to
    restore mankind. He was not Deity...it is a great error to think Jesus was God
    Himself.&quot; </li>
</ol>

<h5 class="style1">B. Sects' explanations of Jesus' &quot;actual&quot; identity: </h5>

<ol class="style1">
  <li>Mormonism: &quot;Jesus Christ is not the Father of the spirits who have taken or yet
    shall take bodies upon this earth, for He is one of them. He is The Son as they are sons
    or daughters of Elohim.&quot; </li>
  <li>Christian Science: &quot;Christ is the ideal Truth, that comes to heal sickness and sin
    through Christian Sciences, and attributes all power to God. Jesus is the name of the man
    who, more than all other men, has presented Christ, the true idea of God... Jesus is the
    human man, and Christ is the divine idea; hence the duality of Jesus the Christ.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    &quot;He is &quot;the spiritual or true idea of God&quot; &quot;Christ, as the true
    spiritual idea, is the ideal of God now and forever...&quot; </li>
  <li>Jehovah's Witness: &quot;...at Colossians 1:15 he is spoken of as 'the image of the
    invisible God, the firstborn of all creation'. Thus he is ranked with God's creation,
    being first among them and also most beloved and most favored among them. He is not the
    author of the creation of God; but, after God had created him as his firstborn Son, then
    God used him as his working Partner in the creating of all the rest of creation. It is so
    stated at Colossians 1:16-18 and at John 1:1-3, NW.&quot; </li>
  <li>The Way: &quot;Those who teach that Jesus Christ is God and God is Jesus Christ will
    never stand approved in 'rightly dividing' God's word, for there is only one God, and
    'thou shalt have no other gods'. The Bible clearly teaches that Jesus Christ was a man
    conceived by the Holy Spirit, God, whose life was without blemish and without spot, a lamb
    from the flock, thereby being the perfect sacrifice. Thus he became our redeemer.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;...we note that Jesus Christ is directly referred to as the &quot;Son of God&quot;
    in more than 50 verses in the New Testament; he is called &quot;God&quot; in four. (Never
    is he called &quot;God the Son&quot;) By sheer weight of this evidence alone, 50 to 4, the
    truth should be evident.&quot; </li>
  <li>The Unification Church: &quot;Jesus on earth 'was a man no different from us except for
    the fact that He was without original sin.'&quot; </li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3 class="style1">IV. SOTERIOLOGY: THE WORK OF CHRIST ON THE CROSS</h3>

<p class="style1">The Bible claims that man's acceptance with God is based entirely on Christ's work on
the cross, completely apart from man's works for God (Gal. 2:16,21; Rom. 3:19-26). Because
of this, man receives God's acceptance as a free gift by faith alone (Eph. 2:8,9). Though
saving faith is evidenced by works in the life of the believer (Jas. 2:16-24), they are
regarded as the fruit of salvation (Gal. 5:22,23), not as the basis for it. The biblical
authors pronounce the strongest judgment on any teachers who alter this message (Gal.
1:3-9). </p>

<p class="style1">The sects generally attack the full sufficiency of Christ's work on the cross and thus
make salvation dependent finally upon man's works for God. Usually, the claim is made that
both faith and works are necessary for salvation. </p>

<p class="style1">Some sects attack the work of Christ in a different way. &quot;Christian Science&quot;
has an entirely different idea of salvation. In the case of &quot;The Way&quot;, the
nature of saving faith is diluted to mere mental assent. </p>

<h5 class="style1">A. Sects' explanations of Christ's death on the cross:</h5>

<ol class="style1">
  <li>Mormonism: &quot;Joseph Smith taught that there were certain sins so grievous that man
    may commit, that they will place transgressors beyond the power of the atonement of
    Christ. If these offenses are committed, then the blood of Christ will not cleanse them
    from their sins even though they repent. Therefore their only hope is to have their own
    blood shed to atone, as far as possible, in their behalf.&quot; </li>
  <li>Christian Science: &quot;The real atonement - so infinitely beyond the heathen
    conception that God requires human blood to propitiate His justice and bring His mercy -
    needs to be understood. That God's wrath should be vented upon His beloved Son, is
    divinely unnatural . One sacrifice, however great, is insufficient to pay the debt of sin.
    The material blood of Jesus was no more efficacious to cleanse from sin when it was shed
    upon &quot;the accursed tree&quot;, than when it was flowing in his veins as he went daily
    about his Father's business.&quot; </li>
  <li>Jehovah's Witness: &quot;Thus John showed the secondary purpose for which the Son of God
    came to earth, namely, to die as a holy sacrifice to Jehovah God in order to cancel the
    sins of believing men and to free them from death's condemnation, that they might gain
    eternal life in the righteous new world which God has promised to create.&quot; </li>
  <li>The Way: &quot;Separating the Father from the Son does not at all discredit the
    Son...Rather, trinitarian dogma...degrades God from his elevated, unparalleled position;
    besides, it leaves man unredeemed.&quot; &quot;If Jesus Christ is God and not the Son of
    God, we have not yet been redeemed.&quot; </li>
  <li>The Unification Church: &quot;Jesus failed in His mission. He was crucified before He
    could marry. It was never God's predetermined purpose that He die.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It is equally true that the cross has been unable to establish the Kingdom of Heaven
    on Earth by removing our original sin&quot; </li>
</ol>

<h5 class="style1">B. Sects' statements on the conditions for salvation:</h5>

<ol class="style1">
  <li>Mormonism: &quot;We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be
    saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel. </li>
  <li>&quot;We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are first, Faith
    in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the
    remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. </li>
  <li>Christian Science: &quot;To get rid of sin through Science, is to divest sin of any
    supposed mind or reality, and never to admit that sin can have intelligence or power, pain
    or pleasure. You conquer error by denying its verity.&quot; </li>
  <li>Jehovah's Witness: &quot;All who by reason of faith in Jehovah God and in Christ Jesus
    dedicate themselves to do God's will and then faithfully carry out their dedication will
    be rewarded with everlasting life.&quot; </li>
  <li>The Way: &quot;...now that a person is going to change lordships when he confesses with
    his mouth a new Lord - Jesus Christ.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    &quot;...the only visible and audible proof that a man has been born again and filled with
    the gift from the Holy Spirit is always that he speak in a tongue or tongues.&quot; </li>
  <li>The Unification Church: &quot;At this point (namely, after Jesus' death on the cross),
    God could claim the souls of men, but could not give redemption to the body.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Jesus failed to redeem man physically. Therefore physical restoration is still to be
    accomplished by another Messiah at the Second Advent.&quot; </li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3 class="style1">V. ESCHATOLOGY: THE RETURN OF CHRIST AND THE FATE OF NONCHRISTIANS. </h3>

<p class="style1">The Bible teaches that Jesus Christ will return physically to rule the world (Acts
1:11). Those who reject God's provision for salvation will be held responsible for the
decision they made in this life (Heb. 9:27). They will be finally judged and condemned to
eternal separation from God. Several passages indicate that this state will be conscious
as well as everlasting (Matt. 25:46; II Thess. 1:9; Rev. 14:9-11). </p>

<p class="style1">Most of the sects deny this scriptural teaching. Some flatly teach that all people will
be saved. Some teach that all people will be given another chance to believe in Christ.
Others teach that unbelievers will be annihilated. </p>

<h5 class="style1">A. Sects' positions on the return of Christ:</h5>

<ol class="style1">
  <li>Christian Science: &quot;The second appearing of Jesus is, unquestionably, the spiritual
    advent of the advancing idea of God, as in Christian Science.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It is authentically said that one expositor of Daniel's dates fixed the year 1866 or
    1867 for the return of Christ - the return of the spiritual idea to the material earth or
    antipode of heaven. It is a marked coincidence that those dates were the first two years
    of my discovery of Christian Science.&quot; </li>
  <li>Jehovah's Witness: &quot;The meaning of 'parousia' is more exact than the word 'coming'
    contained in the general English versions. It does not mean he is on the way or has
    promised to come, but that he has already arrived and is here.&quot;<br>
    &quot;Jesus Christ returns, not again as a human, but as a glorious spirit person.&quot; </li>
  <li>The Unification Church: &quot;The Lord of the Second Advent is to be born on the earth
    as the King of Kings...We are not to expect the return of Jesus himself, but another
    Messiah - a man who will be born in Korea...He will be confirmed as the Messiah through
    the spirit world.&quot; </li>
</ol>

<h5 class="style1">B. Sects' positions on the fate of unbelievers:</h5>

<ol class="style1">
  <li>Mormonism: &quot;We need a little more explanation as to just what we mean by
    unconditional redemption. That means to restore us from this mortal state to the immortal
    state; in other words, to give unto us the resurrection. This comes to every creature, not
    only to men but also to the fish, the fowls of the air, and the beasts of the field... All
    of them had spiritual existence before they were placed upon the earth; therefore they are
    to be redeemed.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The Sons of Perdition, the human members of whom, according to one Mormon source,
    are &quot;but a small portion of the human race,&quot; will be permanently consigned to
    hell. There they are &quot;doomed to suffer the wrath of God, with the devil and his
    angels, in eternity&quot;; for their sin &quot;there is no forgiveness in this world nor
    in the world to come&quot;. Their torment will be endless, for &quot;their worm dieth not
    and the fire is not quenched, which is their torment - and the end thereof, neither the
    place thereof, nor their torment, no man knows&quot;. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;The Celestial Kingdom. This kingdom, which will be located on this earth after its
    renewal, 'is prepared for the righteous, those who have been faithful in keeping the
    commandments of the Lord, and have been cleansed of all their sins.'&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The Terrestrial Kingdom. This kingdom will be located on some sphere other than the
    earth, presumably another plant. Into this kingdom the following will go:<br>
    <br>
    Accountable persons who die without law...<br>
    <br>
    Those who reject the gospel in this life and who reverse their course and accept it in the
    spirit world;<br>
    <br>
    Honorable men of the earth who are blinded by the craftiness of men and who therefore do
    not accept and live the gospel law;<br>
    <br>
    Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints...who are not valiant, but who
    are instead lukewarm in their devotion to the Church and to righteousness.&quot; </li>
  <li>Christian Science: &quot;Man's probation after death is the necessity of his
    immortality; for good dies not and evil is self-destructive, therefore evil must be mortal
    and self-destroyed. If man should not progress after death, but should remain in error, he
    would be inevitably self-annihilated.&quot; </li>
  <li>Jehovah's Witness: &quot;The doctrine of a burning hell where the wicked are tortured
    eternally after death cannot be true, mainly for four reasons: (1) It is wholly
    unscriptural; (2) it is unreasonable; (3) it is contrary to God's love, and (4) it is
    repugnant to justice.&quot; </li>
  <li>The Unification Church: &quot;When he declares the Kingdom, the life spirits of those
    who have lived before will join the followers of Rev. Moon so that they can develop into
    divine spirits. Evil people will go through a similar reincarnation procedure. The law of
    Karma is operative in this procedure, for, '...if any arrive in the spirit world with
    unpaid debts, they will have to work to assist perhaps the very ones they hurt in order to
    pay what they owe.'&quot; </li>
</ol>

<h3 class="style1">VI. COMMUNICATION GUIDELINES</h3>

<p class="style1">It is not enough for the Christian to able to discern false doctrine and defend true
doctrine. It is also necessary to be able to discuss these issues in a way that helps the
other person to come to the truth. The following guidelines have been found to be
important considerations for the Christian discussing the sects. 
<ol class="style1">
  <li>Treat the other person with love and respect. One of the most common mistakes in dealing
    with sect-members is to regard them as the enemy to be defeated. It is imperative to
    remember that it is the thought system itself, not the adherent to it, that is to be
    defeated (II Cor. 10:3-5). The person involved in the sect is to be rescued from the false
    system (Jude 22,23). A sincere attitude of love and respect for the person is necessary
    for this to happen. Avoid heated argumentation and any form of abusive speech. </li>
  <li>Stay focused on essential doctrines. The focus should stay on the essential doctrines of
    scripture and how the teaching of the sect denies them. Avoid getting into many of the
    particulars of the sect. They may be interesting, but tend to move the focus of the
    discussion away from essential scriptural doctrine. Also avoid attacking the founder or
    history of the sect. This kind of argumentation is fallacious: the behavior of the
    followers can neither verify nor falsify the sect's doctrines. Christianity would fall
    prey to the same kind of attack, as any experienced sect member will be quick to point
    out! </li>
  <li>Be prepared to ask specific and repeated questions about the sect's stand on essential
    doctrines. Some sects school their people to avoid discussing concrete areas of doctrine.
    When this is the case, the Christian should insist that a clear answer be given to the
    doctrine in question. </li>
  <li>Be prepared to discuss hermeneutics. Sect members are usually aware of the biblical
    passages which contradict their doctrines as well as the ones which supposedly support
    them. Because of this fact, the discussion will often center around the interpretation of
    the given texts. The Christian should be able to defend his interpretation of texts which
    support essential doctrines, and refute the wrong interpretation of the texts used by the
    sect member. (For more on this subject, see the handout on &quot;Hermeneutical
    Principles&quot;.) </li>
  <li>Respond to people according their degree of openness. It is unwise to have the same
    immediate goals for all people involved in a sect. Several factors should be considered in
    forming a realistic goal for the discussion. </li>
</ol>

<ul class="style1">
  <li>Is the person a highly committed sect member, perhaps engaged in evangelism? The greater
    his commitment, the less probable that any significant change of mind will be seen in one
    discussion. It is usually best in this situation to give a clear and strong defense of the
    Christian position, coupled with an exposure of the key weak areas of the sect's doctrine.
    If no willingness to deal honestly with the passages brought up, it is best to politely
    end the discussion. </li>
  <li>If the person is a &quot;second-generation&quot; member, a greater degree of openness
    may be present. Stress the grace of God with this person. </li>
  <li>If the person is not a sect member, or if he/she is a new member, a high degree of
    openness is often present. The person is usually interested in spiritual things and the
    Bible, but has perhaps had exposure only to sect doctrine and/or Christian doctrine
    without proper defense. Stress the deity of Christ and the grace of God with this person,
    and show how the sect has misinterpreted passages to support its position. </li>
</ul>

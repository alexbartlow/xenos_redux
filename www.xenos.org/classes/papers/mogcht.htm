<h1 class="style1">The Means of Growth refer to the avenues through which God most commonly
conveys his grace to walking believers. But partaking of only one or two means of growth
will not result in a proportionate level of growth. The means of growth are a way of life.
They form a matrix of balanced living which is upset by the absence of even one. For
instance, suppose a believer was involved in regular fellowship, read his Bible and
ministered to others, but never, or only rarely prayed! This chart examines how the
dynamic relationship between different means of growth works. Read Walking In Victory for
the full commentary on the chart. </h1>

    <td width="15%" class="style1">Fellowship</td>
    <td width="84%" class="style1">Jesus gave corporate prayer a special place when he said, &quot;if two of
    you agree on earth about anything that they may ask, it shall be done for them by My
    Father who is in heaven.&quot; (Matthew&nbsp;18:19) Based on this promise, we may fairly
    conclude that Jesus is implying that corporate prayer is more powerful than individual
    prayer, if only because when two or more agree, they have a better chance of truly
    discerning the will of God. The prayer ministry of the church is one of the most
    important.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="15%" class="style1">Ministry</td>
    <td width="84%" class="style1">A ministry weak in prayer will tend to be overly strong on human effort.
    What we cannot accomplish via the power of God, we will try to supply through our own
    power. As we lose faith in the effectiveness of prayer, we will succumb to the temptation
    to use force and compulsion on people in an effort to bend them to our will.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="15%" class="style1">Scripture</td>
    <td width="84%" class="style1">We need to pray that God will take scriptural truth and apply it to our
    lives in a living way. If we have learned the Scriptures in good measure, God will find it
    easier to bring us understanding about what he is doing in our daily lives. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="15%" class="style1">Discipline of the Holy Spirit</td>
    <td width="84%" class="style1">Cultivating the vertical perspective through abiding in Christ is a
    prerequisite for much of the Lord's discipline to be effective. As we shall see later,
    those who will not take their trials to God in prayer--not just to ask that the trial go
    away, but asking to understand what he is teaching--will not benefit from the suffering
    they undergo.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="15%" class="style1">Prayer</td>
    <td width="84%" class="style1">In our prayer life, the Bible provides the proper basis for knowing God by
    telling us what he is like. According to Jesus, effective prayer is based on the Word
    (John&nbsp;l5:7). John promises that &quot;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.if we ask anything
    according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us in whatever we ask, we
    know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him.&quot; (I&nbsp;John&nbsp;5:14)
    This is a powerful promise, but it is conditional. We have to ask &quot;according to his
    will.&quot; But how do we know what the will of God is apart from Scripture?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="15%" class="style1">Ministry</td>
    <td width="84%" class="style1">Servanthood is a means of growth, but effective service involves
    &quot;speaking the truth in love.&quot; (Ephesians&nbsp;4:15) No ministry will have the
    power God wants it to have unless the one ministering is powerful in the Word of God. Even
    service ministers who may not teach or preach need the wisdom available in God's word. We
    will not be effective at ministry or in our personal growth if we can not fend off the
    attacks of Satan, and this is not possible unless we are able to cite our authority from
    the Scriptures.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="15%" class="style1">Body Life</td>
    <td width="84%" class="style1">The basis for Christian fellowship is not only love but truth. The Body of
    Christ is a community of truth, and these two can never be separated. In Philippians
    1:9,10 Paul prays, &quot;that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge
    and all discernment, so that you may approve the things that are excellent, in order to be
    sincere and blameless until the day of Christ&quot; Truth is the framework that makes real
    love possible. This is why we are called on to &quot;speak the truth in love&quot; to one
    another (Ephesians&nbsp;4:15)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="15%" class="style1">Discipline of the Holy Spirit</td>
    <td width="84%" class="style1">The discipline of the Holy Spirit is a means of growth, but it won't be
    effective unless we respond appropriately. We need Scripture like that in Hebrews 12 to
    teach us how to respond to discipline in a way that promotes growth, as we shall see. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="15%" class="style1">Prayer</td>
    <td width="84%" class="style1">The church is to be a praying community. By precept and example, prayer
    plays a central role in the life of the church. It is reasonable to think that others can
    stimulate us to love and good works (Hebrews&nbsp;10:24,25), including prayer. By
    establishing regular times to pray with others, we can strengthen our prayer habits, while
    gaining the discernment of the other members. Prayer is the spearhead of the church's
    ministry; opening doors, producing conviction in the hearts of those who hear, protecting
    those reached from Satan and granting spiritual empowerment to Christian workers.</td>
  </tr>

    <td width="15%" class="style1">Ministry</td>
    <td width="84%" class="style1">The church exists to accomplish ministry, both to its members and to the
    world outside the church. Ministry carried out off by myself is never as impactful as that
    accomplished with others. I need to learn to disciple (train) others so they can carry on
    the same kind of ministry. I may have to be discipled myself before I can be effective at
    ministry, and this is best accomplished in a healthy local church.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="15%" class="style1">Scripture</td>
    <td width="84%" class="style1">The church should teach the Word of God. The church is ordered to equip
    its members to do the work of service. (Ephesians&nbsp;4:11,12) Instruction in the Bible
    is central to this commission. The church should also use the Bible to ground new
    Christians and even for evangelism at its public meetings.</td>

    <td width="84%" class="style1">When we are undergoing difficult times of spiritual discipline from the
    Lord, Christian fellowship is sometimes the only thing that keeps us from falling apart.
    We were never meant to undergo significant breaking without the support of a loving
    community. At the same time I receive support, I have the opportunity to give support and
    to coach young Christians on how to understand God's hand in their lives during trials.</td>

    <td width="15%" class="style1">Scripture</td>
    <td width="84%" class="style1">When others are looking to us for guidance and help in their Christian
    walks there will be a new urgency in our study of Scripture. This is because, as discussed
    earlier, Scripture holds the key to successful ministry. Feeding young believers the Word
    of God is basic to most kinds of ministry. Even service oriented ministry should be
    carried out in light of the Bible and should include the use of Scripture.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="15%" class="style1">Fellowship</td>
    <td width="84%" class="style1">The experience of living in a church which has developed an other-centered
    perspective, and a strong ministry ethic is truly one of the most edifying and exciting
    experiences possible. It is also one of the most difficult to find. When we have a church
    which has adopted ministry for all as its ethic, it will equip us and facilitate our
    ministry through the use of the combined man-power and financial resources in the church.
    The church becomes the natural place to bring guests and know that others there will not
    ruin outreach or discipleship efforts, but enhance them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="15%" class="style1">Prayer</td>
    <td width="84%" class="style1">Those who are strong in ministry know how many times their ministries have
    spurred them on to intense periods of prayer. It is hard for such people to imagine what
    it would be like to feel the obligation to pray, but without the natural and healthy
    motivation created by ministry. As ministers, no longer are we merely praying because it's
    the right thing to do, or because we hope we can feel better as a result. Instead, there
    are real tasks to accomplish through prayer in the lives of others. Those who are
    established in defined and personal ministry consistently demonstrate more appreciation
    for prayer than those who are lacking this vital means of growth.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="15%" class="style1">Discipline of the Holy Spirit</td>
    <td width="84%" class="style1">We will see later that spiritual discipline is largely intended to make us
    more effective in ministry. At the same time being in ministry will cause us to experience
    maximum benefit from discipline. We regularly find that those who are tied into extensive
    ministry are prepared and able to endure the necessary suffering to be conformed to the
    image of Christ for the sake of those people who depend on their ministry. Those who are
    not active in ministry find it too easy to run in the face of painful discipline.</td>

      <p class="style1">The need for effective small group ministry is implied in the new testament. If the
        local church is to truly develop the spiritual gifts of its members, and mobilize the
        terrific power of the Holy Spirit to work through a trained and experienced laity, if it
        is to facilitate true relationship-based community, it will need to organize smaller
        groups where these can be fostered.</p>
      <p class="style1">Xenos Fellowship, an independent church in Columbus Ohio, has centered it's ministry in
    lay-led, small home group ministry since it's beginning in 1970. Using this focus, Xenos
    has grown from a handful in 1970 to well over 3000 today. Their small group ministry has
    also resulted in good morale on the part of the 400 lay home fellowship leaders, all
    graduates of the 2 year graded training course for leaders.</p>
    <p class="style1">Because of this success, other pastors often call on the Xenos staff to consult
    regarding how to establish and/or manage small group lay ministry in their own churches.</p>
    <p class="style1">Through these consultations, we have discovered that small group ministries are not a
    novel idea at all. In fact, most evangelical churches seem to have tried to establish a
    network of small groups at one time or another. At the same time, most of these efforts
    are disappointing to some degree-- Leaders often ask us, &quot;What have we been doing
    wrong?&quot;</p>
    <p class="style1">The problems encountered when trying to establish a home group ministry sometimes
    include a lack of participation and interest on the part of the members of the church.
    Sometimes a small minority of the church struggles along, unwilling to admit failure in
    the program, and developing a &quot;faithful remnant&quot; theology which justifies, on
    theological grounds, the lack of growth and lack of participation by the other members.
    Church division is also a possibility, although we have not seen very many cases where
    this occurred.</p>
    <p class="style1">We think these frequent failures are not the result of divine opposition to the idea of
    small groups, or the fact that, &quot;our kind of people aren't right for this sort of
    thing.&quot; Instead, we think there are a number of good theological and practical
    reasons why these groups usually fail.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="style1">1. They are often not based on New Testament theory</h3>
    <p class="style1">Both New Testament example and principle argue for small home-sized groups as a key
    feature of the local church. In the area of biblical example, Acts 2:46 states that the
    Jerusalem church met &quot;in the temple&quot; and &quot;from house to house . . .&quot;
    Concerning the meetings in the Temple, we know that Solomon's portico was probably quite
    large, and could have accommodated even the several thousands that were a part of the
    Jerusalem church. Thus, in Jerusalem, they held both large and small group meetings.</p>
    <p class="style1">Clearly, they did not feel the large meetings were enough by themselves. It should be
    obvious that an impersonal atmosphere will result if we only hold only very large
    meetings. The local church should encourage a network of close relationships in its
    congregation because real community must be based on close relationships. Smaller group
    meeting formats such as those described in this passage would be ideal for fostering such
    relationships.</p>
              <p class="style1">In another case, Paul reminded the Ephesian elders that he had exhorted 
                them both &quot;publicly and from house to house.&quot; (Acts 
                20:20) In this passage, &quot;publicly&quot; probably refers to 
                the school room of Tyrannus (Acts 19:9). But Paul did not limit 
                his speaking ministry to the large meeting place, even though 
                one was available. He also worked &#147;from house to house.&#148;</p>
              <p class="style1">Paul apparently refers to several home churches in the city of 
                Rome (Romans 16: 4, 10, 11, 14, 15,). In I Cor. 14:35 he mentions 
                &#147;churches&#148; in the plural, after having already referred 
                to &#147;the church of God which is at Corinth,&#148; (I Corinthians 
                1:2) in the singular.</p>
              <p class="style1">It seems clear from these and other references that operating 
                a cluster of home churches in each city was common practice. These 
                home groups continued to work together under the same elders. 
                It is probably significant that no church buildings have been 
                found from the earliest period of the church (33&#151;150 AD.), 
                and even those from the second century were homes with a large 
                room built in. Every church with a building faces the challenge 
                of resisting people's tendency to view the building as the church. 
                At Xenos, we have refused to build or to expand our building until 
                we see a high degree of involvement in home groups.&nbsp; Otherwise, 
                by expanding the building we would only worsen the problem of 
                superficial involvement in the local church. Currently, the elders 
                at Xenos set a goal of 80% involvement in home groups, and so 
                far, God has allowed us to maintain that rate of incorporation.</p>
    <p class="style1">New Testament principles surrounding the issues of body life, spiritual gifts, and the
    fact that real spiritual ministry is the business of every member in the local church can
    not be effectively brought into practice in a large group setting. (see Rom. 12; I Cor.
    12,14; Eph. 4:11-16; Col. 2:19) The church must provide smaller group settings where
    relationships can grow between members so they will be able to discover each other's
    needs. Only then will they be able to meet those needs on an individual level.</p>
              <p class="style1">Unfortunately, when churches attempt to initiate a small group ministry, 
                they sometimes fail to teach and persuate their people that the 
                purpose of the meeting is to practice these biblical principles. 
                The result is sometimes a wrong impression on the part of most 
                participants. Members often feel that the meeting is primarily 
                intended as a social gathering, a support group, or a place where 
                &#147;my needs can be met,&#148; rather than &#147;a place where 
                I can develop a ministry.&#148; </p>
    <p class="style1">The first order of business in beginning this kind of ministry is to launch a teaching
    offensive in the church. The goal would be to establish an understanding and a vision of
    the New Testament model and the spiritual goals associated with lay mobilization in the
    minds of the participants.</p>
    <h3 class="style1">2. The wrong criteria are sometimes followed for the selection of leaders</h3>
              <p class="style1">The Bible teaches that spiritual criteria must be used to select 
                leaders. The <a href="../servanthood1/deaconreq.htm">qualifications 
                of a deacon</a> (I Tim. 3:8-13) would serve well for the initial 
                selection of leaders of home fellowship groups. Too often, however, 
                the church will designate men and women for leadership on the 
                basis of secular abilities, job status, levels of financial giving, 
                or seniority in the church. The result is usually a meeting that 
                is not very spiritually edifying or appealing.</p>
              <p class="style1">After leaders have been selected on the basis of character and knowledge, 
                they should also be evaluated on the basis of actual function, 
                or role. When Jesus says &#147;my sheep hear my voice,&#148; he 
                is giving us a basic way to recognize a good shepherd. A Christian's 
                leadership cannot be authenticated until someone is willing to 
                follow him/her.</p>
              <p class="style1">In many of our churches, it may be very difficult to determine who our 
                authentic leaders are. This is because they have not had ample 
                opportunity to try their hand at leadership. In these cases, we 
                will have to pick leaders on the basis of the best criteria possible. 
                Later, when lay-led groups are in place, it should be possible 
                to evaluate the effectiveness of the work done by the more committed 
                members of the group. Other things being equal, the more effective 
                workers should be the first to be moved forward.</p>
    <h3 class="style1">3. Frequently, insufficient authority is given to the leaders</h3>
              <p class="style1">If the home fellowship is to be fashioned after the Biblical 
                examples of house churches, then the leaders of the groups should 
                be allowed to run their groups the way the leaders of the New 
                Testament house churches ran theirs. Since the New Testament instructs 
                readers to respect their leaders and to follow their lead in the 
                running of the home church, we can assume those leaders had many 
                decisions delegated to them. (I Corinthians 16:16; Hebrews 13:17; 
                I Thessalonians 5:14)</p>
    <p class="style1">Sometimes, churches impose a structure upon the small group that is too restrictive.
    This structure may include a pre-planned curriculum for study, and a long list of policy
    restrictions. The effect is usually to stifle initiative and sap motivation. The leaders
    realize very quickly that they are functioning as agents for the existing leadership of
    the church, but that they themselves are leaders in name only. When the church requires
    the home group leaders to check in on virtually all decisions, it clearly suggests that
    they are incompetent to make their own decisions. Sometimes they are incompetent, but the
    church must see the challenge in this, rather than accepting the status quo.</p>
    <p class="style1">Similarlly, pre-planned curriculum often actually scripts the meeting and requires
    little creativity or expertise on the part of group leaders. Indeed, the main reason for
    scripting the meeting is usually the feeling that group leaders have no expertise of their
    own. Such lack of expertise points in turn to a weak equipping ministry in the church.
    Failure to train leaders to a sophisticated level results in leaders who must be led by
    the hand at all times.&nbsp; When this happens, leaders (often highly competent and
    educated at their secular jobs) realize that anyone could follow the simple script, and
    consequently, they are not challenged. They lose interest in leading, and begin to call on
    the leadership to be passed around the group. They fail to take possession of the role of
    home group leader as a worth while life goal. We believe churches are often too impatient
    when trying to move from a program-based model to a home group model of church life, and
    therefore they grossly underestimate the level of training and equipping needed to develop
    effective leaders. Impatience may also signal lack of commitment, because in-depth
    equipping is expensive in both dollars and man hours for the church's leaders. See #7
    below.</p>
    <p class="style1">We don't believe the central leadership of the church should forsake all control over
    the actions of home fellowship leaders, because lay leaders are usually not as well
    trained as seminary graduates, or as experienced as the church's top leadership.
    Therefore, it is necessary to carefully weigh which areas are left to the discretion of
    the home leaders, and which areas need to be cleared with the higher authority of the
    church. The point in making this decision is to arrive at a balance that will prevent
    serious errors from occurring (even though we never have a guarantee that all problems can
    be prevented), while delegating real decision-making authority to the home fellowship
    leaders.</p>
    <h3 class="style1">4. The groups may have an unhealthy inward-focus</h3>
    <p class="style1">Small groups are often set up with the ultimate goal of fellowship or personal support
    rather than <a href="../um2-1.htm">evangelism or mission</a>. While quality fellowship and
    support is one of the rewards of small group ministry, it is an inadequate basis. If we
    have only fellowship as our goal, the group is corporately self-centered, or self-focused.
    Thus, it's no surprise that such groups are prone to division and discontent. This is
    because outreach and mission are the natural context within which fellowship should occur.</p>
    <p class="style1">When a group of people occupy themselves with each other to the exclusion of the
    outside world, discontent is sure to follow. We should be unwilling to consider the option
    of handling outreach at the large meeting and limiting small groups to a fellowship role.
    The group may not engage in outreach at its weekly meeting, but they have to work together
    and pray together on some shared mission.</p>
              <p class="style1">Acts 2:46 says that the Jerusalem church was &quot;breaking bread 
                from house to house&quot; but does not mention evangelism. However, 
                this is a moot point, since the passage does not mention where 
                evangelism did occur. On the other hand, in I Corinthians 14:24, 
                Paul clearly contemplates &quot;unbelievers&quot; entering a meeting 
                which is an interactive meeting-- apparently a home church (see 
                vs. 26,34).</p>
    <h3 class="style1">5. There is often no provision for church discipline within the small group</h3>
    <p class="style1">In cases where home fellowships are set up with no provision for church discipline, a
    very distressing and familiar pattern emerges. Some people are attracted to small groups
    for the wrong reasons. There are those who come to exploit others, or simply to use the
    group to become the center of attention.</p>
    <p class="style1">The impact of such people is greater in a small group than it would be in a large
    meeting. As a result, the whole character of the group can be altered to such an extent
    that it becomes difficult to attract new people, or even to hold the interest and loyalty
    of the productive members.</p>
              <p class="style1">The New Testament provides a solution to this kind of situation. 
                Those members who are willing to damage others or themselves are 
                to be confronted in love about their attitude and/or actions (see 
                I Thessalonians 5:14; Matthew 18:15). If they are not responsive, 
                a legitimate amount of pressure can be applied&#151;even to the 
                point of removing them from the group.</p>
              <p class="style1">According to the Bible, this kind of discipline in love should 
                be normative <a href="discip.htm">(I Corinthians 5)</a>. The application 
                of discipline should be gracious and suited to the needs of the 
                individual as well as the group. In order to prevent abuses or 
                legalism, the eldership should be consulted in cases where an 
                ultimatum may be issued.</p>
    <p class="style1">Churches worry about angering people if they practice discipline. This concern is
    legitimate. But while we will anger some by exercising discipline, we endanger all by
    failing to exercise it. Worst of all, those being disciplined miss out on one of the
    important provisions for growth in the New Testament.</p>
    <p class="style1">Small group attendance is a privilege in the church. Participation should have
    conditions attached, such as no anti-social or disruptive behavior. Otherwise, the small
    groups become soft, unruly, and unappealing.</p>
    <h3 class="style1">6. All groups may be the same, rather than diversified and matched to their members</h3>
    <p class="style1">For some reason, churches generally devise and execute a plan for small groups that
    features only one kind of group. We did this too. But not any more! Now we see that family
    aged people need a different type of group than students or singles, etc.</p>
              <p class="style1">Why should a large church (or even a small one) have only one type of group? 
                Creativity on the part of leaders and planners could result in                a number of models for meetings, featuring 
                different sizes, different formats, different purposes, and different 
                commitment levels. Every church should be different.</p>
    <h3 class="style1">7. There may be no adequate equipping offered to would-be leaders</h3>
              <p class="style1">The Bible does not allow the local church the option of telling 
                its people to go away for their training. According to Ephesians 
                4:11,12, it is the responsibility of the leadership of the local 
                church to provide <a href="../../admin/equip.htm">quality 
                training in Christian work</a> (&quot;the work of service&quot;) 
                to its own people. When the leadership of a church decides not 
                to have a small group ministry because its &quot;laymen&quot; 
                are too ignorant, this is not an excuse - it is an admission of 
                guilt!</p>
              <p class="style1">For many churches, the first step toward a successful home fellowship 
                ministry would be to establish a full <a href="../principles/index.htm">year-long 
                course</a> of in-depth theological and practical ministry training 
                for the proposed leadership group. We find that most churches 
                try to get by with a five or ten week training series which is 
                inadequate for sophisticated leadership responsibilities. People 
                will take longer training courses if they can break up the training 
                into modules, and if they view taking these classes as fun. This 
                is why we need to put our best communicators and leaders in as 
                teachers in this training.</p>
    <p class="style1">If a church already has an adequate supply of leaders who have some biblical knowledge,
    it would be preferable to hold this training while small groups are in progress, so they
    can immediately use the knowledge they learn. This prevents the accumulation of &quot;dead
    knowledge&quot; and also avoids creating the impression that Christian work is more
    difficult than it really is.</p>
    <p class="style1">At the same time, we should be clear that completing the training course will not
    necessarily result in an assignment as a home group leader. That decision will have to
    also depend on other considerations such as character development, and a record of
    self-sacrificing service to others.</p>
              <p class="style1">Finally, aside from classroom training, each home group should 
                develop it's own program of personal discipleship and ministry 
                training (Matthew 28:18-19, I Timothy 2:2).&nbsp;The classes should 
                be viewed as supplemental to the grass-roots discipleship practiced 
                at the home group level. </p>
    <h3 class="style1">8. The church may set no multiplication goals, and may have no good plan for
    multiplying home groups</h3>
    <p class="style1">In many cases, a home fellowship's existence is viewed as an end in itself. As
    mentioned earlier, this lack of mission-mindedness has a negative effect on the group. In
    order for groups to be spiritually healthy, they need a purpose greater than themselves.
    On the other hand, good small groups tend not to stay small. Thus, when a house fills up
    with people, much of the interactive character of the group is lost. In addition, outreach
    tends to dwindle because there is no room for new people.</p>
    <p class="style1">In cases like this, it is natural to divide the group in order to preserve the small
    size of the group, while at the same time, reaching more people.</p>
    <p class="style1">Unless the church propagates a vision and a plan for planting new groups which
    encourages outreach, discipleship, and equipping, home fellowships tend to resist
    multiplication. The status quo is always more comfortable than the change and risk that
    come with growth.</p>
    <p class="style1">We should establish ground rules that help to insure success for both newly planted
    groups, with a minimum of disruption to the relationships that have been developed.
    Otherwise, the system will tend to stifle initiative and punish success. In other words,
    the view of the leaders might well be, &quot;the faster our group grows, the sooner we get
    to part ways with the close friends we have made so far.&quot;</p>
    <p class="style1">Good planning should make it possible for close friends to stay together most of the
    time, thus minimizing the disruption involved in planting new groups.</p>
    <h3 class="style1">9. Small groups are sometimes viewed as peripheral rather than central to the life of
    the church</h3>
    <p class="style1">In some churches, the large worship meeting and/or teaching meetings are viewed as
    essential, but the home group is considered an option--helpful to some, but not
    necessarily normative for healthy involvement in the local church.</p>
              <p class="style1">As pointed out earlier, this view ignores the Biblical point 
                of view that the local body depends on the individual function 
                of <i>each</i> and <i>every</i> member (Ephesians 4:15,16). We 
                need to resist the temptation to dilute this teaching (for instance, 
                teaching that giving money on Sunday, or serving as an usher could 
                fulfill the intent of this passage). If we allow this kind of 
                superficial understanding of church life predominate, there will 
                be no strong motivation to exercise real spiritual gifts, or to 
                make small group ministry succeed.</p>
    <p class="style1">If the church fails to establish a vision in the minds of its members for full
    involvement, the result will likely be a very poor level of participation in the home
    fellowship program. Often, only those with little to do will spend the time it takes to
    become meaningfully involved. To obtain the help of our most gifted members, we will need
    to teach that involvement in home mission and fellowship is an exciting opportunity to
    finally realize the full extent of normal Christian experience.</p>
    <p class="style1">The leadership in the local church must cultivate a mentality, or consensus in the
    church which places an appropriate emphasis on this kind of ministry. Such a consensus can
    be created without resorting to legalism. The leadership must truly <i>believe</i> in the
    concept themselves, and be willing to teach and practice it in their own lives.</p>
    <h3 class="style1">10. They are sometimes viewed as a threat by the pastor(s) of the church.</h3>
    <p class="style1">Pastors might fear home groups for several reasons. False teaching is always a danger,
    but this is why the Bible teaches the need for &quot;overseers&quot; or elders. The elders
    should also train the &quot;lay&quot; work force so that they will be able to teach sound
    doctrine. Pastors also worry that a small group network may not be effective, thus leading
    to disappointment in the church. The record of home fellowships in recent years has been
    mixed, and somewhat disappointing. But we can see from this list some reasons why.</p>
    <p class="style1">Some leaders may prefer the control that they have when they are the only leaders in
    the church. This feeling is understandable, especially when a pastor is already having
    trouble controlling the situation in the church. However, we need to see at this point,
    that a quality small group ministry would not increase the work load of the pastor in the
    long run. The key to maintaining quality ministry even for a growing church, is to
    delegate work to other members. Pastors who succeed in establishing a successful and vital
    small group network do not see their own leadership eroded at all.</p>
    <p class="style1">The man or woman of God must pass judgment on his/her own attitude, admitting that a
    willingness to inhibit others' ministry for the sake of establishing his/her own is most
    censurable. The fact that we may feel threatened in our position in the church is no
    excuse! We have been placed where we are in order to facilitate others' ministry, not to
    inhibit it.</p>
    <h3 class="style1">11. Home groups are often introduced in a programmatic, not a natural way.</h3>
    <p class="style1">One church after another has reported that they formed a plan, presented it to the
    church, started a dozen home groups and got dismal results or even strong resistance from
    the congregation.&nbsp; We suggest not approaching home groups this way, because it is
    unnatural. Home groups should grow in an organic way, not be thrown into existence through
    a massive program. Instead, the best way to introduce home groups in our opinion is: <ul class="style1">
      <li>Identify a handful of people who understand and hunger for the vision of home-based
        fellowship. This could take some time, as leaders may have to persuade some that this
        approach is biblical and exciting.</li>
      <li>Once that group is identified, the leaders of the church should begin meeting with them
        in the first home group. Usually, a single home group is preferable, as the future opinion
        leaders in the church need to get on the same page about what a home group is and how it
        works.&nbsp; Plead with the senior pastor to be a part of this group. Planning meetings
        are not the answer here. Only meeting together and trying different formats and approaches
        will lead to the consensus you need. Group members should be encouraged to share with
        non-members their experiences and vision for these kind of groups. If the group is full
        and others are unable to join, their frustration will actually serve as motivation later
        when more groups are available. Calling on people to wait will not hurt the project,
        especially if you make it clear that they are welcome and you are eager to work them in as
        soon as possible. Keep a waiting list.</li>
      <li>During this first year, the leaders should devise and implement a series of courses for
        future home group leaders. People waiting to joing a home group should be urged to take
        advantage of the classes while they wait. If you have a lengthy waiting list, explain that
        those who take classes will be the first to qualify for participation in home groups.
        During this period, the church should come to realize that participation in home groups is
        not a duty or an added burden, but a priveledge.</li>
      <li>When the first group is full and people are ready (this could take months or a year or
        two) the group should divide and plant another group or groups. Then others can be again
        invited to join. </li>
      <li>We believe the natural pattern for adding members to existing groups is personal
        relationships, not geography. Churches that base home groups on geography usually find
        that the groups lack cohesion because people don't know each other. Allow people to invite
        their friends and relatives to their own group, regardless of where they live in the city.</li>
      <li>At first, the leadership may want to supervise additions to home groups. Later this will
        be unnecessary. The point is to try to assure success by getting the best people into home
        groups in a mix that promises success.&nbsp; Avoid filling groups with only hard cases.</li>
      <li>Using a system of collegiate review, allow and encourage groups to plant other groups
        when they are ready. Group leaders should participate in some type of oversight system.
        Avoid pressuring groups to move too fast, but also refuse to accept a mentality that says
        &quot;We're satisfied staying the way we are.&quot;</li>
      <li>Through multiplication of home groups you can see large numbers of groups formed within
        a few years. The larger congregation will naturally want to participate in something they
        hear others are enjoying. Have members of successful groups share their testimonies at
        your worship service and elsewhere. Build excitement gradually for the home group project.
        Give people a sense that they have arrived once they get to join a home group.</li>
    </ul>

      also requires very small numbers of learners for maximum effectiveness. 
      The subjective elements the model seeks to convey (like her urgency for 
      the things of God) are only apparent to those who are personally close enough 
      to appreciate what words and actions mean in the context of the model&#146;s

      be learning nothing at all. Yet, when well done, lecture is one of the most 
      persuasive forms of communication. A good lecture can arrest the attention

<p><font size="+2">We will be referring often in this class to <i>Mastering the 
  Techniques of Teaching</i> (Second Edition), Joseph Lowman (San Francisco, Josey-Bass 
  Inc., Publishers, 1995) Lowman is a recognized authority on college-age instruction. 
  All page numbers at ends of citations are from this excellent book.</font></p>
<b>
<h2> <font color="#CCFF33" size="+2">Definition </font></h2>
</b> 
<p><font size="+2">For our purposes, discussion will refer to leader-guided or 
  moderated group discussion. This will usually follow a pattern where the leader 
  teaches partly by lecture, or at least offers an introduction and conclusion. 
  Guided discussion may involve some peer-to-peer interaction, but most of the 
  interaction will be from learners to the leader or the group in general. The 
  leader offers a short summary and comment to most, or all, sharing.</font></p>
<h2><font color="#CCFF33" size="+2">Technique</font></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h3><font size="+2">Introduction:</font></h3>
<p><font size="+2">Some discussions seem to drag in fits and awkward silences, 
  creating tension in the group that further inhibits discussion. Other discussions 
  seem to thrive in eager sharing, with people actually competing to get their 
  point in. Why is this?</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">The most likely reason for such difference is the introduction. 
  In our introduction, we touch on the skills of public speaking, or homiletics. 
  The leader must stimulate and excite the group about the subject under consideration. 
  During this first part ot the meeting, the burden is completely on the leader 
  to:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+2">Raise the group's consciousness of the issues: Defining 
      what the issues are, and why they are urgent</font></p>
    <p><font size="+2">Emotionally engage the group with the subject and with 
      the leader</font></p>
    <p><font size="+2">Achieve arousal: People sit up, furrow their brows, smile, 
      laugh, and in other ways show that they have been impacted emotionally, 
      whether excited, disturbed, insulted (be careful with this one), or inspired.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+2">When people come into a meeting, they are not ready to discuss 
  anything. Most people come to meetings with cold hearts and empty minds. They 
  do not have any thoughts to share, or any desire to speak. Leaders who try to 
  start out with a discussion question are mistaken.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">Achieving such arousal is not necessarily a long project. It 
  could be accomplished in a couple of minutes, although you could spend up to 
  15 or even 20 minutes, if the you feel the need to lay a more complete groundwork. 
  These judgments are based on the subject matter and the audience. Longer introductions 
  have the potential to lay out more elaborate content, but may exhaust the audience 
  attention-span.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">To become adept at this part, consider taking a <a href="../homiletics/index.htm">class 
  in homiletics</a>.</font></p>
<h3><font size="+2">Probes</font></h3>
<p><font size="+2">The instructor will normally introduce &quot;probes&quot; or 
  questions intended to prod members toward a particular line of thought. However, 
  discussion is not recitation. Recitation is when the instructor gives students 
  an opportunity to clarify content or the instructor asks questions requiring 
  specific knowledge of study content, frequently from assigned readings (like 
  the teacher in &quot;The Paper Chase&quot;). We are not suggesting such recitation 
  is wrong or harmful, only that such is not what we are studying in this class.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">What then, are these questions, or probes, that elicit discussion? 
  Several patterns are successful. Here is a partial list:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+2">Set up an apparent contradiction in your introduction, 
      and ask the group how it might be resolved </font></p>
    <p><font size="+2">Ask them how a particular truth might apply either to life 
      in general, or to specific situations you imagine </font></p>
    <p><font size="+2"> Give them a statement from a third party (either imaginary 
      or an authority) and ask them to react to it </font></p>
    <p><font size="+2">Ask how someone from x, y, or z perspective would answer 
      a particular question </font></p>
    <p><font size="+2"> Ask what whether what you just distilled from a text or 
      narrative is different or the same as something else with which they are 
      already familiar (e.g. Is this teaching about letting each person have their 
      own conviction from Rom. 14 different in any way from relativism?) </font></p>
    <p><font size="+2"> Devil&#146;s advocacy: challenge a position they all seem 
      to accept axiomatically with some problems </font></p>
    <p><font size="+2"> Discovery: What do you think is this passage really saying? 
      </font></p>
    <p><font size="+2"> Personal experience: Who wants to share an experience 
      where this truth has made a difference? </font></p>
    <p><font size="+2">Comparing and contrasting: Lowman says, &quot;Asking students 
      to compare and contrast concepts, theories, and individuals orally in class 
      helps to clarify the relationships within a content area. 172 </font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+2">As learners answer each question, the leader responds with 
  a short summary statement and a further probe, until moving on to another subject.</font></p>
<h2><font color="#CCFF33" size="+2">Objectives</font></h2>
<p><font size="+2">After learning the particulars in a field of knowledge (such 
  as vocabulary and grammar rules in a language), the next stage in learning is 
  to progressively differentiate and relate the new particulars to existing particulars. 
  Discussion is particularly suitable for these later stages in learning. [see 
  exercise on Ausubel&#146;s stages of learning]</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">Consider Lowman&#146;s 5 types of thinking best developed in 
  discussion: Personal identification: What would Paul have felt during his imprisonment 
  in Rome? </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+2"><u><b>Objective or critical thinking</b></u>: What are 
      some problems with the notion of having no consciousness of sin in Heb. 
      10? Or, How would a Calvinist answer this?</font></p>
    <p><font size="+2"><u><b>Diagnostic thinking</b></u>: Ask students to draw 
      conclusions from a data set </font></p>
    <p><font size="+2"><u><b>Independent thinking</b></u>: Why did they reach 
      the conclusion they did? </font></p>
    <p><font size="+2"><u><b>As-if thinking</b></u>: Challenge them to predict 
      a future outcome based on data </font></p>
    <p><font size="+2"><u><b>Problem solving</b></u>: Asking them to propose solutions 
      to the problems under study </font></p>
    <p><font size="+2"><u><b>Increasing awareness of value controversies</b></u>: 
      &quot;These both sound good, let&#146;s hear more evidence for each </font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+2">Finally, consider these qualifications on leaders&#146; questions 
  by Lowman:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+2">Avoid questions that can be answered by short factual statements 
    or yes or no responses. Keep queries short and simple. If students must work 
    to decipher your questions, they are less likely to respond to it. Discussion 
    questions should be easily understandable by students, put forth decisively, 
    and followed by silence. [Lowman 180] </font></p>
  <p><font size="+2">The underlying assumption is that as people struggle with 
    concepts and their own thoughts and feelings, they will become very receptive 
    to new information and ideas that help them resolve the questions before them. 
    Research shows that when learners struggle for answers in a area they retain 
    those answers longer and more accurately. Further, when learners discuss related 
    issues under skillful guidance, they link the ideas in an associational network. 
    Such networks are remembered far longer than isolated concepts. 162</font></p>
  <p><font size="+2">More importantly, such discussion has the potential to develop 
    actual thinking skills that will never result from lecture. While an audience 
    might admire and enjoy a lecturer&#146;s thinking, we have no reason to believe 
    they would be able to imitate such thinking on their own in situations not 
    mentioned in a lecture. As Lowman observes, &quot;asking learners to apply 
    in your group what they have learned [through discussion] requires them to 
    demonstrate <i>understanding</i>, not merely <i>memorization</i>.&quot; 162 
    This is what we want from our people&#151;not just the ability to do what 
    a tape-recorder can do (spit back knowledge) but to creatively handle that 
    knowledge in ways that are useful in ministry and Christian living.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+2">Seen this way, we realize discussion is an essential type of 
  instruction where learners get to try their own wings like baby birds. I believe 
  a guided discussion format is <i>the best</i> approach for many Xenos cell groups, 
  small groups, and home churches. Authorities agree that even in large groups 
  of over 100 a skillful lecturer can incorporate periods of interaction with 
  good effect.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">However, guidance is essential. Many discussions lead nowhere, 
  and any conclusions reached are not memorable. As Lowman says, &quot;Discussion 
  should be for an intended purpose, not simply to hear students&#146; voices.&quot; 
  The notion that any discussion or interaction will naturally lead to advancement 
  in learners&#146; lives is naïve.</font></p>

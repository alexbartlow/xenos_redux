<h2><font size="+1"><strong>Responding during discussion continued:</strong></font></h2>
<ol>
  <ol start="8">
    <li><font size="+1">When someone shares a good point, we need a collection 
      of possible responses. A leader who simply says &quot;that&#146;s a good 
      point&quot; is not necessarily advancing the discussion. Try to assess how 
      to acknowledge and appreciate the point, summarize the point, while at the 
      same time deciding whether to doing one of the following (this takes fast 
      thinking on your feet): </font></li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">Ask for a further distinction or relationship between 
        the point just shared and something else said earlier: &quot;Is what you&#146;re 
        saying the same as what Pam said or different?&quot; &quot;How would you 
        distinguish between this and what the faith-healers teach?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Refine or clarify the point: &quot;I don&#146;t think 
        you&#146;re saying this are you?&quot; &quot;So do you think this &#145;turning 
        the cheek&#146; also applies to governments?&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Ask for exceptions to the point: &quot;Are there any 
        cases you can think of where this wouldn&#146;t apply?&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Ask for further implications of the point: &quot;I think 
        this might apply in some other areas too. Can anyone think of examples?&quot; 
        Ask for qualifications to the point: &quot;This is a good point, but can 
        anyone think of a qualification we should add?&quot; </font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ol>
  <ol start="9">
    <li><font size="+1">The typical pattern for group lessons is a series of points 
      made by the leader, interspersed with periods of discussion. Breaking out 
      of discussion and back into lecture is usually very natural after fielding 
      a comment:</font></li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">&quot;Thanks! That was very well-said. Now I&#146;d like 
        us to look at verse 5 for a minute.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Good, that really puts a point on it. Now let&#146;s 
        look at a related point.&quot; </font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <ol start="10">
    <li><font size="+1">If they have skipped points, say, &quot;Let&#146;s finish 
      up on that point before we go on.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot; Or &quot;I still didn&#146;t 
      hear how we are supposed to understand sowing and reaping in light of grace&quot;</font></li>
    <li><font size="+1">Don&#146;t assume new, unexpected directions are bad. 
      Ask yourself whether they have potential and whether you have time. If the 
      group is excited about the new direction, you may want to go with it.</font></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<b> 
<p><font size="+1">Ending Discussion</font></p>
</b> 
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li><font size="+1">Don&#146;t wait until everyone is worn out and refusing 
      to talk. Keep your eye on the clock and end on time. Time passes faster 
      during discussion than under other formats.</font></li>
    <li><font size="+1">If people are still discussing excitedly, you may delay 
      a bit, but warn them that &quot;we need to wrap it up soon.&quot;</font></li>
    <li><font size="+1">Ask &quot;Are there are any final thoughts before we tie 
      this all together?&quot; Then, give a short summary and final thought or 
      challenge before moving to prayer. </font></li>
    <li><font size="+1">Be sure to use some energy for this part. </font> 
      <p><font size="+1">You may want to refer to a point or two _______________ 
        earlier, naming them</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Consider thanking your group for their participation 
        (but this could also be done one-on-one afterward)</font></p>

    <li><font size="+1">When teachers give a summary of discussion, research shows 
      it will appear in students&#146; notes and will be remembered.</font></li>

</ol>
<h2><font size="+1"><b><font color="#CCFF33">Infusing energy into discussion</font> 
  </b></font></h2>
<ol>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">What makes a discussion exciting and energetic? </font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">1. Content</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font size="+1">- &quot;Content per minute&quot; has to be properly 
            paced. Too little content per minute makes people feel like they are 
            being patronized, as obvious points are repeated or belabored in an 
            unenlightening way. Too much content per minute leads to confusion. 
            We believe too much content is better than too little. We would rather 
            have people challenged than bored.</font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">- Content that is provocative, either of previous 
            assumptions, or of listeners' lifestyles, tends to be stimulating. 
            But use tact and care, because while insulting people may be interesting 
            and create feelings, we will not usually win the day this way.</font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">- Content that is new and unknown to listeners may 
            cause excitement, but only if we can show them why they would benefit 
            from learning something new, or why it is simply interesting. Also, 
            new content must be backed up with convincing evidence, because people 
            are more suspicious of new content.</font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">- Some content is simply not that interesting. Ask 
            yourself, &quot;Would I be interested in this subject if I wasn't 
            teaching?&quot; If not, you have to be creative enough to make it 
            interesting, or edit it out. Some truths are uninteresting because 
            they don't seem to apply or tie in with other knowledge. We have tried 
            to show you how to use thesis-antithesis thinking to make otherwise 
            dry content interesting. Likewise, strong illustrations, personal 
            sharing, and applying as you go can all make content interesting.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="+1"><br>
        2. Leader pathos -- Study the <a href="../homiletics/effectpreach.htm">outline 
        on authoritative speaking</a> In addition:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font size="+1">- Pathos is feeling. The truth is important and should 
            be served up with some feeling--otherwise we are sending mixed signals. 
            &quot;This is the most important truth in the world, but it doesn't 
            move me to raise my voice.&quot; </font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">- To create feeling, the speaker should actually 
            feel. When we let ourselves feel the urgency of our message, we are 
            said to have a &quot;burden&quot; for the material. We develop a burden 
            through prayer and wrestling with accusation and apathy during the 
            days before we teach. This is a good reason to avoid waiting until 
            the day before to prepare. Sometimes, our burden has to be taken on 
            faith, in the sense that we won't actually feel the zeal until we 
            actually step up to speak.</font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">- Leader inhibition causes us to want to be &quot;cool&quot; 
            when teaching, and not risk being viewed as foolish. While extreme 
            or corny displays would be considered foolish, most of us are in NO 
            DANGER of suffering this fate! Video taping your teaching will confirm 
            that most of us are much more reserved and inhibited than we think.</font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">- Consider the components of strong emotional communication:</font></p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font size="+1">1. <b>Voice</b> - emotion is noticeable in the 
              way we speak. An even, calm tone suggests a lack of emotion. Strong 
              emotional speech is variable -- The tone of our voice should rise 
              and fall in volume and in pitch. Also, emotional speech is generally 
              louder (unless expressing grief or similar). Try going extreme in 
              pitch and volume once in awhile on key points. Learn to throw the 
              hardball, but save it for key points. Also, unusual ways of bending 
              words, speaking with staccato gaps, repetition of phrases, and exaggerated, 
              slow or fast speech all attract waning attention and arouse curiosity. 
              Again, the important thing is not to throw all hardballs, but to 
              vary our approach. Intense fury is most impacting when juxtaposed 
              with happiness, humor, appeals, or sorrow. Throwing any pitch too 
              often becomes either boring, or even annoying.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">2. <b>Face</b> - Research confirms that much of 
              what we communicate emotionally is transmitted through the face. 
              When teaching, especially a home church or cell, you are easily 
              close enough to people for them to get a good look at your face. 
              Think about people who are emotional. How does their emotional state 
              affect their faces? Faces that are screwed up in agony, faces with 
              huge, happy smiles, faces that are solicitous or sympathetic, faces 
              that are disturbed or suspicious, all help to convey strong pathos. 
              A deadpan face suggest lack of interest and perfunctory discussion, 
              unmoved by the subject. What a terrible mistake to communicate God's 
              word that way!</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">3. <b>Body language</b> - When people are emotional, 
              you can tell from their body language. Unemotional people are stationary, 
              calm, and relaxed. Emotional people become agitated and their body 
              movements become pronounced. The head may begin to bob or jerk with 
              our speech, punctuating phrases. The head may tilt to one side or 
              rear back, as if in refusal. Our hands may gesture furiously, including 
              broad sweeping movements when we are truly upset. Emotional people 
              may bang their fists on the table. They may lean closer to the listener. 
              They may become agitated enough to stand up and pace. They may point 
              their finger directly at the face of the listener. They may act 
              out with their arms what they are talking about. They may wrap their 
              arms around themselves protectively. The possibilities are endless 
              and should be matched appropriately to the situation. Again, wild 
              gesturing and movement can be exciting, but only if limited to key 
              situations and points. If we begin to act this way all the time, 
              it becomes phony and annoying.<br>
              <br>
              3. <b>Eyes</b> - Regardless of what emotion we are communicating, 
              speech experts warn us that we must make direct eye-contact with 
              our hearers. Inexperienced speakers often tend to look down at their 
              notes, thus momentarily breaking the rapport they have established 
              with their hearers, and calling attention to the fact that this 
              is a planned teaching, rather than a spontaneous act of communication--exactly 
              what we <i>don't</i> want. Limit looking at your notes as much as 
              possible. Two or three times should be enough for a whole teaching, 
              because you are only checking to see if you left anything out. Inexperienced 
              speakers also tend to stare just over the heads of the audience, 
              or just below them at the floor. This helps the speaker to concentrate 
              without distraction, but either of these would earn an &quot;F&quot; 
              in speech class because they both suggest disengagement with the 
              audience. Instead, learn to slide your eyes across the audience 
              from person to person, looking directly into their eyes. </font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">4. <b>Group participation</b> - People are generally 
              stimulated when others chime in. People like to interact with their 
              peers and hear others' viewpoints, or ways of expressing the same 
              point. As discussion leaders, we are in a unique position to draw 
              on this avenue for pathos. As discussed earlier, when people begin 
              to discuss, learn to goad them on to further exertion. When someone 
              is emotional in their sharing or comments, be sure to encourage 
              them. </font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="+1">If your group is being fed with good content, and stimulated 
          by strong pathos, you have both heat and light. Such teaching have the 
          power to impact people in a lasting way</font></p>

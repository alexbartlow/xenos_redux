<h2> <font color="#CCFF33" size="+1">Planning a discussion</font> </h2>
</b> 
<p><font size="+1"> Planning a discussion begins in the same way as planning a 
  regular teaching, or lecture. </font></p>
<h3><font size="+1">If you are teaching a passage expositorily (either didactic 
  or narrative) you need to </font></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">1. Do your inductive study taking special care with the 
      &quot;strategic&quot; question. The strategic question points to the author's 
      purpose for saying what he says. That usually means your purpose as an expository 
      teacher will be similar, or at least related. To make your points seem like 
      they rise up out of the text, you need to be in line with the author's purpose, 
      although the differences between his audience and yours will dictate some 
      modifications.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">2. Then create appropriate antitheses for each strategic 
      point. The antitheses may be:<br>
      - What will happen if we fail to do, know, or believe what he says<br>
      - What we typically see in real life instead of the thesis<br>
      - The opposite of the thesis (good with abstract ideas or moral qualities)<br>
      (See sample below) Antheses are used in teaching to make the presentation 
      interesting. The violence of collision between your theses and antitheses 
      makes the teaching seem dynamic and makes your points seem important. This 
      collision, or debate, brings in the emotional component in preaching or 
      in discussion.<br>

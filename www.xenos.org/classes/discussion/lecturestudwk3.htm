<h2>Starting a discussion</h2>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <ol>
      <li><font size="+1">Start the discussion like you would any teaching. A 
        _________________ <br>
        <br>
        and ___________________________________ from you to set the stage is essential. 
        Groups come to the time of learning with their minds scattered and <br>
        <br>
        preoccupied. Only after the leader has _______________________ and <br>
        <br>
        _______________________________ can we expect good discussion.</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">After setting the stage and involving the whole group 
        in the study, present your first discussion question. It should be worded 
        well [see exercise on<br>
        <br>
        phrasing questions] and attainable. Then ____________________. Resist 
        <br>
        <br>
        _________________________________________. </font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">If nobody answers after a full 10 seconds, you can rephrase 
        the question and ask again. Don&#146;t ___________________________ (even 
        if he or she is well able to answer) as this may frighten others who imagine 
        you picking on them. Dead air is nearly always sufficient to provoke discussion.</font></li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
</ol>
<h2><font size="+1"><b> <font size="5">Pacing a discussion</font></b></font></h2>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li><font size="+1">An improperely paced discussion is frustrating and even 
      agonizing to all. The leaders is solely responsible for the pace, and must 
      use his or her authority as leader to enforce an appropriate pace.</font></li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<ol>
  <ol start="2">
    <li><font size="+1">Therefore the leader must constantly monitor the discussion, 
      evaluating whether <br>
      <br>
      _______________________________ or _________________________________ <br>
      </font></li>
    <li><font size="+1">A teacher who is more focused on covering his outline 
      than on having a deep talk <br>
      <br>
      _________________________________________. Leaders have to be prepared <br>
      <br>
      ________________________________________ if group interest spontaneously 
      leads elsewhere. If the leader often makes people change the subject, even 
      though they are pursuing it eagerly, people feel &quot;jerked around.&quot;</font></li>
    <li><font size="+1">Learn to ____________________ regarding pace and react 
      appropriately. Listen to <br>
      <br>
      ______________________________on this, as well as developing sensitivity 
      to <br>
      <br>
      ____________________________________.</font></li>

<h2><font size="+1"><b><font size="5">Responding to group comments during discussion</font></b></font></h2>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">Lowman says, &quot;A useful Classroom discussion, unlike 
        a dormitory bull session, consists of student comments separated by frequent 
        probes and clarifications by the teacher that facilitate involvement and 
        development of thinking by the whole group. Dynamic lecturers captivate 
        a class by the virtuosity of their individual performances. Exemplary 
        discussion leaders accomplish the same end by skillful guidance of the 
        group&#146;s collective thinking processes.&quot; 159</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">According to this, leaders are there to _____, not to ________________.</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">Also, &quot;Student comments are offered to the instructor 
        in the hope of approval and verification of their academic competence. 
        The quality of the instructor&#146;s response potently influences both 
        the student offering the comment and those observing the interchange.&quot; 
        165 </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">As a discussion leader, you need to take your attention 
      off self, off your outline, and onto ___________________. You need to sparkle 
      in your best personality, exuding friendliness, enthusiasm, intensity, and 
      good humor, all in proper balance. </font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">Lowman says, As the leader, your probes, comments, and 
        summaries will either urge the group on, creating excitement and participation, 
        or will dampen interest like a wet blanket. &quot;All successful discussion 
        leaders direct the group&#146;s thinking by following a series of student 
        comments with brief remarks or additional questions that build on students&#146; 
        comments.&quot; 166</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">&quot;But if teacher speaks for more than 15 seconds 
        between comments, it may turn off students motivation to speak up. Thus, 
        make your summaries very brief, and avoid launching into comments of your 
        own unless you are ready to shift focus or bring discussion to a close.&quot; 
        182</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li><font size="+1">Wait for at least __________________________ before 
        changing direction or moving discussion along with another query, or moving 
        back to lecture. On the other hand,<br>
        <br>
        students&#146; enthusiasm for responding usually wanes after ________________________<br>
        <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">In general, the leader should be very positive in response 
        to any comments from members,<br>
        <br>
        but not always. The positive response can be ___________________________________ 
        People wonder whether to risk speaking up, and they decide the question 
        partly based on how the leader responds to others who share. As the group 
        wonders corporately how much to fear the instructor, response to____________________________________________. 
        You can usually find something positive to say even in wrong responses. 
        At times, you may elect to withhold positive response, but this is unusual.<br>
        <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">At times, the leader needs to be _____________________:

        on its toes. &quot;So you&#146;re saying that anyone who has a quiet time 
        in the morning is a formalist?&quot;<br>
        <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">At other times, the need for positive reinforcement

          </blockquote>
          <p><font size="+1">6. Sometimes people will ask questions of the instructor 
            instead of giving opinion or answers. Lowman points out that students 
            learn most from struggling with a problem or issue, so you should 
            not propose a solution too quickly even if directly asked. The default 
            response should be, &quot;That&#146;s a good question. Who has an 
            idea for an answer?&quot; This kind of response turns the locus of 
            expertise back from the leader to the group. In some situations, however, 
            it may be best to answer the question yourself. What kind of questions 
            do you think might better be handled by the leader rather than turned 
            back to the group?</font> </p>
          <p><font size="+1">7. During some spontaneous discussion, members may 
            burst into angry outbursts at other members or at the leader. When 
            directed at the leader, such outbursts present no particular danger 
            to the group, as the leader will no doubt be able to respond appropriately. 
            However, when newer members of the group are the object of attack, 
            the leader must spring into action. Even when older members are attacked, 
            there is some danger that they may retaliate inappropriately. The 
            leader is responsible for mediating such disputes, calling on either 
            party or both for more self-control and understanding. Remember:</font>

                  group interaction </font> </p>
                <p><font size="+1">A panicked response from the leader or other 
                  members moving to quench the anger may do more harm than the 
                  anger itself. You must be perceived as fair and undefensive 
                  in this situation. </font> </p>
                <p><font size="+1">You may elect to speak a word of discipline 
                  to the angry one. This may depend on the severity of the outburst, 
                  whether it has been a repetitive problem, and the spiritual 
                  age and accountability of the speaker. Samples might include:

                <p><font size="+1">&quot;I see this upsets you quite a bit. Why

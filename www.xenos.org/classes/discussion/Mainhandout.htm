<p><font size="+1">We will be referring often in this class to <i>Mastering the 
  Techniques of Teaching</i> (Second Edition), Joseph Lowman (San Francisco, Josey-Bass 
  Inc., Publishers, 1995) Lowman is a recognized authority on college-age instruction. 
  All page numbers at ends of citations are from this excellent book.</font></p>
<b> 
<h2> <font color="#CCFF33" size="+1">Definition </font></h2>
</b> 
<p><font size="+1">For our purposes, discussion will refer to leader-guided or 
  moderated group discussion. This will usually follow a pattern where the leader 
  teaches partly by lecture, or at least offers an introduction and conclusion. 
  Guided discussion may involve some peer-to-peer interaction, but most of the 
  interaction will be from learners to the leader or the group in general. The 
  leader offers a short summary and comment to most, or all, sharing.</font></p>
<h2><font color="#CCFF33">Technique</font></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h3><font size="+1" color="#CCFF33">Introduction:</font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">Some discussions seem to drag in fits and awkward silences, 
    creating tension in the group that further inhibits discussion. Other discussions 
    seem to thrive in eager sharing, with people actually competing to get their 
    point in. Why is this?</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">The most likely reason for such difference is the introduction. 
    In our introduction, we touch on the skills of public speaking, or homiletics. 
    The leader must stimulate and excite the group about the subject under consideration. 
    During this first part ot the meeting, the burden is completely on the leader 
    to:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="+1">Raise the group's consciousness of the issues: Defining 
        what the issues are, and why they are urgent</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Emotionally engage the group with the subject and with 
        the leader</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Achieve arousal: People sit up, furrow their brows, smile, 
        laugh, and in other ways show that they have been impacted emotionally, 
        whether excited, disturbed, insulted (be careful with this one), or inspired.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">When people come into a meeting, they are not ready to discuss 
    anything. Most people come to meetings with cold hearts and empty minds. They 
    do not have any thoughts to share, or any desire to speak. Leaders who try 
    to start out with a discussion question are mistaken.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Achieving such arousal is not necessarily a long project. 
    It could be accomplished in a couple of minutes, although you could spend 
    up to 15 or even 20 minutes, if the you feel the need to lay a more complete 
    groundwork. These judgments are based on the subject matter and the audience. 
    Longer introductions have the potential to lay out more elaborate content, 
    but may exhaust the audience attention-span.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">To become adept at this part, consider taking a <a href="../homiletics/index.htm">class 
    in homiletics</a>.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><font color="#CCFF33">Probes</font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">The instructor will normally introduce &quot;probes&quot; 
    or questions intended to prod members toward a particular line of thought. 
    However, discussion is not recitation. Recitation is when the instructor gives 
    students an opportunity to clarify content or the instructor asks questions 
    requiring specific knowledge of study content, frequently from assigned readings 
    (like the teacher in &quot;The Paper Chase&quot;). We are not suggesting such 
    recitation is wrong or harmful, only that such is not what we are studying 
    in this class.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">What then, are these questions, or probes, that elicit discussion? 
    Several patterns are successful. Here is a partial list:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="+1">Set up an apparent contradiction in your introduction, 
        and ask the group how it might be resolved </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Ask them how a particular truth might apply either to 
        life in general, or to specific situations you imagine </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1"> Give them a statement from a third party (either imaginary 
        or an authority) and ask them to react to it </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Ask how someone from x, y, or z perspective would answer 
        a particular question </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1"> Ask what whether what you just distilled from a text 
        or narrative is different or the same as something else with which they 
        are already familiar (e.g. Is this teaching about letting each person 
        have their own conviction from Rom. 14 different in any way from relativism?) 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1"> Devil&#146;s advocacy: challenge a position they all 
        seem to accept axiomatically with some problems </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1"> Discovery: What do you think is this passage really 
        saying? </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1"> Personal experience: Who wants to share an experience 
        where this truth has made a difference? </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Comparing and contrasting: Lowman says, &quot;Asking 
        students to compare and contrast concepts, theories, and individuals orally 
        in class helps to clarify the relationships within a content area. 172 
        </font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">As learners answer each question, the leader responds with 
    a short summary statement and a further probe, until moving on to another 
    subject.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><font color="#CCFF33">Objectives</font></h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">After learning the particulars in a field of knowledge (such 
    as vocabulary and grammar rules in a language), the next stage in learning 
    is to progressively differentiate and relate the new particulars to existing 
    particulars. Discussion is particularly suitable for these later stages in 
    learning. [see exercise on Ausubel&#146;s stages of learning]</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Consider Lowman&#146;s 5 types of thinking best developed 
    in discussion: Personal identification: What would Paul have felt during his 
    imprisonment in Rome? </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="+1"><u><b>Objective or critical thinking</b></u>: What are 
        some problems with the notion of having no consciousness of sin in Heb. 
        10? Or, How would a Calvinist answer this?</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1"><u><b>Diagnostic thinking</b></u>: Ask students to draw 
        conclusions from a data set </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1"><u><b>Independent thinking</b></u>: Why did they reach 
        the conclusion they did? </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1"><u><b>As-if thinking</b></u>: Challenge them to predict 
        a future outcome based on data </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1"><u><b>Problem solving</b></u>: Asking them to propose 
        solutions to the problems under study </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1"><u><b>Increasing awareness of value controversies</b></u>: 
        &quot;These both sound good, let&#146;s hear more evidence for each </font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">Finally, consider these qualifications on leaders&#146; questions 
    by Lowman:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">Avoid questions that can be answered by short factual statements 
      or yes or no responses. Keep queries short and simple. If students must 
      work to decipher your questions, they are less likely to respond to it. 
      Discussion questions should be easily understandable by students, put forth 
      decisively, and followed by silence. [Lowman 180] </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">The underlying assumption is that as people struggle with 
      concepts and their own thoughts and feelings, they will become very receptive 
      to new information and ideas that help them resolve the questions before 
      them. Research shows that when learners struggle for answers in a area they 
      retain those answers longer and more accurately. Further, when learners 
      discuss related issues under skillful guidance, they link the ideas in an 
      associational network. Such networks are remembered far longer than isolated 
      concepts. 162</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">More importantly, such discussion has the potential to 
      develop actual thinking skills that will never result from lecture. While 
      an audience might admire and enjoy a lecturer&#146;s thinking, we have no 
      reason to believe they would be able to imitate such thinking on their own 
      in situations not mentioned in a lecture. As Lowman observes, &quot;asking 
      learners to apply in your group what they have learned [through discussion] 
      requires them to demonstrate <i>understanding</i>, not merely <i>memorization</i>.&quot; 
      162 This is what we want from our people&#151;not just the ability to do 
      what a tape-recorder can do (spit back knowledge) but to creatively handle 
      that knowledge in ways that are useful in ministry and Christian living.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">Seen this way, we realize discussion is an essential type 
    of instruction where learners get to try their own wings like baby birds. 
    I believe a guided discussion format is <i>the best</i> approach for many 
    Xenos cell groups, small groups, and home churches. Authorities agree that 
    even in large groups of over 100 a skillful lecturer can incorporate periods 
    of interaction with good effect.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">However, guidance is essential. Many discussions lead nowhere, 
    and any conclusions reached are not memorable. As Lowman says, &quot;Discussion 
    should be for an intended purpose, not simply to hear students&#146; voices.&quot; 
    The notion that any discussion or interaction will naturally lead to advancement 
    in learners&#146; lives is naïve.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><font color="#CCFF33">Leader's Responses</font></h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">The leader guides the discussion with responses to what people 
    say. It is common for the leader to respond to virtually every person who 
    speaks with short responses calculated to clarify what is being said while 
    keeping the discussion moving forward in the right direction.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">This responding by the leader is a very complicated skill, 
    made more difficult by the immediacy of discussion. Little planning is possible 
    when it comes to offering responses. On the other hand, many aspects of this 
    skill are common to good conversation in general and become instinctual after 
    some practice. Consider what the leader must do in order to offer good responses:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">Listen carefully to each point, with eye-contact, nodding, 
      smiling, showing recognition or concern as appropriate</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Immediately summarize in a sentence or two what was just 
      said, and relate it to the topic if necessary </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Determine without hesitation whether to challenge the point, 
      to affirm it, to show reservation, to call for clarification, to move on 
      to another subject, etc. </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Instantly compose and introduce another question, or probe</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Introduce energy, enthusiasm, humor, and friendliness into 
      the discussion </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Watch the clock mentally and keep things moving in a timely 
      way&#151;interrupting wordy sharing if necessary </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1"> Introducing blocks of content from time to time which 
      can serve as further fodder for discussion </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">When the discussion leader learns to do all these things 
    by habit and instinct, leading discussion becomes an enjoyable and relaxing 
    way to teach. She is able to draw on the gifts and knowledge of fellow Christians 
    in the group for help rather than feeling responsible for a solo performance. 
    While not as glorifying to the leader as a blockbuster sermon, a rich discussion 
    will leave members feeling like they contributed, learned, and heard God speak 
    to their hearts. Viewed this way, we see that leading discussion is one of 
    the most self-effacing modes of teaching.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<h2> <b><font color="#CCFF66">Background Factors </font></b></h2> 
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">To maximize the effectiveness of discussion, leaders should 
    realize the importance of a number of background factors.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Discussion is easier when all the students can see each other 
    and the instructor. It&#146;s a mistake to set your room up in rows of chairs 
    facing one direction when your goal is discussion. Have you ever had a discussion 
    with the back of someone&#146;s head? De-emphasize hierarchical relationship 
    between teacher and students as much as possible: </font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">Avoid hinting that teacher already has a good answer that 
    the students must guess. &quot;No, that&#146;s not quite it.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">In egalitarian discussion, avoid seeing discussion as a chance 
    for the powerful teacher to test the students&#146; mettle. Such would be 
    recitation, not discussion</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Seating can be suggestive of hierarchical leadership or of 
    facilitating leadership. Think about how your room is arranged and how the 
    leader presents herself. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">A podium of any kind is a very questionable addition.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"> Begin with &quot;let&#146;s see what we can discover about.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot; 
    or &quot;What are we to make of this?&quot; to emphasize that he too, is participating 
    in the process. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Skillful leaders discourage competition among learners by 
    not encouraging members to show off that they know it all </font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">Discussion should not be allowed to become an avenue for 
    members to demolish each other&#146;s comments. </font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">Members should be conditioned to participate in discussion 
    from the outset of a group. Lowman 178 </font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">Discussion is especially stimulating for students who speak, 
    but thinking is also stimulated in those who merely listen to their classmates 
    and consider what they might have said themselves. 163<br>
    <b><br>
    </b> </font> </p>
</blockquote>
<h2> <b><font color="#99FF33">Potential Strengths </font></b></h2> 
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">Discussion is uniquely capable of teaching people:</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">To approach a problem or topic rationally, To monitor their 
    own thinking processes To question their implicit assumptions. </font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">It also tells the instructor how completely the information 
    has been absorbed. By engaging in discussion, the leaders is able to appreciate 
    quickly which members understand in a deep way, and which ones need more help.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Discussion promotes independence because for the most part, 
    students must come up with responses on their own during discussion. Such 
    independent creativity is identical to what they must do when they use the 
    same concepts in real life. Lecture centers on the speaker&#146;s thinking. 
    Discussion centers on the learners&#146; thinking.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Discussion is particularly good at revealing students&#146; 
    attitudes, and these will likely never come out in other forms of teaching. 
    When we see attitudes, we see our work as leaders cut out for us. The members 
    themselves may not realize until after a good discussion what their own attitudes 
    were.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Lowman says, &quot;An instructor who, by means of discussion, 
    asks for students&#146; opinions communicates that he or she cares about their 
    reactions.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Discussion enhances rapport between student and teacher 
    partly because it gives instructors so many chances to show acceptance of 
    student ideas.&quot; 165 Viewed this way, leading discussion is an opportunity 
    for leaders (and other members as well) to encourage and build up people who 
    share. We will often find issues coming up that we can pray for in each other&#146;s 
    lives.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">According to Lowman, &quot;Student comments are offered to 
    the instructor in the hope of approval and verification of their academic 
    competence. The quality of the instructor&#146;s response potently influences 
    both the student offering the comment and those observing the interchange.&quot; 
    165 Leaders are able to motivate whole groups to become sharper, more effective 
    sharers. Members who see themselves as victorious contributors to the group 
    discussion will invest more at every level, both at meetings, and when alone 
    at home. These can, in turn, become the building blocks of future spoken ministries 
    by members.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">It is possible that leading discussion might involve more 
    learned skills than does effective preaching. Good preaching often seems possible 
    for some, but not for others. Leading discussion also draws on the abilities 
    of the group, which in our context, include mature Christians who are ready 
    to help.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<h2> <b><font color="#CCFF33">Potential Weaknesses</font> </b></h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1"> But discussion is by no means always successful. Good discussions 
    seem spontaneous to visitors, but they are not. Leading disucssion is no easier 
    than good lecturing: </font> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">&quot;Discussions must be well planned in order to be effective, 
      but their quality also depends greatly on how well the instructor performs. 
      Leading excellent discussion demands just as much stage presence, leadership, 
      and energy as presenting a lecture&#151;and considerably more interpersonal 
      understanding and communication skill. Because of these additional requirements, 
      some educators believe that leading an outstanding discussion is more difficult 
      than giving a lecture of comparable quality.&quot; 161</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">&quot;A discussion leader who lets students talk on and 
      on with little control or direction will soon lose the group&#146;s attention.&quot; 
      165</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Discussion is probably not effective for presenting new 
      information, which the student is already motivated to learn. Though not 
      effective for presenting content per se, discussion does aid its mastery 
      by encouraging students to actively process what they learn as they sit 
      in class. Discussion helps students assimilate and integrate information

    demonstration, etc.&quot; 174 </font></p>

<h2> <b><font color="#CCFF33">Planning a discussion</font> </b></h2>
<p><font size="+1"> Planning a discussion begins in the same way as planning a 
  regular teaching, or lecture. </font></p>
<h3><font size="+1">If you are teaching a passage expositorily (either didactic 
  or narrative) you need to </font></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">1. Do your inductive study taking special care with the 
      &quot;strategic&quot; question. The strategic question points to the author's 
      purpose for saying what he says. That usually means your purpose as an expository 
      teacher will be similar. To make your points seem like they rise up out 
      of the text, you need to be in line with the author's purpose, although 
      the differences between his audience and yours will dictate some modifications.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">2. Then create appropriate antitheses for each strategic 
      point. The antitheses may be:<br>
      - What will happen if we fail to do, know, or believe what he says<br>
      - What we typically see in real life instead of the thesis<br>
      - The opposite of the thesis (good with abstract ideas or moral qualities)<br>
      (See sample below) Antheses are used in teaching to make the presentation 
      interesting. The violence of collision between your theses and antitheses 
      makes the teaching seem dynamic and makes your points seem important. This 
      collision, or debate, brings in the emotional component in preaching or 
      in discussion.<br>

<h2><b><font color="#CCFF00">Running a Discussion</font></b></h2>
<blockquote> 
  <h2><b><font color="#CCFF33">Starting Discussion</font></b></h2>
  <p><font size="+1">Start the discussion like you would any teaching. A lively 
    introduction and a period of up-beat explanation from you to set the stage 
    is essential. Groups come to the time of learning with their minds scattered 
    and preoccupied. <i>Only after the leader has focused attention and stimulated 
    people emotionally </i>can we expect good discussion. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">After setting the stage and involving the whole group in 
    the study, present your first discussion question. It should be worded well 
    [see exercise on phrasing questions] and attainable. Then wait in silence. 
    Resist the urge to answer your own question or to talk to fill the silence. 
    The awkwardness you feel is also felt by the members of the group, and they 
    will usually respond by answering the question. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">If nobody answers after a full 10 seconds of silence, you 
    can rephrase the question and ask again. If you are teaching a home church, 
    don&#146;t pick on someone to answer (even if he or she is well able to answer) 
    as this may frighten new people who imagine you picking on them. Cell groups 
    may allow for picking on people, but dead air is nearly always sufficient 
    to provoke discussion.</font></p>
  <h2><small><font color="#CCFF33">Pacing a discussion</font></small> </h2>
  <p><font size="+1">An improperely paced discussion is frustrating and even agonizing 
    to all. The leader is solely responsible for the pace, and must use his or 
    her authority as leader to enforce their will regarding pace. </font> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1"> A rushed pace leaves everyone feeling frustrated and angry 
      that they aren&#146;t getting a chance to share their views, or that people 
      are being cut off before they finish. They may feel disgusted that the subject 
      was only superficially discussed. </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1"> A slow pace leaves people bored and frustrated. Unimportant 
      and uninteresting rabbit trails take up most of the time, or obvious points 
      are repeated <i>ad nauseum</i> in different words. People don&#146;t feel 
      like they are being challenged or learning anything. </font> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">Therefore the leader must constantly monitor the discussion, 
    evaluating whether people are excited and involved (either verbally or non-verbally) 
    or whether they are losing interest. Also assess whether the content is worth 
    hearing. Generally, if people are interested and engaged, let them talk. But 
    continue to move the subject forward as needed.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">A lively discussion may take you away from your anticipated 
    outline. But a teacher who is more focused on covering his outline than on 
    having a deep talk makes a poor discussion leader. Leaders have to be prepared 
    to drop or alter plans if group interest spontaneously leads elsewhere. If 
    the group moves into deep spiritual truth, and feel blessed by building each 
    other up, why must the teacher insist on a certain outline? We should always 
    have more material on hand than will actually be discusses in any event. High 
    control people have trouble with the spontaneity and unpredictability of group 
    discussion. As Lowman points out, &quot;Because discussion is much more unpredictable 
    than lecturing, it requires considerable instructor spontaneity, creativity, 
    and tolerance for the unknown.&quot; 159 Learn to read the situation regarding 
    pace and react appropriately. Listen to feedback after meetings on this, as 
    well as developing sensitivity to the facial and body signals from the group 
    during discussion. <br>

    <h2> <b><font color="#CCFF33">Responding to group comments during discussion</font> 
      </b></h2> 
    <p><font size="+1">Lowman says, &quot;A useful Classroom discussion, unlike 
      a dormitory bull session, consists of student comments separated by frequent 
      probes and clarifications by the teacher that facilitate involvement and 
      development of thinking by the whole group. Dynamic lecturers captivate 
      a class by the virtuosity of their individual performances. Exemplary discussion 
      leaders accomplish the same end by skillful guidance of the group&#146;s 
      collective thinking processes.&quot; 159</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">According to this, leaders are there to lead, not to passively 
      listen.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Finally, &quot;Student comments are offered to the instructor 
      in the hope of approval and verification of their academic competence. The 
      quality of the instructor&#146;s response potently influences both the student 
      offering the comment and those observing the interchange.&quot; 165 When 
      considering response options, remember the folowing:</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">As a discussion leader, you need to take your attention 
      off self, off your outline, and onto what people are saying. You need to 
      sparkle in your best personality, exuding friendliness, enthusiasm, intensity, 
      and good humor, all in proper balance. </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1"> As the leader, your probes, comments, and summaries will 
      either urge the group on, creating excitement and participation, or will 
      dampen interest like a wet blanket. &quot;All successful discussion leaders 
      direct the group&#146;s thinking by following a series of student comments 
      with brief remarks or additional questions that build on students&#146; 
      comments.&quot; 166 [see exercise on summarizing] </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">&quot;But if the teacher speaks for more than 15 seconds 
      between comments, it may turn off students motivation to speak up. Thus, 
      make your summaries very brief, and avoid launching into comments of your 
      own unless you are ready to shift focus or bring discussion to a close.&quot; 
      182 </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Wait for at least two or three comments before changing 
      direction or moving discussion along with another query, or moving back 
      to lecture. </font> </p>
    <p><font size="+1">On the other hand, students&#146; enthusiasm for responding 
      usually wanes after five of six comments and the instructor must then exert 
      leadership once again. [see Lowman, 182,3] </font> </p>
    <p><font size="+1">In general, the leader should be very positive in response 
      to any comments from members, but not always. The positive response can 
      be a challenge, especially when people aren&#146;t saying what you hoped 
      they would. People wonder whether to risk speaking up, and they decide the 
      question partly based on how the leader responds to others who share. As 
      the group wonders corporately how much to fear the instructor, response 
      to dumb points is more important than response to obviously brilliant answers. 
      You can usually find something positive to say even in wrong responses. 
      </font> </p>
    <p><font size="+1">At times, you may elect to withhold positive response, 
      but this is unusual. At times, the leader needs to be provocative. Provocative 
      discussions in which assumptions are questioned require that instructors 
      become highly involved in the group&#146;s problem solving as gadflies or 
      devil&#146;s advocates, working to keep the group on its toes. </font> </p>

        time in the morning is a formalist?&quot; </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">At other times, the need for positive reinforcement collides 
      with the need to advance learning and truth. &quot;A discussion leader who 
      lets students talk on and on with little control or direction will soon 
      lose the groups attention.&quot; (165) </font> </p>
    <p><font size="+1">Responding to statements that are clearly untrue or that 
      take the discussion in a direction other than what you as leader want present

    <p><font size="+1">Sometimes people will ask questions of the instructor instead 
      of giving opinion or answers. Lowman points out that students learn most 
      from struggling with a problem or issue, so you should not propose a solution 
      too quickly even if directly asked. The default response should be, &quot;That&#146;s 
      a good question. Who has an idea for an answer?&quot; This kind of response 
      turns the locus of expertise back from the leader to the group. In some 
      situations, however, it may be best to answer the question yourself. What 
      kind of questions do you think might better be handled by the leader rather 
      than turned back to the group? </font> </p>
    <p><font size="+1"> During some spontaneous discussion, members may burst 
      into angry outbursts at other members or at the leader. When directed at 
      the leader, such outbursts present no particular danger to the group, as 
      the leader will no doubt be able to respond appropriately. However, when 
      newer members of the group are the object of attack, the leader must spring 
      into action. Even when older members are attacked, there is some danger 
      that they may retaliate inappropriately. The leader is responsible for mediating 
      such disputes, calling on either party or both for more self-control and 
      understanding. </font> </p>
    <p><font size="+1">Remember: </font> </p>
    <p><font size="+1"> The presence of anger is not necessarily a bad thing in 
      group interaction </font> </p>
    <p><font size="+1">A panicked response from the leader or other members moving 
      to quench the anger may do more harm than the anger itself. You must be 
      perceived as fair and undefensive in this situation. </font> </p>
    <p><font size="+1"> You may elect to speak a word of discipline to the angry 
      one. This may depend on the severity of the outburst, whether it has been 
      a repetitive problem, and the spiritual age and accountability of the speaker. 
      Samples might include: </font> </p>

    <p><font size="+1"> When someone shares a good point, we need a collection 
      of possible responses. A leader who simply says &quot;that&#146;s a good 
      point&quot; is not necessarily advancing the discussion. Try to assess how 
      to acknowledge and appreciate the point, summarize the point, while at the 
      same time deciding whether to doing one of the following (this takes fast 
      thinking on your feet): </font> </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="+1">Ask for a further distinction or relationship between 
          the point just shared and something else said earlier: &quot;Is what 
          you&#146;re saying the same as what Pam said or different?&quot; &quot;How 
          would you distinguish between this and what the faith-healers teach?&quot; 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">Refine or clarify the point: &quot;I don&#146;t think 
          you&#146;re saying this are you?&quot; &quot;So do you think this &#145;turning 
          the cheek&#146; also applies to governments?&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1"> Ask for exceptions to the point: &quot;Are there any 
          cases you can think of where this wouldn&#146;t apply?&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">Ask for further implications of the point: &quot;I 
          think this might apply in some other areas too. Can anyone think of 
          examples?&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1"> Ask for qualifications to the point: &quot;This is 
          a good point, but can anyone think of qualification we should add?&quot; 
          The typical pattern for group lessons is a series of points made by 
          the leader, interspersed with periods of discussion. Breaking out of 
          discussion and back into lecture is usually very natural after fielding 
          a comment: </font></p>
        <p> <font size="+1">&quot;Thanks! That was very well-said. Now I&#146;d 
          like us to look at verse 5 for a minute.&quot; </font></p>
        <p> <font size="+1">&quot;Good, that really puts a point on it. Now let&#146;s 
          look at a related point.&quot; If they have skipped points, say, &quot;Let&#146;s 
          finish up on that point before we go on.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot; Or &quot;I 
          still didn&#146;t hear how we are supposed to understand sowing and 
          reaping in light of grace&quot; Don&#146;t assume new, unexpected directions 
          are bad. Ask yourself whether they have potential and whether you have 
          time. If the group is excited about the new direction, you smay want

    <blockquote>

    </blockquote>
    <ol>
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font size="+1">- &quot;Content per minute&quot; has to be properly 
            paced. Too little content per minute makes people feel like they are 
            being patronized, as obvious points are repeated or belabored in an 
            unenlightening way. Too much content per minute leads to confusion. 
            We believe too much content is better than too little. We would rather 
            have people challenged than bored.</font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">- Content that is provocative, either of previous 
            assumptions, or of listeners' lifestyles, tends to be stimulating. 
            But use tact and care, because while insulting people may be interesting 
            and create feelings, we will not usually win the day this way.</font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">- Content that is new and unknown to listeners may 
            cause excitement, but only if we can show them why they would benefit 
            from learning something new, or why it is simply interesting. Also, 
            new content must be backed up with convincing evidence, because people 
            are more suspicious of new content.</font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">- Some content is simply not that interesting. Ask 
            yourself, &quot;Would I be interested in this subject if I wasn't 
            teaching?&quot; If not, you have to be creative enough to make it 
            interesting, or edit it out. Some truths are uninteresting because 
            they don't seem to apply or tie in with other knowledge. We have tried 
            to show you how to use thesis-antithesis thinking to make otherwise 
            dry content interesting. Likewise, strong illustrations, personal 
            sharing, and applying as you go can all make content interesting.</font></p>

        2. Leader pathos -- Study the <a href="../homiletics/effectpreach.htm">outline

    </blockquote>
    <ol>
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font size="+1">- Pathos is feeling. The truth is important and should 
            be served up with some feeling--otherwise we are sending mixed signals. 
            &quot;This is the most important truth in the world, but it doesn't 
            move me to raise my voice.&quot; </font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">- To create feeling, the speaker should actually 
            feel. When we let ourselves feel the urgency of our message, we are 
            said to have a &quot;burden&quot; for the material. We develop a burden 
            through prayer and wrestling with accusation and apathy during the 
            days before we teach. This is a good reason to avoid waiting until 
            the day before to prepare. Sometimes, our burden has to be taken on 
            faith, in the sense that we won't actually feel the zeal until we 
            actually step up to speak.</font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">- Leader inhibition causes us to want to be &quot;cool&quot; 
            when teaching, and not risk being viewed as foolish. While extreme 
            or corny displays would be considered foolish, most of us are in NO 
            DANGER of suffering this fate! Video taping your teaching will confirm 
            that most of us are much more reserved and inhibited than we think.</font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">- Consider the components of strong emotional communication:</font></p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font size="+1">1. <b>Voice</b> - emotion is noticeable in the 
              way we speak. An even, calm tone suggests a lack of emotion. Strong 
              emotional speech is variable -- The tone of our voice should rise 
              and fall in volume and in pitch. Also, emotional speech is generally 
              louder (unless expressing grief or similar). Try going extreme in 
              pitch and volume once in awhile on key points. Learn to throw the 
              hardball, but save it for key points. Also, unusual ways of bending 
              words, speaking with staccato gaps, repetition of phrases, and exaggerated, 
              slow or fast speech all attract waning attention and arouse curiosity. 
              Again, the important thing is not to throw all hardballs, but to 
              vary our approach. Intense fury is most impacting when juxtaposed 
              with happiness, humor, appeals, or sorrow. Throwing any pitch too 
              often becomes either boring, or even annoying.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">2. <b>Face</b> - Research confirms that much of 
              what we communicate emotionally is transmitted through the face. 
              When teaching, especially a home church or cell, you are easily 
              close enough to people for them to get a good look at your face. 
              Think about people who are emotional. How does their emotional state 
              affect their faces? Faces that are screwed up in agony, faces with 
              huge, happy smiles, faces that are solicitous or sympathetic, faces 
              that are disturbed or suspicious, all help to convey strong pathos. 
              A deadpan face suggest lack of interest and perfunctory discussion, 
              unmoved by the subject. What a terrible mistake to communicate God's 
              word that way!</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">3. <b>Body language</b> - When people are emotional, 
              you can tell from their body language. Unemotional people are stationary, 
              calm, and relaxed. Emotional people become agitated and their body 
              movements become pronounced. The head may begin to bob or jerk with 
              our speech, punctuating phrases. The head may tilt to one side or 
              rear back, as if in refusal. Our hands may gesture furiously, including 
              broad sweeping movements when we are truly upset. Emotional people 
              may bang their fists on the table. They may lean closer to the listener. 
              They may become agitated enough to stand up and pace. They may point 
              their finger directly at the face of the listener. They may act 
              out with their arms what they are talking about. They may wrap their 
              arms around themselves protectively. The possibilities are endless 
              and should be matched appropriately to the situation. Again, wild 
              gesturing and movement can be exciting, but only if limited to key 
              situations and points. If we begin to act this way all the time, 
              it becomes phony and annoying.<br>
              <br>
              3. <b>Eyes</b> - Regardless of what emotion we are communicating, 
              speech experts warn us that we must make direct eye-contact with 
              our hearers. Inexperienced speakers often tend to look down at their 
              notes, thus momentarily breaking the rapport they have established 
              with their hearers, and calling attention to the fact that this 
              is a planned teaching, rather than a spontaneous act of communication--exactly 
              what we <i>don't</i> want. Limit looking at your notes as much as 
              possible. Two or three times should be enough for a whole teaching, 
              because you are only checking to see if you left anything out. Inexperienced 
              speakers also tend to stare just over the heads of the audience, 
              or just below them at the floor. This helps the speaker to concentrate 
              without distraction, but either of these would earn an &quot;F&quot; 
              in speech class because they both suggest disengagement with the 
              audience. Instead, learn to slide your eyes across the audience 
              from person to person, looking directly into their eyes. </font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">4. <b>Group participation</b> - People are generally 
              stimulated when others chime in. People like to interact with their 
              peers and hear others' viewpoints, or ways of expressing the same 
              point. As discussion leaders, we are in a unique position to draw 
              on this avenue for pathos. As discussed earlier, when people begin 
              to discuss, learn to goad them on to further exertion. When someone 
              is emotional in their sharing or comments, be sure to encourage 
              them. </font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="+1">If your group is being fed with good content, and stimulated 
          by strong pathos, you have both heat and light. Such teaching have the 
          power to impact people in a lasting way</font></p>

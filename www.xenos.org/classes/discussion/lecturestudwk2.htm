<h1>Planning a discussion</h1>
Planning a discussion begins in the same way as planning a regular teaching, or 
lecture. 
<p> 
</b> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><b><img src="../../graphics/ball_blu.gif" width="14" height="14" hspace="11">If 
    you are teaching a passage expositorily (either didactic or narrative) you 
    need to:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">1. Do your inductive study taking special care with the 
      &quot;____________&quot; question. The strategic question points to the 
      author's purpose for saying what he says. That usually means your purpose 
      as an expository teacher will be similar, or at least related. To make your 
      points seem like they rise up out of the text, you need to _______________ 
      the author's purpose, although the differences between his audience and 
      yours will dictate some modifications.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">2. Then create appropriate ______________ for each strategic 
      point. The antitheses may be:<br>
      - What will happen if we _________ do, know, or believe what he says<br>
      - What we typically see in ___________ instead of the thesis<br>
      - The ______________ of the thesis (good with abstract ideas or moral qualities)<br>
      (See sample below) Antheses are used in teaching to make the presentation 
      interesting. The violence of collision between your theses and antitheses 
      makes the teaching seem dynamic and makes your points seem important. This 
      collision, or debate, brings in the emotional component in preaching or 
      in discussion.</font></p>

        of them. Whether it would apply in a literal sense to all Christians is 
        doubtful. 
      <p> Vs. 8 Love includes affection and feelings, not just doing and serving. 
        The &quot;affection of Christ&quot; must refer to Jesus warm-heartedness. 
      <p> Love contains the component of knowledge or that love is contained by 
        knowledge, or truth. These are not antithetical or inversely proportional.

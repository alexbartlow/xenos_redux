<p>When summarizing what people share, you can often correct something someone 
  said that was corny, or churchy, or insensitive to guests. The teacher should 
  always be on watch for jargon and non-user-friendly language and immediately 
  say, &quot;Oh so you're saying...&quot; with appropriate language substituted 
  for the former. Of course, you have to be quick on your feet to translate such 
  language quickly. Also, if a point was made that is too extreme, or unqualified, 
  you may correct it by either adding your own qualifications or balance points, 
  or calling on the sharer to do so. You also have to consider whether to disassociate 
  yourself from what was said.</p>
<p>Try your hand at these imaginary comments by having one member of the group 
  read each to one of the other members. Then compare other possibilities like 
  before.</p>

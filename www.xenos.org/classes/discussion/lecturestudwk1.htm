<p><font size="+2">We will be referring often in this class to <i>Mastering the 
  Techniques of Teaching</i> (Second Edition), Joseph Lowman (San Francisco, Josey-Bass 
  Inc., Publishers, 1995) Lowman is a recognized authority on college-age instruction.

<p><font size="+2">Definition:</font></p>
<p><font size="+2"><br>
  </font></p>
</b></font> 
<h2><font size="+2">Technique</font></h2>
<h3><font size="+2">Introduction:</font></h3>
<p><font size="+2">Some discussions seem to drag in fits and awkward silences, 
  creating tension in the group that further inhibits discussion. Other discussions 
  seem to thrive in eager sharing, with people actually competing to get their 
  point in. Why is this?</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">The most likely reason for such difference is the introduction. 
  In our introduction, we touch on the skills of public speaking, or homiletics. 
  The leader must stimulate and excite the group about the subject under consideration. 
  During this first part ot the meeting, the burden is completely on the leader 
  to:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+2">Raise the group's ______________________: Defining what 
        the __________, and why they are _________</font></p>
      <p><font size="+2">_______________________ the group with the subject and 
        with the leader</font></p>
      <p><font size="+2">Achieve ________: People sit up, furrow their brows, 
        smile, laugh, and in other ways show that they have been _________________, 
        whether excited, disturbed, insulted (be careful with this one), or inspired.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+2">When people come into a meeting, they are not ready to discuss 
  anything. Most people come to meetings with _____________ and _____________. 
  They do not have any thoughts to share, or any desire to speak. Leaders who 
  try to start out with a discussion question are mistaken.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">Achieving such arousal is not necessarily a _______________. 
  It could be accomplished in a couple of minutes, although you could spend up 
  to 15 or even 20 minutes, if the you feel the need to lay a more complete groundwork. 
  These judgments are based on the subject matter and the audience. Longer introductions 
  have the potential to lay out more elaborate content, but may exhaust the audience 
  _________________.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">To become adept at this part, consider taking a class in _____________.</font></p>
<h3><font size="+2"><b>Probes:</b></font></h3>

  <p><font size="+2">Patterns:</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+2"><b>Consider Lowman&#146;s 6 types of thinking best developed 
  in discussion:</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+2">1.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+2">2.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+2">3.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+2">4.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+2">5.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+2">6.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+2">7.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+2"><strong>Finally, consider these qualifications on leaders&#146; 
  questions by Lowman:</strong></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+2"><strong>1.</strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="+2"><strong>2.</strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="+2"><strong>3.</strong></font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+2">The underlying assumption is that as people struggle with concepts 
  and their own thoughts and feelings, they will become very receptive to new 
  information and ideas that help them resolve the questions before them. Research 
  shows that when learners struggle for answers in a area they retain those answers 
  longer and more accurately. Further, when learners discuss related issues under 
  skillful guidance, they link the ideas in an associational network. Such networks 
  are remembered far longer than isolated concepts. 162</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">More importantly, such discussion has the potential to develop 
  actual thinking skills that will never result from lecture. While an audience 
  might admire and enjoy a lecturer&#146;s thinking, we have no reason to believe 
  they would be able to imitate such thinking on their own in situations not mentioned 
  in a lecture. As Lowman observes, &quot;asking learners to apply in your group 
  what they have learned [through discussion] requires them to demonstrate understanding, 
  not merely memorization.&quot; 162 This is what we want from our people&#151;not 
  just the ability to do what a tape-recorder can do (spit back knowledge) but 
  to creatively handle that knowledge in ways that are useful in ministry and 
  Christian living.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">Seen this way, we realize discussion is an essential type of 
  instruction where learners get to try their own wings like baby birds. I believe 
  a guided discussion format is the best approach for many Xenos cell groups, 
  small groups, and home churches to use most of the time. Authorities agree that 
  even in large groups of over 100 a skillful lecturer can incorporate periods 
  of interaction with good effect.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">However, _________ is essential. Many discussions lead nowhere, 
  and any conclusions reached are not memorable.</font></p>
<h2><font size="+2">Responses</font></h2>
<p><font size="+2">The leader guides the discussion with responses to what people 
  say. The leader normally responds to _______________________ with ______ responses 
  calculated to clarify what is being said while keeping discussion moving forward 
  in the right direction.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">This responding by the leader is a very complicated skill, 
  made more difficult by the immediacy of discussion. Little planning is possible 
  when it comes to offering responses. On the other hand, many aspects of this 
  skill are common to good conversation in general and becomes instinctual after 
  some practice. Consider what the leader must do in order to offer good responses:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+2">1.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+2">2.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+2">3.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+2">4.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+2">5.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+2">6.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+2">7.<br>
      </font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+2">When the discussion leader learns to do all these things by 
  habit and instinct, leading discussion becomes an enjoyable and relaxing way 
  to teach. She is able to draw on the gifts and knowledge of fellow Christians 
  in the group for help rather than feeling responsible for a solo performance.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">While not as glorifying to the leader as a blockbuster sermon, 
  a rich discussion will leave members feeling like they contributed, learned, 
  and heard God speak to their hearts. It also helps develop social ties and understanding 
  between members. Viewed this way, we see that leading discussion is one of the 
  most self-effacing modes of teaching.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">Many teachers feel uneasy with guided discussion, and prefer 
  lecture. This could reflect a fear of losing control. The spontaneity and unpredictability 
  of discussion strikes fear into the heart of those who lack confidence in their 
  own knowledge of Scripture, in God&#146;s leadership of the group, and in the 
  capabilities of fellow leaders. Or, to put it differently, heavy controllers 
  make poor discussion leaders.</font></p>
<font size="4"><b>
<p><font size="+2">Background Factors</font></p>
</b></font> 
<p><font size="+2">To maximize the effectiveness of discussion, leaders should 
  realize the importance of a number of background factors.</font></p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li><font size="+2">Discussion is easier when all the students can________________________________. 
      </font></li>
    <li><font size="+2">De-emphasize ____________________________ between teacher 
      and students as much as possible: <br>
      -<br>
      -<br>
      - <br>
      </font></li>
    <li><font size="+2">Skillful leaders discourage competition among learners 
      by ________________________________</font></li>
    <li><font size="+2">Discussion should not be allowed to _________________________________________</font></li>
    <li><font size="+2">Members should be conditioned to participate in discussion______________________. 
      Lowman 178</font></li>
    <li><font size="+2">Discussion is especially stimulating for students who 
      ______, but thinking is also stimulated in those who_________________________________________________. 
      163</font></li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<font size="4"><b>
<p><font size="+2">Potential Strengths</font></p>
</b></font> 
<p><font size="+2">Discussion is uniquely capable of teaching people:<br>
  -<br>

  - </font></p>
<p><font size="+2">It also tells the instructor how completely the________________________________.<br>
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+2">Discussion promotes ____________ because __________________________________<br>
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+2">Discussion is particularly good at revealing students&#146; 
  ___________ <br>
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+2">Lowman says, &quot;An instructor who, by means of discussion, 
  asks for students&#146; opinions communicates that he or she cares about their 
  reactions.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Discussion enhances rapport between student and teacher 
  partly because it gives instructors so many chances to show acceptance of student 
  ideas.&quot; 165 <br>
  <br>
  Viewed this way, leading discussion is an opportunity for _______________________________</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">According to Lowman, &quot;Student comments are offered to 
  the instructor in the hope of approval and verification of their academic competence. 
  The quality of the instructor&#146;s response potently influences both the student 
  offering the comment and those observing the interchange.&quot; 165</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">Discussion leaders are able to _____________ whole groups to<br>
  <br>
  ________________________. Members who see themselves as victorious contributors 
  to the <br>
  <br>
  group discussion will_____________________________________________________. 
  These <br>
  <br>
  can, in turn, become the building blocks of________________________________________.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">It is possible that leading discussion might involve more learned 
  skills than does effective preaching. Good preaching often seems possible for 
  some, but not for others. Leading discussion also draws on the abilities of 
  the group, which in our context, include mature Christians who are ready to 
  help.</font></p>
<h2><font size="+2">Potential Weaknesses</font></h2>
<p><font size="+2">Teachers who understand, embrace, and practice discussion leading 
  will gain an important tool in their arsenal. Groups led by good discussion 
  leaders tend to be engaged, interested, and enthusiastic. Discussion should 
  not be the only mode of instruction, but it will enhance other modes by supplying 
  what they cannot.<br>

<p><b><font size="5">Starting a discussion</font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">Start the discussion like you would any teaching. A 
    lively introduction and a period of up-beat explanation from you to set the 
    stage is essential. Groups come to the time of learning with their minds scattered 
    and preoccupied. Only after the leader has focused attention and stimulated 
    people emotionally can we expect good discussion.</font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">After setting the stage and involving the whole group 
    in the study, present your first discussion question. It should be worded 
    well [see exercise on phrasing questions] and attainable, but not over-simplfied, 
    which is boring. Then wait in silence. Resist the urge to answer your own 
    question or to talk to fill the silence. The awkwardness you feel is also 
    felt by the members of the group, and they will usually respond by answering 
    the question. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">If nobody answers after a full 10 seconds, you can rephrase 
    the question and ask again. Don&#146;t pick on someone to answer (even if 
    he or she is well able to answer) as this may frighten others who imagine 
    you picking on them. Dead air is nearly always sufficient to provoke discussion. 
    </font></p>
</blockquote>
<font face="verdana, arial, helvetica">
<p><font face="Times" size="5"><b>Pacing a discussion</b></font></p>
</font> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">1. An improperely paced discussion is frustrating and even 
    agonizing to all. The leaders is solely responsible for the pace, and must 
    use his or her authority as leader to enforce their will regarding pace. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1"> -<b>A rushed pace</b> leaves everyone feeling frustrated 
        and angry that they aren&#146;t getting a chance to share their views, 
        or that people are being cut off before they finish. They may feel disgusted 
        that the subject was only superficially discussed. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">-<b>A slow pace</b> leaves people bored and frustrated. 
        Unimportant and uninteresting rabbit trails take up most of the time, 
        or obvious points are repeated <i>ad nauseum</i> in different words. People 
        don&#146;t feel like they are being challenged or learning anything. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">2. Therefore, the leader must constantly monitor the discussion, 
    evaluating whether people are excited and involved (either verbally or non-verbally) 
    or losing interest and whether the content is worth hearing. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">3. Generally, if people are interested and engaged, let them 
    talk. But continue to move the subject forward as needed. A teacher who is 
    more focused on covering his outline than on having a deep talk makes a poor 
    discussion leader. Leaders have to be prepared to drop or alter plans if group 
    interest spontaneously leads elsewhere. If the group moves into deep spiritual 
    truth, and feel blessed by building each other up, why must the teacher insist 
    on a certain outline? We should always have more material on hand than will 
    actually be discusses in any event. If the leader often makes people change 
    the subject, even though they are pursuing it eagerly, people feel &quot;jerked 
    around.&quot; High control people have trouble with the spontaneity and unpredictability 
    of group discussion. As Lowman points out, </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">&quot;Because discussion is much more unpredictable than 
      lecturing, it requires considerable instructor spontaneity, creativity, 
      and tolerance for the unknown.&quot; 159 </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">4. Learn to read the situation regarding pace and react appropriately. 
    Listen to feedback on this after meetings. Also, develop sensitivity to the 
    facial and body signals from the group during discussion. </font></p>
</blockquote>

  
<p><font size="5"><b>Responding to group comments during discussion</b></font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">Lowman says, &quot;A useful Classroom discussion, unlike 
      a dormitory bull session, consists of student comments separated by frequent 
      probes and clarifications by the teacher that facilitate involvement and 
      development of thinking by the whole group. Dynamic lecturers captivate 
      a class by the virtuosity of their individual performances. Exemplary discussion 
      leaders accomplish the same end by skillful guidance of the group&#146;s 
      collective thinking processes.&quot; 159</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">According to this, leaders are there to lead, not to passively 
    listen.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">Also, &quot;Student comments are offered to the instructor 
        in the hope of approval and verification of their academic competence. 
        The quality of the instructor&#146;s response potently influences both 
        the student offering the comment and those observing the interchange.&quot; 
        165 When considering response options, remember the folowing:</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">As a discussion leader, you need to take your attention 
      off self, off your outline, and onto what people are saying. You need to 
      sparkle in your best personality, exuding friendliness, enthusiasm, intensity, 
      and good humor, all in proper balance.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">As the leader, your probes, comments, and summaries will 
      either urge the group on, creating excitement and participation, or will 
      dampen interest like a wet blanket. &quot;All successful discussion leaders 
      direct the group&#146;s thinking by following a series of student comments 
      with brief remarks or additional questions that build on students&#146; 
      comments.&quot; 166 [see exercise on summarizing] &quot;But if the teacher 
      speaks for more than 15 seconds between comments, it may turn off students' 
      motivation to speak up. Thus, make your summaries very brief, and avoid 
      launching into comments of your own unless you are ready to shift focus 
      or bring discussion to a close.&quot; 182</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="+1">1. Wait for at least two or three comments before changing 
        direction or moving discussion along with another query, or moving back 
        to lecture. On the other hand, students&#146; enthusiasm for responding 
        usually wanes after five of six comments and the instructor must then 
        exert leadership once again. [see Lowman, 182,3]</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">2. In general, the leader should be very positive in 
        response to any comments from members, but not always. The positive response 
        can be a challenge, especially when people aren&#146;t saying what you 
        hoped they would. People wonder whether to risk speaking up, and they 
        decide the question partly based on how the leader responds to others 
        who share. As the group wonders corporately how much to fear the instructor, 
        response to dumb points is more important than response to obviously brilliant 
        answers. You can usually find something positive to say even in wrong 
        responses. At times, you may elect to withhold positive response, but 
        this is unusual.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">3. At times, the leader needs to be provocative. Provocative 
        discussions in which assumptions are questioned require that instructors 
        become highly involved in the group&#146;s problem solving as gadflies 
        or devil&#146;s advocates, working to keep the group on its toes. &quot;So 
        you&#146;re saying that anyone who has a quiet time in the morning is 
        a formalist?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">4. At other times, the need for positive reinforcement 
        collides with the need to advance learning and truth. &quot;A discussion 
        leader who lets students talk on and on with little control or direction 
        will soon lose the group's attention.&quot; (165) </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">5. Responding to statements that are clearly untrue or 
        that take the discussion in a direction other than what you as leader 
        want, present a special challenge to our diplomacy and firmness. [see 
        exercise on responding to wrong answers] Several possible types of response 
        follow. What is being done in each? </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="+1">&quot;Yes, that&#146;s interesting. I wonder how you 
          would respond to someone who used a similar argument to justify infanticide?&quot; 
          &quot;Okay, what do the rest of us think about that?&quot;</font></p>
        <p> <font size="+1">&quot;Yeah, what about that?&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">&quot;Okay, that&#146;s very thought provoking, and 
          there are certainly a lot of people who would agree with that.&quot; 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">&quot;I don&#146;t think you&#146;re saying all morality 
          is relative to the individual, are you?&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">&quot;Okay, that squares with what Jim said. But <i>why 
          </i>would a person feel that way?&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">&quot;Would you say that&#146;s a biblical teaching, 
          or your personal opinion?&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">&quot;If I understood you correctly, Janice you are 
          saying that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">&quot;I realize what you&#146;re saying is important 
          in some contexts, but I&#146;d like to finish with the question I raised 
          earlier.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">&quot;The only problem I see with that is.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot; 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">&quot;Do you think what you are saying is compatible 
          with.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">&quot;How would you reconcile that with what you said 
          earlier?&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">&quot;Okay, great! But I wonder if we really ever addressed 
          the question I raised earlier?&quot; </font></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p> <font size="+1">6. Sometimes people will ask questions of the instructor 
      instead of giving opinion or answers. Lowman points out that students learn 
      most from struggling with a problem or issue, so you should not propose 
      a solution too quickly even if directly asked. The default response should 
      be, &quot;That&#146;s a good question. Who has an idea for an answer?&quot; 
      This kind of response turns the locus of expertise back from the leader 
      to the group. In some situations, however, it may be best to answer the 
      question yourself. What kind of questions do you think might better be handled 
      by the leader rather than turned back to the group?</font> </p>
    <p><font size="+1">7. During some spontaneous discussion, members may burst 
      into angry outbursts at other members or at the leader. When directed at 
      the leader, such outbursts present no particular danger to the group, as 
      the leader will no doubt be able to respond appropriately. However, when 
      newer members of the group are the object of attack, the leader must spring 
      into action. Even when older members are attacked, there is some danger 
      that they may retaliate inappropriately. The leader is responsible for mediating 
      such disputes, calling on either party or both for more self-control and 
      understanding. Remember:</font> </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="+1">The presence of anger is not a bad thing in group interaction 
          </font> </p>
        <p><font size="+1">A panicked response from the leader or other members 
          moving to quench the anger may do more harm than the anger itself. You 
          must be perceived as fair and undefensive in this situation. </font> 
        </p>
        <p><font size="+1">You may elect to speak a word of discipline to the 
          angry one. This may depend on the severity of the outburst, whether 
          it has been a repetitive problem, and the spiritual age and accountability 
          of the speaker. Samples might include: </font> </p>
        <p><font size="+1">&quot;Well, I think what you&#146;re saying may be 
          important for us to discuss, but I hope we can discuss it without losing 
          respect for each other&quot; </font> </p>
        <p><font size="+1">&quot;I see this upsets you quite a bit. Why do you 
          think that is?&quot; </font> </p>
        <p><font size="+1">Sometimes simply reflect feelings, &quot;You&#146;re 
          angry that a group of middle-class whites would presume to know that 
          Blacks think and feel.&quot; But follow up with a helpful suggestion. 
          </font> </p>
        <p><font size="+1">For an accountable believer, &quot;Why don&#146;t you 
          try to restate your question in a spirit of humility and love?&quot; 
          </font> </p>
        <p><font size="+1">&quot;Are you upset because.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot; [speculate 
          on what you think is the cause of their anger] </font> </p>

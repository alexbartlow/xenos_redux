<h2><font size="+1">Guiding Discussion Through Responses (Cont.)</font></h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">8. When someone shares a good point, we need_________________________________. 
    A leader who simply says &quot;that&#146;s a good point&quot; is not necessarily 
    advancing the discussion. Try to assess how to acknowledge and appreciate 
    the point, summarize the point, while at the same time deciding whether to 
    doing one of the following (this takes fast thinking on your feet): </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">_________________________________________________<br>
    <br>
    _________________________________________________<br>
    <br>
    _________________________________________________<br>

    _________________________________________________<br>

  <p><font size="+1"><br>
    9. The typical pattern for group lessons is a series of points made by the 
    leader, interspersed with periods of discussion. Breaking out of discussion 
    and back into lecture is usually very natural after fielding a comment: <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">10. If the group has skipped points, maybe say, <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">11. Don&#146;t assume new, unexpected directions are ______.

<h2><font size="+1">Ending Discussion<br>
  </font></h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">Don&#146;t wait until everyone is worn out and refuse to 
    talk. </font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">Keep your eye on the clock and end on time. Time passes faster 
    during discussion than under other formats. I</font><font size="+1">f people 
    are still discussing excitedly, you may delay a bit, but warn them that we 
    need to wrap it up soon. </font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">Ask &quot;Are there are any final thoughts before we tie 
    this all together?&quot; </font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">Then, give a short summary and final thought or challenge 
    before moving to prayer. </font> </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">Be sure to use some _________ for this part. </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">You may want to refer to a point or two made by others 
      earlier, naming them</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Consider thanking your group for their participation (but 
      this could also be done one-on-one afterward)</font></p>

      it will appear in students&#146; notes and will be remembered.</font> </p>

<h2><font size="+1"><b><font color="#CCFF33">Infusing energy into discussion</font> 
  </b></font></h2>
<ol>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">What makes a discussion exciting and energetic? </font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">1. Content</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font size="+1">- &quot;Content per minute&quot; has to be properly 
            paced. Too little content per minute makes people feel like they are 
            being patronized, as obvious points are repeated or belabored in an 
            unenlightening way. Too much content per minute leads to confusion. 
            We believe too much content is better than too little. We would rather 
            have people challenged than bored.</font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">- Content that is provocative, either of previous 
            assumptions, or of listeners' lifestyles, tends to be stimulating. 
            But use tact and care, because while insulting people may be interesting 
            and create feelings, we will not usually win the day this way.</font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">- Content that is new and unknown to listeners may 
            cause excitement, but only if we can show them why they would benefit 
            from learning something new, or why it is simply interesting. Also, 
            new content must be backed up with convincing evidence, because people 
            are more suspicious of new content.</font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">- Some content is simply not that interesting. Ask 
            yourself, &quot;Would I be interested in this subject if I wasn't 
            teaching?&quot; If not, you have to be creative enough to make it 
            interesting, or edit it out. Some truths are uninteresting because 
            they don't seem to apply or tie in with other knowledge. We have tried 
            to show you how to use thesis-antithesis thinking to make otherwise 
            dry content interesting. Likewise, strong illustrations, personal 
            sharing, and applying as you go can all make content interesting.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="+1"><br>
        2. Leader pathos -- Study the <a href="../homiletics/effectpreach.htm">outline 
        on authoritative speaking</a> In addition:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="+1">- Pathos is feeling. The truth is important and should 
          be served up with some feeling--otherwise we are sending mixed signals. 
          &quot;This is the most important truth in the world, but it doesn't 
          move me to raise my voice.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">- To create feeling, the speaker should actually feel. 
          When we let ourselves feel the urgency of our message, we are said to 
          have a &quot;burden&quot; for the material. We develop a burden through 
          prayer and wrestling with accusation and apathy during the days before 
          we teach. This is a good reason to avoid waiting until the day before 
          to prepare. Sometimes, our burden has to be taken on faith, in the sense 
          that we won't actually feel the zeal until we actually step up to speak.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">- Leader inhibition causes us to want to be &quot;cool&quot; 
          when teaching, and not risk being viewed as foolish. While extreme or 
          corny displays would be considered foolish, most of us are in NO DANGER 
          of suffering this fate! Video taping your teaching will confirm that 
          most of us are much more reserved and inhibited than we think.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">- Consider the components of strong emotional communication:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font size="+1">1. <b>_________</b> - emotion is noticeable in the 
            way we speak. An even, calm tone suggests a lack of emotion. Strong 
            emotional speech is variable -- The tone of our voice should rise 
            and fall in volume and in pitch. Also, emotional speech is generally 
            louder (unless expressing grief or similar). Try going extreme in 
            pitch and volume once in awhile on key points. Learn to throw the 
            hardball, but save it for ____________. Also, unusual ways of bending 
            words, speaking with staccato gaps, repetition of phrases, and exaggerated, 
            slow or fast speech all attract waning attention and arouse curiosity. 
            Again, the important thing is not to throw all hardballs, but to vary 
            our approach. Intense fury is most impacting when juxtaposed with 
            happiness, humor, appeals, or sorrow. Throwing any pitch too often 
            becomes either boring, or even annoying.</font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">2. <b>_________</b> - Research confirms that much 
            of what we communicate emotionally is transmitted through the face. 
            When teaching, especially a home church or cell, you are easily close 
            enough to people for them to get a good look at your face. Think about 
            people who are emotional. How does their emotional state affect their 
            faces? Faces that are screwed up in agony, faces with huge, happy 
            smiles, faces that are solicitous or sympathetic, faces that are disturbed 
            or suspicious, all help to convey strong pathos. A deadpan face suggest 
            lack of interest and perfunctory discussion, unmoved by the subject. 
            What a terrible mistake to communicate God's word that way!</font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">3. <b>__________________</b> - When people are emotional, 
            you can tell from their body language. Unemotional people are stationary, 
            calm, and relaxed. Emotional people become agitated and their body 
            movements become pronounced. The head may begin to bob or jerk with 
            our speech, punctuating phrases. The head may tilt to one side or 
            rear back, as if in refusal. Our hands may gesture furiously, including 
            broad sweeping movements when we are truly upset. Emotional people 
            may bang their fists on the table. They may lean closer to the listener. 
            They may become agitated enough to stand up and pace. They may point 
            their finger directly at the face of the listener. They may act out 
            with their arms what they are talking about. They may wrap their arms 
            around themselves protectively. The possibilities are endless and 
            should be matched appropriately to the situation. Again, wild gesturing 
            and movement can be exciting, but only if limited to key situations 
            and points. If we begin to act this way all the time, it becomes phony 
            and annoying.<br>
            <br>
            3. <b>______</b> - Regardless of what emotion we are communicating, 
            speech experts warn us that we must make direct eye-contact with our 
            hearers. Inexperienced speakers often tend to look down at their notes, 
            thus momentarily breaking the rapport they have established with their 
            hearers, and calling attention to the fact that this is a planned 
            teaching, rather than a spontaneous act of communication--exactly 
            what we <i>don't</i> want. Limit looking at your notes as much as 
            possible. Two or three times should be enough for a whole teaching, 
            because you are only checking to see if you left anything out. Inexperienced 
            speakers also tend to stare just over the heads of the audience, or 
            just below them at the floor. This helps the speaker to concentrate 
            without distraction, but either of these would earn an &quot;F&quot; 
            in speech class because they both suggest disengagement with the audience. 
            Instead, learn to slide your eyes across the audience from person 
            to person, looking ______________ ___________. </font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">4. <b>_____________________</b> - People are generally 
            stimulated when others chime in. People like to interact with their 
            peers and hear others' viewpoints, or ways of expressing the same 
            point. As discussion leaders, we are in a unique position to draw 
            on this avenue for pathos. As discussed earlier, when people begin 
            to discuss, learn to goad them on to further exertion. When someone 
            is emotional in their sharing or comments, be sure to encourage them. 
            </font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="+1">If your group is being fed with good content, and stimulated 
        by strong pathos, you have both ______ and _______. Such teachings have 
        the power to impact people in a lasting way.</font></p>

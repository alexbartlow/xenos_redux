      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Because some churches 
        feel the freedom to use Old Covenant material in their understanding of 
        the church, they have an inherent tendency to incorporate Old Covenant 
        structures into church life. Consider the following examples. </font></p>

        </font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Past Purpose</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">: 
        The tabernacle was a prophetic picture of God's intent to dwell in his 
        people; his presence dwelt in the building in a unique way. The symbolic 
        events conducted in the tabernacle explained why God could not indwell 
        his people (because of their sins) and how he would one day overcome this 
        problem (by making atonement for their sins through his chosen substitute). 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Present Error</b>: 
        Now this prophetic picture has been fulfilled. God dwells in every Christian 
        and in the church corporately; the church is the temple of God. (1 Cor. 
        3:16; Eph. 2:20-22; 1 Pet. 2:4,5) Thus, it is no longer proper to regard 
        any building as the place where God dwells in a special way. </font></p>

        </font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Possible Answers</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">: 
        Most people view the church as a building rather than the people indwelt 
        by God. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Many people superstitiously 
        believe the church building (or the sanctuary therein) is &quot;God's 
        house&quot; in that his presence is localized there more so than anywhere 
        else. For this reason, people often speak in hushed tones when entering 
        a sanctuary, even when no one else is there! Parents tell children not 
        to run or play in the sanctuary because &quot;this is God's house.&quot; 
        Not only does this suggest God is anti-fun; it also communicates that 
        God is still unable to indwell us personally as we come to him through 
        Christ. Priesthood </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Past Purpose</b>: 
        The high priest was a type of Christ. (Heb. 3:1; 4:14) For this reason, 
        he alone was permitted to enter into God's presence with a sacrifice for 
        the people's sins. The other priests were a type of Christians in that 
        they could draw near to God and communicate the knowledge of God to the 
        people. The rest of the people were essentially passive participants in 
        the service of God. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Present Error</b>: 
        This clergy-laity distinction which was valid in the Old Covenant period 
        is now invalid. Because of Jesus' sacrifice, all believers have equal 
        access to God and equal privilege to communicate the knowledge of God 
        to others. ((Heb. 10:19-22; 1 Pet. 2:9)</font></p>

        </font></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Possible 
        Answers</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">: 
        The effect of the clergy-laity distinction has usually been to discourage 
        unordained Christians from ministering in significant ways. Church members 
        often think it is the minister's job to reach out to others, teach the 
        Bible, give spiritual counsel, etc. With no significant ministry purpose 
        to pursue, many church members by default become enmeshed in materialism, 
        which offers a counterfeit significance. This is a tragic squandering 
        of the resources of the church.</font></p>
      <p><b><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="4" color="#990000">Sabbath

        </font></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Past 
        Purpose</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">: 
        God gave the Israelites a full calendar of &quot;holy&quot; days. The 
        Sabbath and the prescribed festivals were largely prophetic pictures of 
        the salvation which Jesus would accomplish. (Col. 2:16,17) every day is 
        holy in the sense that salvation has occurred once and for all. Paul makes 
        it clear in Rom. 14:1-5 that only those Christians who are &quot;weak 
        in faith&quot; ascribe intrinsic spiritual significance to the observance 
        of the Sabbath. In Gal. 4:1-11, he says that Christians who go back to

        The Old Covenant worship of God was highly ritualistic. This was because 
        it was designed to be an elaborate predictive picture of the work of Christ. 
        (Heb. 8:5) The content and order of this ritual observance was highly 
        regulated because it taught that we must come to God in the way he prescribed 
        - by faith in his Substitute.</font></p>

        Now that these pictures have been fulfilled, they are obsolete. (Heb. 
        8:13) Not only does the New Testament not describe or command a worship 
        service for the church; there is also a positive reinterpretation of this 
        whole concept (see section on &quot;Worship in the New Testament&quot;). 
        Also, the number of prescribed rituals has been drastically reduced (from 
        hundreds to two) and the regulation of how to observe them has been minimized.

        Those who subscribe to the necessity of liturgical worship invariably 
        communicate an impersonal relationship with God when the way is now open 
        to have an intensely personal relationship with him. Also, it is all too 
        easy to continue to observe ritual even when the reality of the relationship 
        is not there. This is why we have so many ritualistic churches today where 
        the members do not know God personally. This ritualism is a turn-off to 
        those who long for personal contact with God.</font></p>

    face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><br>
        </font>Past Purpose</b>: Infant circumcision was a ritual given by God 
        to Abraham and his physical descendents. (Gen. 17:9-14) Circumcision was 
        to be the sign that Israel was God's people. It was also a symbol of their 
        need to be liberated from the bondage of their sin- natures. (Deut. 10:16; 
        Jer. 4:4) God predicted that when Messiah came, he would &quot;circumcise 
        your heart . . . to love the Lord your God.&quot; (Deut. 30:6) </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Present Error</b>: 
        The symbolism of physical circumcision was fulfilled in the death of Christ 
        through which he disarmed the authority of our sin natures. (Col. 2:11) 
        In spite of the fact that all clear examples of baptism in the New Testament 
        are adult believers, many churches see infant baptism as the church's 
        counterpart to infant circumcision. Roman Catholic doctrine states that 
        it removes the guilt of original sin, thus teaching that spiritual regeneration 
        comes through baptism. Many Protestant denominations erroneously believe 
        that passages like Rom. 6:4 and Col. 2:11 refer to water baptism, and 
        thus almost seem to teach baptismal regeneration.</font></p>

        When asked if they will go to heaven, people commonly answer &quot;yes&quot; 
        because they were baptized as infants. Infant baptism has the effect of 
        de- emphasizing the necessity of personal conversion to Christ. Instead, 
        it communicates that salvation is something entered into on the basis 
        of parental decision or ritual observance. This is a formalistic definition 
        of Christianity which leads to whole churches full of nominal Christians 
        (in name only). </font></p>

        The Old Testament law code was a national contract with Israel which stipulated 
        the conditions by which they could enjoy the land of Canaan. (see Deut. 
        28) It also had a spiritual value in that it showed them their need for 
        God's grace which would be given when Messiah came. (Gal. 3:22-25) For 
        both of these reasons, it was entirely proper for Israel to have a &quot;law 
        emphasis.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Present Error</b>: 
        The church is not a national entity living in Canaan, but an international

        ministries of the Holy Spirit, making it possible for us to serve &quot;in 
        the newness of the Spirit rather than the oldness of the letter.&quot; 
        (Rom. 7:6) The emphasis of the church should therefore be on the good 
        news of God's grace, not on the Law and the threat of God's judgment.

        a way to forever escape his judgment. Some respond to this emphasis by 
        running from God altogether; others become self-righteous. In either case, 
        the unchurched person does not get the impression that Christianity is 
        about the grace of God. </font></p>

        God's strategy for reaching Gentiles in the Old Testament period was centripetal. 
        As the Israelites stayed in the land and followed the Law, God granted 
        them national security and material prosperity. Foreigners would notice 
        this, and some would thus adopt YHWH as their God. (Deut. 28:7-14; 1 Kings 
        10:1-12) The main reason for this &quot;stay in the land&quot; strategy 
        was that the Holy Spirit was not operative in the same way he is today, 
        so the Israelites needed to be a separate culture to prevent complete 
        apostasy. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Present Error</b>: 
        Since the coming of the Holy Spirit, the God's outreach strategy has changed 
        from centripetal (&quot;stay in the land&quot;) to centrifugal (&quot;go 
        into all the world&quot; - see Mt. 28:18; Acts 1:8). God's people are 
        no longer to be a distinct culture, but rather are commanded identify 
        culturally with those that they seek to reach (1 Cor. 9:19-23). Also, 
        whereas material blessing was at times a legitimate national indication 
        of Israel's obedience to God (although see Deut. 8:11-14;31:20; Prov. 
        30:8,9; Neh. 9:25.26; Hos. 13:6), this is not the case in the church (see

        Many churches also have developed their own sub-culture which effectively

        In the Old Testament the nation of Israel was both a spiritual and national 
        entity. The government of Israel was originally a theocracy, eventually 
        replaced by a theocratic-chosen king. God needed a nation where he could 
        preserve the witness he was accumulating about himself. It was entirely 
        in order for God to call on the government of ancient Israel to operate 
        the nation in a just and godly way. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Present Error</b>: 
        In the New Testament, the church is not expected to function as a nation 
        state. On the contrary, the program is clearly different as witnessed 
        by the call to submit to, and obey the Roman government--one of the most 
        godless and brutal governments in history. (Rom. 13:1) The New Testament 
        is devoid of any call to take over society or to run society God's way. 
        Unfortunately, many Bible interpreters continue to read the Covenantal 
        promises and warnings addressed to Israel in the Old Testament as though 
        they apply either to the church, or to the United States (or other countries). 
        <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A very common example 
        of this confusion is the often quoted passage in 2 Chronicles 7:13 &quot;If 
        I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust 
        to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among My people, and My people 
        who are called by My name humble themselves and pray, and seek My face 
        and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, will forgive 
        their sin, and will heal their land.&quot; It is a mistake to apply this 
        passage to the United States? It refers to the cursing/blessing section 
        in the book of Deuteronomy. The people who are called by God's name are 
        Israel. There is in fact no such promise extended to other countries.

      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One qualification 
        is needed on this point. In the ancient world, there was no opportunity 
        to vote on government issues or candidates. We do not know what God would 
        have said if there was. Probably, a good ethical case can be made for 
        Christian activism in politics as long as it falls short of attempts to 
        establish a Christian state. </font></p>

        History is full of examples of catastrophic results when the church has 
        concluded that it is to run the state. A nation state often has to operate 
        in the area of compulsion, punishment and even war. All of these things 
        are inappropriate for the church. The church needs to keep crystal clear 
        loyalties, excluding any non-biblical insertion into Christian doctrine. 
        <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Manipulators use 
        values similar or even identical to those in the Bible to get Christians 
        to back their agendas. For instance, no two themes are more universal 
        in world religions than the sanctity of the family and the sacredness 
        of the given cultural-national heritage. Oriental religion often actually 
        worships parents and ancestors. Islam views the state as expressly a religious 
        entity. Most oral religions are one and the same as the government of 
        the tribe. This has tended to be true of Christianity as well in Europe. 
        The medieval church was convinced that the state was to operate under 
        the spiritual authority of the church. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Linking the universal 
        appeal of blood and soil values with patriotic values and religion leads 
        to the formation of a civil religion which is sometimes only nominally 
        Christian. For instance, the implication of a prominent evangelical leading 
        whole football stadiums in prayer before games is clear- -all or most 
        of those present must be Christians. It is easy to see why people begin 
        to believe that Christianity is synonymous with American citizenship or 
        church membership. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This nominal Christianity 
        is one of the most deadly threats to real Christianity for two reasons. 
        In the first place, it causes people to believe that they are Christians 
        when they are not, and secondly, it misrepresents Christianity to the 
        secular world. Instead of seeing real vibrant spiritual living on the 
        part of the church, society sees a Christianity that is plagued by confusion 
        and mediocrity. <br>

      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Francis Schaeffer

        statement mean, and do you agree with it? What absolute should judge the

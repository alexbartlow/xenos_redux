    face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Introduction<br>
        </font></b>It is common for churches to say that their <b>first priority 
        is the worship of God</b>. This usually means that the corporate worship 
        service on Sunday morning is the most important activity in which the 
        church engages. Often, that worship service is <b>liturgical</b>--characterized 
        by a set order of ritual, song, prayer, etc. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Is this what the 
        New Testament teaches about worship?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A closer examination 
        of the relevant biblical material affirms that worship is indeed the first 
        priority of the church, but the New Testament defines worship in a very 
        different way.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><font
    face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A Change in Sacrifices<br>
        <a name="sacrifice"></a> </font>Read 1 Peter 2:5</b>. This verse (along 
        with vs. 9) teaches that all Christians are priests. Whereas in the Old 
        Testament, only select Levites had this privilege, every Christian now 
        has this privilege.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>What do priests 
        do?<br>
        </b>In the Old Testament period, their main function was to carry out 
        the worship of God through the offering of sacrifices. There were essentially 
        two different kinds of sacrifices: sin offerings, which were offered for 
        moral offenses, and thank offerings, which were offered to express gratitude 
        for God's goodness and blessing. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The New Testament 
        tells us that Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament sin offerings through 
        his death (Hebrews 9:11-14; 10:1-14); therefore, we need never make such 
        sacrifices to God again. But as Christians who have benefited from his 
        sacrifice, we have the privilege to express our gratitude to God for Christ's 
        work in many ways. Peter refers to this in 1 Peter 2:5 when he says that 
        we &quot;offer up spiritual sacrifices to God.&quot; Peter does not specify 
        here what these sacrifices are, except that they are spiritual, not physical. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By studying other 
        passages in the New Testament, however, we discover several different 
        &quot;sacrifices&quot; by which the Christian may worship God. It is important 
        to note that no one way is viewed as more spiritual than the others; all 
        are important if we want to have full-orbed spiritual lives. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Ask the Group<br>
        </b>Do you think we can go so far as to say that churches who practice 
        a liturgy are wrong on that point? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><font
    face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Different Ways to Worship<br>
        <a name="worship"></a> </font>Offer God Your Whole Self:<br>
        </b>&quot;I urge you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present 
        your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, well-pleasing to God, which is 
        your spiritual service of worship.&quot; (Romans 12:1)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When an Israelite 
        had received a blessing from God, he could have a priest offer up an animal 
        as a &quot;whole burnt offering&quot; to show God his gratitude. God was 
        pleased by this costly sacrifice, and expressed this by calling it a &quot;soothing 
        aroma.&quot; (see Leviticus 3:5,16) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Paul says that as 
        Christians, we have received the mercies of God through Christ's work 
        - a gift so fantastic that he spent the previous eleven chapters of this 
        letter describing it. How can we say &quot;Thank you!&quot; to God for 
        such a fantastic gift? Not by offering an animal, but by presenting to 
        God something much more precious--our very selves. We can &quot;sign over 
        the title deed&quot; of our lives and say &quot;God, I want the rest of 
        my life and every part of my being to be one long expression of my gratitude 
        for the gift that you have given me.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We may think that 
        this sacrifice is not very great because we have so many problems and 
        faults, but God says that it is &quot;holy&quot; and &quot;well-pleasing&quot; 
        to him! Notice that according to Paul, this sacrifice is our &quot;spiritual 
        service of worship.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The Greek word for 
        &quot;service of worship&quot; is the word from which we get the term 
        liturgy. Paul is saying that the elaborate worship service enacted by 
        the Old Testament priests no longer has a place in Christian worship; 
        it is now replaced by this very personal sacrifice. </font></p>

        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dt><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Here is another 
          spiritual sacrifice which pleases God--praising him and thanking him 
          for all that he is and all that he does for us. The practice of thankfulness 
          to God is stressed over and over again in the New Testament (see 1 Thessalonians 
          5:16-18; Colossians 3:15-17). Why is this? Does God need our gratitude 
          so that he can feel good about himself? </font></dt>
        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dt><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Such a view obviously 
          does not befit the God of the Bible--he is the only being in the universe 
          who is completely self-existent and therefore needs nothing. We add 
          nothing to God by praising and thanking him. God is indeed pleased by 
          our gratitude, but the ones who benefit from this practice are us! </font></dt>
        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dt><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As we choose (often 
          against our present feelings and circumstances) to recall God's blessings 
          and then to thank him for these, we are keeping ourselves properly aligned 
          with reality. Rather than buying into the lie that we are mistreated 
          and unfortunate, we are by faith asserting the truth--that we are fantastically 
          blessed beyond anything that we could ever deserve! In spite of our 
          rebellion against God which deserves his wrath, he has forgiven us, 
          adopted us into his family, guaranteed us eternal life, given us a significant 
          role in his purpose, indwelt us with his Spirit, provided us with Christian 
          friends-- and the list goes on and on.</font> </dt>

        <dt><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The author's emphasis 
          here is that we should worship God in this way &quot;continually.&quot; 
          The idea that Christian worship takes place only (or especially) in 
          a corporate worship meeting is utterly foreign to this verse. Because 
          of Christ's payment for our sins, we have the privilege to draw near 
          to God and communicate to him in this way at any time: in the morning 
          when we wake up, on the way to work, during the busy day, when we are 
          together with other Christians, alone in our room, etc. </font></dt>
        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dt><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It is wonderful 
          to praise God with other Christians in song (Ephesians 5:19), but this 
          should be only the &quot;tip of the iceberg&quot; of our thanks to God.

        <dt><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The author touches 
          on two more ways in which we can worship God: doing good and sharing. 
          &quot;Sharing&quot; probably refers to the generous giving of our material 
          resources to God's people and God's work. This is explicitly identified 
          by Paul as a sacrifice which pleases God: &quot;But I have received 
          (your money gift) in full, and have an abundance; I am amply supplied, 
          having received from Epaphroditus what you have sent, a fragrant aroma, 
          an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.&quot; (Phillipians 4:18)</font> 
        </dt>
        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dt><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Many Christians 
          regard giving financially to God in the same way that they pay their 
          taxes to the I.R.S. - they have to do it, and they look for ways to 
          give as little as possible. Paul's view is very different from this. 
          He says that giving is a privilege (2 Corinthians 8:4) and something 
          that we should do generously (2 Corinthians 9:6), as an expression of 
          our commitment to God (2 Corinthians 8:5).</font> </dt>
        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dt><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When we give our 
          money to God in this way by supporting our local church, other Christian 
          workers and ministries, and helping the needy, God regards this as an 
          expression of worship fully as spiritual as praising him. This is because 
          giving of our money represents a giving of ourselves, since money represents 
          the time and effort and creativity that we have invested in order to 
          gain it. Such giving is also an expression of our trust in God's faithfulness 
          to continue to meet our material needs--which Paul tells us God will 
          fully supply (Phillipians 4:19). </font></dt>

          </b>How can a Christian make the transition in his or her thinking from 
          the &quot;I.R.S.&quot; outlook on giving to the &quot;privilege&quot;

        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dt><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The other sacrifice 
          mentioned in this verse is &quot;doing good.&quot; This phrase refers 
          to ministry--performing deeds of loving service to other people as representatives 
          of Christ. When we relate to the people God brings into our lives with 
          Christ-like, sacrificial love, God regards this as an expression of 
          our worship to him. &quot; . . . walk in love, just as Christ loved 
          you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice as a fragrant 
          aroma.&quot; </font></dt>
        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dt><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">God is pleased 
          by this kind of life-style not only because he wants to love people 
          through us, but also because this demonstrates that we are living with 
          an attitude of trust in his love for us. We are motivated to love others 
          because we understand and believe in the love that God has for us (1 
          John 4:16-19). </font></dt>
        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dt><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Every day, God 
          gives us dozens of creative opportunities to say &quot;thank you!&quot; 
          to him in this way-- serving our spouses, caring for our children, performing 
          deeds of service for those in need, showing and sharing the love of 
          Christ to our neighbors, those at work or school--the examples are endless. 
          </font></dt>
        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dt><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We also have the 
          special privilege of worshiping God through the exercise of our spiritual 
          gifts. Paul speaks of his own apostolic ministry in this way: &quot; 
          . . . because of the grace that was given to me from God, to be a minister 
          of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering as a priest the gospel 
          of God, that my offering of the Gentiles might become acceptable, sanctified 
          by the Holy Spirit.&quot; (Romans 15:15,16) </font></dt>
        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dt><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">After urging us 
          to present our lives to God as an act of worship in Romans 12:1, Paul 
          goes on to urge us to express that worship through the use of our spiritual 
          gifts (vs. 6-8). As we discover our spiritual gifts and exercise them 
          regularly in the service of others, and give God praise for the fruit 
          of this ministry, we discover a form of worship that is uniquely satisfying!

        </font></b>It should be clear from this study that worship in the New

        necessarily a corporate meeting.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Why is this so 
        important? </b>When Christians view worship as the most important priority 
        (which is correct) but have a superficial view of what worship is, the 
        result is often a superficial and dichotomized Christian life. Such Christians 
        are faithfully committed to attending the Sunday worship service, but 
        because they view that as the essence of worship, fail to develop a lifestyle 
        of whole- hearted commitment to God, thankfulness, financial stewardship 
        and ministry. God is more pleased and we are more fulfilled when we develop 
        lifestyles characterized by the full-orbed worship described in the New 
        Testament.</font></p>

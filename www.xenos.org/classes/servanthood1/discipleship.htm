      <h4><b>The biblical case for discipleship</b></h4>
      <b> </b> 
      <h4>The case is established both by precept and principle. We are using 
          this term, &quot;discipleship&quot; in a way different than the bible 
          uses it. The bible does not talk about workers having disciples, but 
          rather people being disciples of Christ. It doesn&#146;t make it wrong 
          for us to use it referring to people we are discipling, but we are on 
      safer ground just demonstrating the work of discipleship.</h4>
      <dir> 
      <h4>Jesus&#146; example: Mark 3:13-15 (Coleman). We see Christ being 
      with them and sending them out.</h4>
      <h4>Jesus&#146; command: Matthew 28:19-20 &#150; we are teaching others 
            to be disciples of CHRIST, not us. Teaching them to observe what Christ 
      teaches, not us. The central imperative is &quot;make disciples&quot;.</h4>
      <h4>Paul&#146;s example: Colossians 1:28,29; 1 Timothy. 1:2 &amp; 2 
            Timothy 1:2; Titus 1:4 (30 other disciples mentioned) We could probably 
            argue that this is most important ministry (note the strong language 
            in Col. 1). Note also the language he uses to describe Timothy &#150; 
        &quot;beloved son&quot; does not likely mean he led Timothy to Christ, 
      but that he trained or mentored him. Likewise also with Titus.</h4>
      <h4>Paul&#146;s command: 2 Timothy 2:2</h4>
      </dir>
      <h4><b>Why is this so important?</b></h4>
      <dir><b> </b> 
      <h4>There were two great preachers in England in the 1800&#146;s. John 
            Wesley and George Whitefield. One was a greater speaker and had a 
      greater ability to reach the multitudes - Whitefield. </h4>
      <h4>However, Wesley had the greater long-term impact. Why? Discipleship. 
            He was committed to discipling the people he led to Christ so that 
            they would be able to do the same. This led Whitefield to say toward 
      the end of his career that he had woven a &quot;rope of sand&quot;.</h4>
      <h4>We see quality over quantity, core over crowd, cell over program. 
      Yet it leads to far greater quantity.</h4>
      <h4>In other words, we are comparing addition versus multiplication 
            growth. One person reaching 100 people for Christ every year but not 
            teaching them how to do the same, versus one person reaching one person 
      for Christ every other year, but also discipling them to do the same.</h4>
      <dir> 
      <h4>In 50 years, the 1<sup>st</sup> has reached 5,000 people for Christ. 
      And, his outreach ministry ends when he dies.</h4>
      <h4>In the same 50 years, the 2<sup>nd</sup> has effectively reached 
      16,777,216 people.</h4>
      <h4>QUALIFICATION: We are NOT saying that this exact progression will 
              or should be seen &#150; the evil one would have a hay-day with 
              that interpretation and has in our church. But the biblical principle 
              is essential to the church&#146;s health and growth nonetheless 
              and is explosive. The church must also be involved in cross-cultural 
      work that will not be as easy, rendering the calculated model inaccurate.</h4>

            Jesus discipled people in the context of a community, and healthy

            and focused investment. When a group relies only on the influence 
            of general ministry to get the job done, willing people don't develop 
            as quickly as they could. "Everyone's job is no one's job." So we 
            need to initiate interactions that are specifically designed to help 
            them develop. There are many variables that require us to be flexible 
      in how we spend this time. </h4>
      <dir> 
      <h4>Some of us make our main contribution in cell groups by what we 
              teach and how we interact with them before and afterward. We need 
              to resist the notion that if the people in our cell groups are in 
              Christian Principles, they are getting what they need. They need 
              repetition and depth in their biblical knowledge, and they need 
              personal models and input. Cell groups are a unique opportunity 
      for this.</h4>
      <h4>Many of us will supplement this with a regular additional time 
              with one or two folks who are particularly eager and promising. 
              We will spend this time focusing on what they seem to need at the 
              time--sometimes additional study, sometimes helping them face and 
              resolve sin-problems in their own lives, sometimes coaching them 
              in their developing ministries with others. Over a period of time, 
              we will want to address all of these areas, and we will always (in 
      my opinion) include prayer with them.</h4>

      <h4>We've been committed to personal discipleship in Xenos for many years, 
          and we've benefited greatly from it. We've also made many mistakes in 
          this area, and we need to be sure that we learn from our mistakes. Here 
      are the ones that come to my mind.</h4>
      <dir> 
      <h4><i>"I've got to get a disciple right now.&quot; </i>This sometimes 
            happens in home groups that strongly emphasize discipleship. Getting 
            a person becomes a hoop to jump through so we can say we are discipling 
            someone. We grab a person and try to force-feed them, rather than 
            prayerfully finding someone who wants to learn what we're suited to 
      teach them.</h4>
      <h4><i>"I am totally responsible for the growth of my disciples." </i>This 
            is another form of legalism, and it leads to excessive force, manipulation, 
            overstepping our bounds (DATING RESTRICTIONS; SIGNING IN &amp; OUT 
            OF MINISTRY HOUSES; etc.)--and ultimately to failure and discouragement. 
            We had a lot of this in the early 1980's, and we're still living it 
            down (DEN'S RECENT REPORTS). Let's stay away from this, and give people 
      the freedom to make decisions!</h4>
      <h4><i>"Stay away from my disciple." </i>(TERRITORIALITY) There have 
            been cases where disciplers have gotten very possessive of disciples 
            to the point of fighting over disciples - fighting over who gets to 
            disciple a new convert, keeping other disciplers away from &quot;my&quot; 
        disciple; people trying to &quot;take over&quot; another person&#146;s 
            disciple, etc. Coleman&#146;s use of the example of Christ breaks 
            down here because we are not sufficient as he is, nor do we have his 
            authority. Ultimately, they are not my disciples at all--they are 
            Jesus'. I am only assisting them by helping them learn how to follow 
            and obey him. The goal is not for me to hoard disciples, but to develop 
            younger Christians. That means I will not only be glad that they get 
            quality input from other workers, but I will also deliberately expose 
      them to other quality workers.</h4>
      <h4><i>"I've got to be able to raise up leaders as effectively as so-and-so." 
        </i>(COMPARISON) This is a very common form of legalism for all areas 
            of ministry, and it provides a fertile soil for accusation. Learn 
            the lesson of "NO LITTLE PEOPLE!" Do your work under grace, as unto 
            the Lord, trusting him for results--and be content that you are pleasing 
      him.</h4>
      <h4><i>"I've got to disciple others in exactly the same way so-and-so 
            does."</i> OR <i>&quot;People I disciple need to turn out to be just 
            like me.&quot; </i> (Illustration: brick layer vs. stone mason) Proper 
            uniformity = &quot;Every mature Christian should be involved in discipleship 
      and just about every disciple could eventually help lead a home group.&quot;</h4>
      <h4><i>"I can't be effective because I was never discipled one-on-one 
            by a mature worker." </i>Being discipled by a proven discipler is 
            an advantage. This is why you should pursue being discipled if you 
            can. But you can learn how to disciple others even if you didn&#146;t 
            receive textbook discipling. However, don&#146;t use this as an excuse 
            to avoid sacrificially investing in the life of younger believers 
      to help them grow.</h4>
      <h4><i>"Everyone in our home group should have one-on-one discipleship 
            time if they want it."</i> This monopolizes workers' time and eventually 
            burns them out. It also takes them away from ministering in their 
            gifted areas, and gets them focused equally on hungry and unhungry 
      people.</h4>
      <h4><i>"I'm not a leader/gifted at/mature enough to disciple, so I needn't 
            be involved in it." </i>Some of us are more gifted at this than others--especially 
            in leadership duplication. But the definition of discipleship we're 
            using now is broad enough for all of us to participate, and we agreed 
      to do this when we signed the Servant Covenant. </h4>
      <h4><i>"If our people are going to classes and serving in ministry team 
            roles, that's all they need." </i>This is the program-based fallacy 
            that leads to a superficial workforce. They need repetition and depth 
            in biblical content beyond what the classes can give them. They need 
            personal models and input that classes and ministry team roles cannot 
            give them. They need to develop foundational ministry skills that 
            are best developed in a home group/discipleship context (outreach; 
            body-life; developing spiritual gifts). I worry that many people in 
            Xenos these days view "ministry involvement" primarily in terms of 
            having a titled role (EXAMPLES) rather than developing these areas. 
            The point is no that titled roles are bad; it is that these are more 
      important. </h4>
      <h4><i>"No one is interested in being discipled." </i>This may be true 
            in your present situation. If so, are you praying for someone who 
            is? But it may not be true--you may be too negative. Pray that God 
      open your eyes to see the willing hearts!</h4>

              &quot;I&#146;m feeding them.&quot; Although their ministering to 
              others may well come up, your main purpose is in giving nurture, 
              counsel, admonition, biblical instruction to help them get established 
              in their walks with God. Discipleship, however, emphasizes<i> </i>their 
              now <i>ministering to others</i>. &quot;I&#146;m teaching them to 
              feed others also.&quot; Personal growth issues are addressed, but 
            the main focus is on how to become an effective Christian worker.</h4>

      <ul>
        <ul>
          <li> 
            <h4>Shepherding is <i>unconditional</i> &#150; we do it freely and 
              with no expectations of a reciprocal response. Discipleship, however, 
              is <i>conditional. </i>Do they really want to be a worker? We should 
              ask them if they want to get together so that you can help them 
              grow, if shepherding is the goal. If they take more interest in 
              the things of God, and you&#146;d like to help disciple them, you 
              should ask if they would like to get together more frequently so 
              that you can help them learn how to be used by God. The transition 
              from shepherding to discipleship is gradual. But if you move into 
              a discipleship relationship, you should make it clear there will 
              be expectations and accountability, and spell them out. Be willing 
              to step back if they won't do their part--but still love them as 
              before. This is important both for the work of discipleship and 
            to avoid "bait and switch" relationships.</h4>

              and for a period of time</i>. You meet with the person on a regular 
              basis with the understanding that the day will come when they will 
              be doing this with others. This doesn&#146;t imply that you spell 
              this desire out early in the relationship, nor at the point where 
              they are now investing in others that you stop getting together

          disciple them. Instead, shepherd them in love and <i>prayerfully</i> 
        watch their lives. Without being perfectionistic, prayerfully consider 
      the following questions:</h4>

          <li> 
            <h4><i>Do they ask spiritual questions and respond to good answers?</i> 
              This demonstrates genuine interest. Or do they only seem want to 
              spend time with you without expressing real interest in spiritual 
            things? </h4>
          </li>
          <li> 
            <h4><i>Do they take initiative in ministering to others?</i> Demonstrates 
              an ability to get outside of themselves. Or do they always have 
              to be asked to serve? Are they interested in people, forming relationships 
            with people in the group, etc.?</h4>

              and directly from God)?</i> Or do they always have to be corrected 
            by people, agree but don't act, etc.?</h4>
          </li>
          <li> 
            <h4><i>Do they take challenging steps of faith? </i>They are demonstrating 
              that their relationship with God, and his promises, is real to them 
              and impacts their lives. (EXAMPLES: financial giving; confessing 
              sin; witnessing; confronting)? Or do they usually stay in their 
            comfort zone?</h4>

      hobbies you like, etc.)</h4>

              issues to discuss. EXAMPLES: advice about people they're witnessing 
              to, following up with new people, discipling others, talking about

              relationship, etc. This teaches the importance of prayer in ministry,

              in marriage, ministry, etc., address them. If you aren't willing 
              to do this, you won't succeed. There should be mutual freedom to 
              bring up these kinds of issues. Often this is a more frequent topic 
              earlier in the relationship and as they mature, and become more 
              involved in ministry, less so. But it should not be a weekly topic; 
              we should be responsive as issues emerge. Overall, you&#146;d like 
              them to understand where their besetting sins are and help them 
              develop a strategy to lean against them. This is a process; don&#146;t

              Have a study plan. Getting into biblical content together regularly is important for both ministry equipping and mutual edification.  The biblical content may vary according to the need and maturity of those involved&mdash;e.g., reading and discussing a book of the Bible, doing an inductive study, reading and discussing a quality Christian book, going over class material, etc.  While your time together should not be study only (see above), don't let this key part get crowded out.  With younger Christians, it is particularly important to study with them regularly, and to help them prepare any teachings they are giving. Examples:<br>
              &bull;         Daily Bible reading plan<br>
              &bull;         Read and discuss your way through a biblical book<br>
              &bull;         Overview whole biblical books<br>
              &bull;         Read and discuss solid Christian books<br>
              &bull;         Review class material, or take a class together and discuss it afterward<br>

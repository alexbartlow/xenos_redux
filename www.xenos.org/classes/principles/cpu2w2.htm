<h3><strong><font face="Arial" size="3">Introduction</font></strong></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Many churches/Christians<b> </b>affirm 
    that we are justified by grace apart from works, but they then teach or imply 
    that we are sanctified by law through works--that as Christians we have the 
    ability and the obligation to live the Christian life by our own resources. 
    According to this view, if you don't grow, it is because you don't want to 
    grow or because you didn't try hard enough. Others may be very passive and 
    take no role in pursuing sanctification through faith. But Paul insists that 
    sanctification, just like justification, is given to us by God's grace and 
    received simply by faith. Therefore balance is needed as we consider God's 
    role and our role. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Some of the Galatians evidently felt 
    that while they were justified by grace through faith, they now had to get 
    sanctified by self-effort. Paul is horrified by this development! </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <font SIZE="2"><p><b>(Gal.&nbsp;3:2, 3)</b> This is the only thing I want to find out from
    you: did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith? Are you
    so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?</p></font>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The way we received Christ = the way 
    we are to walk in him. Since we know that we are justified by grace through 
    faith (Gal. 2:16), we are also sanctified by grace through faith. </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <font SIZE="2"><p><b>(Col.&nbsp;2:6,7)</b> As you therefore have received Christ Jesus the
    Lord, so walk in Him, (7) having been firmly rooted and now being built up in Him and
    established in your faith,</p></font>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This raises the important question: What does
  biblical faith look like? </font></p>
</blockquote>

<h3><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><a NAME="define"></a>Definition of Biblical 
  Faith</font></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Biblical faith is a willingness to 
    <i>act</i> according to God's truth with <i>dependence</i> on him to perform 
    it for/through us. As we go through the passages tonight, you'll see there 
    is ample biblical basis for this definition. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Greek word <i>pisteuo</i> is translated 
    as believe and faith. It has a clear connotation of personal trust. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Illustration:</strong> </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A tight-rope walker strung a wire 
        across the Niagara Falls as a crowd gathered on both sides of the falls. 
        First, he walked across using a balancing pole. Next, he walked back across 
        with the pole. Then he wheeled a wheel-barrow across. On the other side, 
        he shoveled 150 pounds of dirt and rock into the wheel-barrow and wheeled 
        it back across the falls. The crowd's applause was louder than the roar 
        of the falls! The man asked the crowd, &quot;Who believes that I can wheel 
        a man across the falls?&quot; Everyone shouted their affirmation. Then 
        he asked, &quot;Who's going to get in the wheel-barrow?&quot; The crowd 
        dispersed immediately. The crowd had a certain kind of faith--mental assent. 
        They intellectually agreed that the man was capable of wheeling a person 
        across the falls. But they did not have another kind of faith--personal 
        trust--because no one was willing to get in the wheel-barrow and entrust 
        their lives to his expertise. Such a step would involve a definite <i>action</i>, 
        but it would also involve genuine dependence on the tight-rope walker. 
        </font></p>

        Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow

      straight-forward commands (eg &quot;Love one another&#133;&quot;). Sometimes 
      imperatives are implied as examples (eg. Paul says &quot;&#133;imitate me

<h3><strong><font face="Arial" size="3">Conclusion</font></strong></h3>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Christians tend to be in a perpetual 
    state of flux in their understanding of God's responsibility and our responsibility 
    </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(Illus: Like a pendulum that 
    constantly swings, passing through it's state of equilibrium. The goal for 
    the Christian is that these swings become less extreme, and the time in equilibrium 
    gradually increases). When we note (or a Christian point it out to us) that 
    we are to one extreme or the other, we should correct it by emphasizing the 
    complementary truth. Helping other Christians do this is an important aspect 
    of ministry. This growing understanding is a part of sanctification. </font></p>

<h3><strong><font size="3"><a NAME="a1"></a></font>Introduction</strong></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Tonight we want to take a more thorough look at Old Testament prophecy. First, 
    we will study an important phenomenon in Old Testament prophecy (double reference). 
    Then we will study Daniel's prophetic visions, which illustrate the double 
    reference phenomenon and provide a prophetic framework for God's future dealings 
    with Israel. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong><font size="3"><a NAME="a2"></a></font>Double Reference in Biblical 
  Prophecy</strong></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>There are a number of prophecies in the Old Testament which have a primary 
    application to the millennial kingdom or the eternal kingdom, but are fulfilled 
    in part in the church age. Furthermore, there are prophecies which seem to 
    focus on the immediate historical context of the prophet, yet there is a more 
    complete fulfillment later. This tendency to speak of events that are separated 
    by time as though they were not separated is called the principle of <strong>double 
    reference</strong>. </p>
  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>(<strong>J. Dwight Pentecost</strong>) &quot;<strong>Two events, widely 
      separated as to the time of their fulfillment, may be brought together into 
      the scope of one prophecy</strong>. This was done because the prophet had 
      a message for his own day as well as for a future time&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It 
      was the purpose of God to give the near and far view so that the fulfillment 
      of the one should be the assurance of the fulfillment of the other.&quot; 
      (J. Dwight Pentecost, <i>Things To Come</i> [Grand Rapids: Zondervan Publishing 
      House, 1964], pp.&nbsp;46,47.)</p>
    <p><strong>The phenomenon of double reference prophecy to reveal God's plan 
      is common in and unique to the Bible.</strong> The Old Testament employs 
      four different kinds of double-reference prophecy: Type, Gap, Type-gap, 
      and Unforeseen partial.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Type</h3>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><strong>The Old Testament prophet describes an event, person, or institution 
        (&quot;type&quot;) and later Scripture reveals the prophetic significance 
        of this event, person, or institution (&quot;anti-type&quot;).</strong> 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>This subsequent event usually pertains to Christ or the events surrounding 
        one of his comings. Typology is also present in many Old Testament rituals.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Typological interpretation is different than allegorical interpretation, 
        because there must be some explicit scriptural basis for identifying the 
        type and anti-type. </p>
      <p>Note to the instructor: &quot;Type&quot; is the English translation of 
        the Greek word <i>parabolay, </i>which means <i>a placing beside </i>or 
        <i>comparison</i>. A type forshadows the antitype - a future event or 
        person that is similar to the type. &quot;Antitype&quot; comes from the 
        Greek word <i>antitupon, </i>which is literally <i>to be struck back</i> 
        or <i>to correspond to</i>. Think of an antitype as a mold, and the type 
        as the thing being molded.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong><b> </b>Num. 21:9 (see Jn. 3:14,15);&nbsp;Gen. 
      6; </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="2"><b>(Num. 21:8,9)</b> The LORD said to Moses, &quot;Make 
        a snake and put it up on a pole; anyone who is bitten can look at it and 
        live.&quot; (9) So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. 
        Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, 
        he lived.</font></p>
      <p>In Num. 21:9, God predicts to Moses that if anyone looks to the brazen 
        serpent Moses lifts up, they will be healed from the serpents' venomous 
        bite.</p>
      <p><strong>Fulfillment:</strong>&nbsp; Jesus declares that this event foreshadowed 
        him being lifted up (on the cross) so that whoever believes in him may 
        be forgiven. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2"><b>(Jn.&nbsp;3:14,15)</b> Just as Moses lifted up the 
          snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, (15) that 
          everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>Additional Examples: </b></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Gen. 6: Noah's rescue from the flood through the Ark foreshadowed believers' 
        rescue from God's judgment through &quot;baptism&quot; into Christ (1 
        Pet. 3). </p>
      <p>Old Testament atonement rituals (see Heb. 8-10); Dan. 8:17-26; Jer. 31:15 
        (see Mt. 2:17,18) </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Definition: </strong></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><strong><font size="3">The prophet predicts two dissimilar events, widely

        It should be noticed in this case that the predictive material referring

        the time gap usually relate to the two comings of the Messiah, of which 
        the Old Testament prophets were unaware (1&nbsp;Pet. 1:10-12). </p>

      rejection of Daniel's authorship are based primarily on naturalistic <em><strong>a 
      priori</strong> </em>dismissal of authentic prediction of the future. Therefore, 
      they claim the book was written pseudonymously sometime after 167 BC to 
      encourage the Jews during the Maccabean revolt. The following facts support 
      the early date. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>There are Qumran (Cave 4) fragments of Daniel dating as early

      a textual tradition had developed. If Daniel was written after 167 BC, then 
      within 22-47 years it would have to have been copied enough times for a 
      textual tradition to develop. Therefore, Daniel was probably written many 
      years before 167 BC. </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1 Maccabees 2:59-61 (dated 140-100 BC) has Mattathias referring

      decent treatment from Alexander because they showed him passages from Daniel 
      that predicted him (e.g., Dan. 7,8,11). Therefore, Daniel was written enough

  <p><strong>Daniel 2: Statue </strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>Overview </strong></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><strong>This vision is dated to 602 BC.</strong> It was granted to Nebuchadnezzar; 
        Daniel interpreted it for him. Since it was given to Nebuchadnezzar, <strong>the 
        statue portrays the humans kingdoms as glorious (man's perspective). Daniel's 
        visions about the same kingdoms reveals them as beasts (God's perspective). 
        </strong></p>
      <p>The &quot;latter days&quot; (vs. 28) refers to &quot;the future&quot; 
        (vs. 29).<strong> The vision describes God's work among the nations who 
        affect Israel. </strong>It skips the Church Age without consideration 
        of it because it does not concern Israel. </p>
      <p><strong>Note: The kingdoms decrease in value (moral quality?), but increase 
        in strength (military?).</strong> The statue is extremely unstable&#151;top-heavy 
        and with a weak base&#151;signifying human kingdoms from God's all-powerful 
        perspective. </p>
      <p>Dan. 2 is the basic prophetic framework; the subsequent visions elaborate 
        on various parts of this framework. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Head of Gold:</strong> NEBUCHADNEZZAR (vs. 38) and those NEO-BABYLONIAN 
      kings that come after him (including Nabonidus and Belshazzar) from 626-539 
      BC. (All dates reflect rule over Israel.) </p>
    <p><strong>Breast &amp; Arms of Silver:</strong> MEDIA-PERSIA (vs. 39a: &quot; 
      . . . after you . . . inferior to you . . . &quot; in quality and administrative 
      organization, not in size) from 539-333 BC. </p>
    <p><strong>Belly &amp; Thighs of Bronze:</strong> GREECE (vs. 39b: &quot; 
      . . . will rule over all the earth&quot; - wide geographic control??) from 
      333-63 BC. </p>
    <p><strong>Legs of Iron &amp; Feet of Iron &amp; Clay:</strong> ROME (Vs 40-43; 
      one kingdom because vs. 40,41 both use same pronoun &quot;it&quot;). This 
      kingdom, however, appears to have two phases. </p>
    <p><strong>Part I (vs. 40):</strong> Two legs encompass both east and west. 
      It is much more powerful than the other kingdoms (&quot; . . . crushes and 
      shatters . . . &quot;). </p>
    <p><strong>Reasons for seeing a <em>Prophetic Gap</em> between vs. 40,41</strong> 
      (more evidence for a gap will be provided in subsequent visions): </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Anatomical distinction:</strong> Vs 40 refers to the legs, while 
        vs. 41 refers to the feet. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Composition distinction:</strong> The legs are composed entirely 
        of iron, while the feet are composed of iron and clay. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>This part of the vision is still unfulfilled.</strong> Vs 44 
        says that &quot;in the days of those kings&quot; (the 10 nations), the 
        God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed.&quot; 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Part II (vs. 41-43):</strong> reasons for &quot;iron and clay&quot; 
    </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Vs 41: It is a divided kingdom, but has the toughness of iron. </p>
      <p>Vs 42: Some of its nations are strong, while some of them are weak (diverse 
        forms of government?). </p>
      <p>Vs 43: There are evidently futile attempts to unify different nations 
        and nationalistic interests through political alliances. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Stone That Becomes a Mountain</strong> (vs. 44): GOD'S KINGDOM 
      evidently destroys the kingdom of iron and clay. </p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p>Daniel receives this vision in 553 BC (vs. 1), between the events of chapters 
      4 &amp; 5. The &quot;sea&quot; (vs. 2) from which the beasts arise is equated 
      with the &quot;earth&quot; (vs. 17), and probably refers to Gentile humanity. 
      This vision clearly correlates with the vision in chapter 2. </p>
    <p><strong>Note: </strong>The beasts <strong>descend in <em>majesty</em> </strong>(correlating 
      to the metals' <i>value</i> in chapter 2), but <strong>increase in <em>terror</em></strong> 
      (corresponding to the metals' <i>strength</i> in chapter 2). </p>
    <p><strong>Lion with Eagle's Wings</strong><i> (vs. 4): </i>NEBUCHADNEZZAR 
      and NEO-BABYLON. Since the head of gold referred to Nebuchadnezzar and Babylon, 
      it seems logical that the first beast is about the same kingdom. Jer. 4:7 
      uses similar imagery to refer to Babylon. Winged lions guarded the gates 
      of the royal palaces. These are two most kingly of animals of the land and 
      air respectively. The wings plucked and a human mind given to it probably 
      refers to the events in Dan. 4:28-37. </p>
    <p> <strong>Bear </strong><i>(</i>vs. 5): MEDIA-PERSIA. It was powerful and 
      ferocious, but less swift than Neo-Babylon. &quot;Raised up on one side&quot; 
      probably refers to the dominance of the Persians over the Medes. The Persians 
      came up last, but were greater and absorbed the Medes (see 8:3,20). The 
      &quot;three ribs&quot; may refer to three decisive battles, three geographical 
      components of the empire (Media, Persia, and Babylon), or to three peoples 
      subdued by them (Babylonians; Lydians; Egyptians). </p>
    <p><strong>Leopard with Four Wings &amp; Four Heads</strong> (vs. 6): GREECE. 
      The leopard was less grand, but far swifter and greatly feared as a beast 
      of prey. The four wings emphasize great speed. Alexander the Great conquered 
      most of the known civilized world (from Macedonia to India) within 10-15 
      years. The four heads refer to the four generals who divided his kingdom 
      after his premature death in 323 BC (see 8:8 for details). </p>
    <p><strong>Terrible Beast </strong>(vs. 7a-11,19-26): ROME. Note the similarities 
      with the statue (iron teeth; crushing and trampling down all before it). 
      Note also the two phases: </p>
    <p><strong>Part I</strong> (vs. 7,23): It will be more powerful and have larger 
      rule than the other kingdoms. Unlike the Greeks, who preferred to absorb 
      culturally while granting relative political autonomy, Rome ruthlessly crushed 
      and slew the peoples they conquered (e.g., Carthage where the Romans slew 
      all the inhabitants, threw the buildings into the sea, and sewed the land 
      with salt). </p>
    <p><strong>Part II </strong>(vs. 7b,8,24-26): This is based on the <b>Prophetic 
      Gap</b> in chapter 2, and the fact that there is no historical fulfillment 
      yet. </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><strong>The ten horns refer to ten kings</strong> (as in 2:44) who arise 
        out of this kingdom, evidently ruling simultaneously. </p>
      <p><strong>The &quot;little horn&quot; is not one of the ten</strong>, but 
        arises after they come into power and deposes three of them. This is the 
        Anti-Christ. His &quot;boasts&quot; (vs. 8) are actually &quot;speaking 
        out against the Most High&quot; (vs. 25). He persecutes Jewish believers 
        (vs. 25) and attempts to make major changes in the Jewish calendar and 
        law. &quot;Time, times, and half a time&quot; probably refers to the first 
        3.5 years of the tribulation, during which God grants him authority (see 
        Dan. 9:27). Vs 26 probably refers to the second 3.5 years, during which 
        he is judged by God (Dan. 9:27)&#151;or simply to his destruction when 
        Messiah comes. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>Son of Man's Eternal Kingdom (vs 9-14,18,27)</b></p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Vs 12 contrasts the end of the first three kingdoms 
      to that of the last. Unlike the last one, which is annihilated completely 
      (evidently by God's kingdom), they are conquered by other human kingdoms 
      but allowed to go on existing in some form. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Daniel 8: Male Goat &amp; Ram </strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>Ram with Two Horns</strong> (vs. 3,4): MEDIA-PERSIA (vs. 20). Note 
      the two horns' similarity to two shoulders of the bear in chapter 7. Just 
      as one of the bear's two shoulders was higher than the other (7:5), so also 
      one of the ram's two horns is longer than the other (8:3). This kingdom 
      did in fact expand northward, southward, and westward. </p>
    <p><strong>Male Goat </strong>(vs. 5-8a): GREECE (vs. 21). Compare the description 
      in 7:6 (&quot;leopard with four wings of a bird&quot;) to 8:5 (&quot;without 
      touching the ground&quot;)&#151;speed. The large horn is Alexander the Great, 
      who defeated the Persians in three decisive battles in 334,333,331 BC. He 
      died at the height of his power at 33 years old in 323 BC. Vs 8b,22 describe 
      his four generals who divided his kingdom (&quot;Give it to the strong&quot;): 
      Seleucus (Syria and lands to the east), Ptolemy (Egypt, Palestine and Arabia), 
      Lysimachus (Turkey), and Cassander (Macedonia and Greece). During the Inter-testamental 
      period, the Seleucid and Ptolemaic kingdoms took turns controlling Palestine 
      because of its strategic importance on the trade route. </p>
    <p><strong>The &quot;little horn&quot;</strong> is the Seleucid king Antiochus 
      IV (Epiphanes), who ruled over Palestine 175-164 BC. What is his relationship 
      to the &quot;little horn&quot; in chapter 7? </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><strong>Similarities between him and the &quot;little horn&quot; of chapter 
        7:</strong> boasters (7:20; 8:11,25), &quot;little horn&quot; (7:8; 8:9), 
        fight with saints (7:25; 8:24). </p>
      <p><strong>Differences from the &quot;little horn&quot; of chapter 7: </strong>They 
        emerge from different kingdoms (AC is from fourth in Dan. 7; AE is from 
        third in Dan. 8), and their period of dominance over Israel is of different 
        duration (AC is 3.5 years; AE is 6.5 years/2300 days). </p>
      <p><strong>Resolution:</strong> Antiochus IV is a <b>Type </b>of the Anti-Christ, 
        which is inferred by 8:17,19 (&quot;<i>pertains</i> to time the end&quot;). 
      </p>
      <p>8:11-14 was fulfilled when Antiochus IV removed the high priest Onias 
        III from 171 BC until 164 BC (2300 days), when Antiochus died. The &quot;abomination 
        of desolation&quot; (vs. 13: &quot;the transgression causes horror&quot;) 
        occurred on December 25, 167 BC, when Antiochus IV sacrificed a swine 
        on the altar of the temple. This sacrilege precipitated the Maccabean 
        Revolt (see Josephus, <i>Antiquities</i>, Book XII, Chapter 5; 1 Macc. 
        4:34ff.). </p>

  <p><strong>Daniel 9: The Prince Who Is To Come </strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>Vs 24: Summary of the entire 70 &quot;weeks&quot; and what will 
      happen afterwards (the millennial kingdom). </strong></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Daniel receives this vision in 538 BC (9:1), as the Jews are nearing 
        the end of their 70 year exile for disregarding the land Sabbaths (9:2; 
        see also Lev. 25:1-7; 26:34,35,43; 2 Chron. 36:20,21). </p>
      <p>This context is the key to understanding the &quot;weeks&quot; as weeks 
        of years. The Jews had disregarded the land Sabbath law for 490 years, 
        since God exiled them one year for every land Sabbath disregarded. Now, 
        God reveals to Daniel the next 490 years of his dealings with Israel. 
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Vs 25: Summary of the first 69 &quot;weeks&quot;&#151;7 &quot;weeks&quot; 
      for the rebuilding of Jerusalem, and 62 &quot;weeks&quot; intervening between 
      the completion and Messiah. </strong></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>The only decree that authorized a full rebuilding of Jerusalem (including 
        fortifications) was the one given in 444 BC by Artexerxes Langimanus (see 
        Neh. 2:1-8). </p>
      <p>Converting from Daniel's 360-day lunar years to our present solar years 
        makes 69 &quot;weeks&quot; just over 476 years long. Crossing from BC 
        to AD requires that we move one year further because there is no &quot;zero&quot; 
        year. This brings us to 33 AD, the very year that Jesus rode into Jerusalem 
        and was hailed as Messiah by the multitude of disciples (see Luke 19:35-44). 
        Notice that when Jesus predicts the destruction of Jerusalem in Luke 19:42-44, 
        he is merely repeating what Daniel predicted on Dan. 9:26 (see below). 
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Vs 26: The gap of time between the 69th and 70th &quot;weeks.&quot;</strong> 
      The break from describing this period as pertaining to the weeks strongly 
      implies that it should be viewed as a gap of unspecified duration. During 
      this gap, Messiah will be rejected and killed, the people of the prince 
      to come (i.e., the Romans) will destroy Jerusalem and the Temple, and there 
      will be many wars over Jerusalem. This corresponds exactly to the &quot;gap&quot; 
      already deduced in chapters 2 and 7. Jesus calls this same period &quot;the 
      times of the Gentiles&quot; which begins when the Romans destroy Jerusalem 
      (Lk. 21:24)&#151;in other words, the Church Age. </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>The &quot;prince who is to come&quot; who desolates the Temple (9:26,27) 
        has already been mentioned in chapter 7 (&quot;little horn&quot;) and 
        will be mentioned in chapter 11. This is clearly the Anti-Christ who emerges 
        from the Roman Empire and who is judged by God himself immediately before 
        he sets up Messiah's kingdom (9:24,27). He is from the &quot;people&quot; 
        who will destroy Jerusalem&#151;the Roman general Titus fulfilled this 
        in 70 AD, which Jesus also predicted in Lk. 19,21. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Vs 27: Summary of the 70th &quot;week.&quot; This is the tribulation.&nbsp; 
      </strong>The prince begins it by making a covenant. He evidently breaks 
      this covenant 3.5 years later by suspending legitimate worship in the Temple 
      and setting up the abomination of desolation. This brings God's judgment 
      on him over the next 3.5 years, culminating in the second coming of Messiah 
      and the millennial kingdom. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Daniel 11,12: Warring Kingdoms </strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>11:1,2 refer to four more kings of Persia</strong>&#151;Cambyses, 
      Pseudo-Smerdis, Darius I Hystapses, and Xerxes I. </p>
    <p><strong>11:3,4 refer to Alexander the Great and his four generals.</strong> 
    </p>
    <p><strong>11:5-20 describes the fate of two of the Greek kingdoms with reference 
      to Israel.</strong> The &quot;king of the South&quot; (vs. 5,8) refers to 
      the Ptolemaic empire, while the &quot;king of the North&quot; (vs. 6,11,13,15) 
      refers to the Seleucid empire. It deals with the battles between them during 
      the 150 years following Alexander's death. This is covered in great detail 
      (which is why the liberals late-date it) because it was of great concern 
      for the Jews who went through it. </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Vs. 17 refers to when the Seleucid king Antiochus 
        the Great gave his daughter (Cleopatra) to marry the seven year old Ptolemy 
        V in 192 BC. This was a diplomatic marriage which failed because Cleopatra 
        consistently sided with her husband against her father. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>11:21-35 describes the rise and activities of Antiochus IV. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Reasons why there is a Type-Gap between 11:35 and 11:36 </strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dan. 11:35 implies a gap</strong> (&quot;. . . until the end 
        time . . .&quot;) as did Dan. 9:26</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dan. 11:1-35 is clearly fulfilled, while Dan. 11:36-12:1 is 
        clearly unfulfilled.</strong> Dan. 12:1,2 (&quot;at that time&quot;) is 
        the Great Tribulation described in Matt. 24:15ff. and Zech. 12-14. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The two people are described differently.</strong> The &quot;king&quot; 
        in Dan. 11:36 is a different name from the &quot;despicable person&quot; 
        of Dan. 11:21. Dan. 11:36,37 do not fit Antiochus IV because he did not 
        reject all gods and assume deity. The king in Dan. 11:40 attacks the &quot;king 
        of the North&quot;&#151;while Antiochus IV <i>is</i> the &quot;king of 
        the North&quot; (11:15,21). </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Jesus says that the abomination of desolation is unfulfilled</strong> 
        (Matt. 24:15). </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>11:36-12:1 describes the activity of the Anti-Christ during the 
      last days. </strong></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>He claims deity (11:36,37). </p>
      <p>He is a warlike ruler (11:38). </p>
      <p>He has total economic control (11:39). </p>
      <p>He goes to war with the &quot;king of the North&quot; and the &quot;king 
        of the South&quot; (11:40). </p>
      <p>He invades the Mideast after passing through countries, ignoring Edom, 
        Moab, and Ammon (11:40,41). </p>
      <p>He carries the campaign into Egypt (11:42). </p>
      <p>Rumors from the northeast cause him to reverse direction and go to Israel 
        (11:44,45). </p>
      <p>He is destroyed at Armageddon (11:45; 12:1). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>12:1-4 describes the end of the tribulation, the resurrection of 
      the tribulational martyrs (see also Rev. 20:4), and the millennial kingdom. 
      </strong></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>The 1260 days in 12:7 evidently covers from the Anti-Christ's abomination 
        of desolation (see Matt. 24:15) to the second coming (3.5 years&#151;see 
        Dan. 9:27). 12:11 includes 30 more days, possibly for the judgment of 
        Israel (see Ezek. 20:34-38). 12:12 includes 45 more days, possibly for 
        the judgment of the nations (see Matt. 25:31-46). Those who are still 
        alive after these judgments are &quot;blessed&quot; because they go into 
        and inhabit (as mortals) the millennial kingdom. </p>

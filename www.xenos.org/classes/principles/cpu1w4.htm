  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Review of previous two weeks:</strong></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In week two we studied God's attributes 
      and then on week three we looked at Biblical anthropology and concluded 
      that man is totally depraved.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&quot;Don't all religions 
    teach the same basic things?&quot; NO! Consider the following foundational 
    differences: </font></strong></p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">There is a fundamental difference 
      between monotheism's and pantheism's view of humanity's main dilemma: <strong><i>true 
      moral guilt</i> (i.e. objective guilt before God because of our violations 
      against his character vs. subjective guilt feelings toward others) before 
      a righteous God</strong> (DIAGRAM WALL BETWEEN US and GOD) vs. ignorance 
      of our union with God that already exists (EASTERN RELIGIONS). See Ps. 14:3; 
      Is. 59:2; Jas. 2:10; Matt. 5:20-48 for passages that speak of true moral 
      guilt. </font></p>
   
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">There is also a fundamental difference 
      between the way Christianity resolves this dilemma and the way other monotheistic 
      religions resolve it: SALVATION THROUGH HUMAN MERIT vs. SALVATION THROUGH 
      <i>SUBSTITUTIONARY ATONEMENT</i>.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Substitutionary Atonement:</strong> 
    <strong>God in his love provides a blameless substitute to bear his righteous 
    judgment of our sins. </strong></font></p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>This concept is a &quot;given&quot; 
      in the biblical revelation.</strong> We can demonstrate its logical coherence 
      (i.e., the only way a righteous God could accept sinful people without compromising 
      his character is by punishing someone in our place), and we can provide 
      analogies of it from human life (CIVIL WAR DRAFT; IRS DEBT)&#151;but we cannot 
      prove its necessity. </font></p>
   
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>God was not <i>obligated</i> 
      in any way (by anything in us or outside himself) to provide atonement for 
      us; it is a free, unmerited gift extended by him.</strong>&nbsp; The motivation 
      for the atonement comes from within God himself&#151;his righteousness and 
      justice demand the payment of death for our sins, and because of his love 
      and mercy he provides that payment for us himself. According to the Bible, 
      the only way God can do this is through the death of his own Son (Gal. 2:21). 
      </font></p>
  </blockquote>

<h3><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong>Progressive Revelation of Substitutionary 
  Atonement</strong></font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The term &quot;progressive revelation&quot; 
    refers to how God reveals himself and his plan <i>gradually </i>over time. 
    Substitutionary atonement is not a New Testament innovation, contrary to this 
    charge by many Jews and Muslims. God instituted it and taught it from the 
    earliest times after the Fall. That's why Paul says it was &quot;witnessed 
    by the law and the prophets.&quot; (Rom 3:21) On Week #1, we traced the lineage 
    of the &quot;seed.&quot; Most of those passages referred to Christ's kingly 
    rule (2nd coming). Now let's look at how the Old Testament develops the idea 
    of substitutionary atonement. </font></p>
 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><a name="a1"></a><strong>Pre-Cross: 
    </strong></font></p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><strong>(Gen. 3:21)</strong> And 
      the LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife, and clothed them. 
      </font></p>
   
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Adam and Eve were ashamed 
        of their nakedness after they sinned </strong>(3:7,8). This was a subjective 
        experience of their objective moral guilt before God. God rejected their 
        unsuccessful attempt to cover their shame with fig-leaves. And out of 
        love, God provided clothing for them&#151;clothing made from animal skins. 
        Was God teaching Adam and Eve that a death had to occur for their shame 
        to be covered? </font></p>
     
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><strong>(Francis Schaeffer) </strong>&quot;Immediately 
        after their rebellion, (Adam and Eve) were now afraid and tried to cover 
        themselves. But in verse 21, God took this covering away and gave them 
        a coat of skins&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Probably, these were the first 
        animals to die. This indicates, I believe, that man could not stand before 
        God in his own covering. Rather, he needed a covering from God&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that 
        required sacrifice and death&#151;a covering provided not by man but by

        of avoiding God's judgment. It is an acceptable sacrifice, because God 
        responds with a promise never to destroy the earth by flood again. Because 
        of human depravity (8:21), we are dependent upon God's mercy and forbearance.

      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">God orchestrated this event, in 
        part, as a prophetic type of the way he would provide a sacrifice for 
        our sins. </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Vs 14 is a prediction that God 
          would one day provide his sacrifice on Mt. Moriah. Mt. Moriah is the 
          site of Jerusalem, the Temple (2&nbsp;Chron.&nbsp;3:1), and Jesus' death. 
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">God, like Abraham, offered up 
          &quot;his son, his only son, whom he loved&quot; (Jn.&nbsp;3:16 probably 
          purposefully echoes this wording). </font></li>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Jesus, like Isaac, carried the 
          instrument of his own death to the site (Jn.&nbsp;19:17). </font></li>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Isaac was old enough to carry 
          wood for the sacrifice up the mountain. We can infer from this that 
          he was probably in his teen years or older. It's unlikely that Abraham 
          in his old age could have forced Isaac down on the altar. Isaac likely 
          offered himself <i>voluntarily</i> in faith, just like Jesus did. </font> 
        </li>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Isaac's deliverance from 
          death was a prophetic type of Jesus' resurrection (see Heb.&nbsp;11:19).

        <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Isaac was the progenitor of 
          the promised &quot;seed&quot; (Gen. 12:3). Through this event, God explains 
          further <i>how</i> the &quot;Seed&quot; would make God's blessing available 
          to all the nations&#151;by dying a substitutionary death. </font> 
          <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Note:</strong> Although 
            Abraham evidently did not yet know this, God later made it very clear 
            that he detested child sacrifice as a form of religious worship (Lev.&nbsp;18:21; 
            Jer.&nbsp;32:35). Furthermore, it is not intrinsically morally objectionable 
            for God to require the life of human beings. He does this ultimately 
            at judgment, and he required the life of his own Son.</font></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Was Jesus referring to this incident 
        in Jn. 8:56,57? &quot;My day&quot; may well refer to Jesus' crucifixion 
        (&quot;my hour;&quot; &quot;my time&quot;). Jesus may be saying that Abraham 
        saw in this event a picture of Jesus' most important act. </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Jesus may have actually been 
          &quot;the angel of the Lord&quot; who directed him not to kill Isaac 
          but offer up the ram instead. Vs 12 indicates that the angel of the 
          Lord, while he speaks of God in the third person, is also the One to 
          whom the sacrifice is offered. (See also Judges&nbsp;13:18,22). </font></li>

      - The tabernacle was a mobile tent that God ordered the nation of Israel 
      to put up every time they pitched camp. It illustrated his desire to dwell 
      among his people, the problem that prevented him from fully doing this&#151;and 
      the solution he would one day provide for this problem. The problem is human 
      sinfulness, illustrated by the physical barriers (veils before the holy 
      place and the holy of holies) and the necessity of priests. The solution 
      is substitutionary atonement offered through God's chosen mediator-priest.

      <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The offerer must lay his hands

        own sins before they could act as a mediator for others. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">They had to go through these grisly 
        ritual sacrifices virtually every day. This not only kept them focused 
        on the problem of sin and God's remedy (substitutionary atonement); it 
        also indicated that these sacrifices were ultimately insufficient (Heb. 
        10:1-4), in that the people had no direct access to God, and they had

        the Lord at the doorway of the tent of meeting may emphasize that God 
        is communicating substitutionary atonement to all the people. It may also 
        symbolize Christ's public death. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The &quot;ark of the covenant&quot;

        ROD: rejection of God's leadership [Num.&nbsp;17:10]; TABLETS: rebellion

        associated with God's righteousness), so their downward look illustrates 
        God's focus on their sins. <br>
        The high priest slays one of the goats and offers its blood on the mercy 
        seat (&quot;mercy&quot; means &quot;to cover&quot; or &quot;to atone&quot;) 
        to atone for the nation's sins that year (vs 16,17). (OVERHEAD ON ELEMENTS

        identification. Then he chases the animal off to the wilderness. This 
        symbolizes that fact that the guilt of their sins has been sent off because 
        of the atoning death of the substitute (vs 20-22). &quot;Forgiveness&quot; 
        (Greek: <i>aphiemi</i>) means &quot;a sending off/away&quot; of our true

      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Again, the fact that this sacrifice

        here translated &quot;sprinkle&quot;, as to &quot;startle&quot;. But this 
        form of the word is used only one other place in the OT - Lev 16:14 - 
        where the high priest sprinkles blood on mercy seat to atone for sin. 
        Moreover, yazah in Isaiah 52:15 is in the "Hiphil imperfect" form (future 
        causitive) of nazah, which is always translated "to sprinkle." - See Koelher 
        and Baumgardner, <i>Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the OT v. 2 </i>(Brill, 
        1995), 683.</font></p>

        diverged from the normal Passover liturgy. The head of the household normally 
        passed the bread out in silence&#151;but Jesus explained that it represented 
        his body/physical death for them. They normally drank four cups&#151;two 
        before the meal and two afterwards. The third cup was called the &quot;cup 
        of redemption,&quot; and Jesus explained its significance in vs.&nbsp;28. 
        The fourth cup was called the &quot;cup of consummation&quot; looking 
        forward to God's future kingdom. In vs 29, Jesus refuses to drink this 
        cup until he comes back. The Jews customarily ended this meal by singing 
        Ps.&nbsp;116-118. Note especially Ps.&nbsp;118:6-9,17,18,22,23, which 
        speak prophetically of Jesus' death and resurrection. See William L. Lane,

  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Concluding Observations</strong></font></p>
 
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Substitutionary atonement 
      is the heart of biblical theology/soteriology. Apart from it, there is no 
      salvation! </strong>Why is it that we no longer do animal sacrifices? <i>Not</i> 
      because we now see they are primitive, barbaric, etc., but because they 
      have been fulfilled by the most terrible sacrifice of all!&nbsp;&nbsp; Through 
      substitutionary atonement and the cross, we see both how serious the sin 
      problem is to God, and how much he loves us. </font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>There is important continuity 
      between the Old Covenant and the New Covenant: People have <em>always</em> 
      been saved by grace through faith </strong>(Heb.&nbsp;11:2), and always 
      through Jesus' death. Old Testament believers were saved by faith through 
      Jesus' <i>future</i> death; we are saved by faith in his <i>past</i> death. 
      The main differences between us and Old Testament believers are that we 
      know more clearly <i>how</i> God made this payment, we know it <i>has been 
      made</i>, and we have the <i>Holy Spirit</i>.&nbsp; </font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>There is also important 
      discontinuity between the Old Covenant and the New Covenant: </strong> Now 
      that Jesus has fulfilled the Old Covenant system, it is <i>obsolete</i> 
      (Heb. 8:13)! One implication of this is that New Testament Christianity 
      should not be ritualistic. In the Old Covenant, God prescribed hundreds 
      of rituals in careful detail. In the New Covenant, he prescribes only two 
      rituals and is so general about them that Christians have argued for twenty 
      centuries about how to observe them! Old Covenant worship prescribed a ritualistic 
      approach to God, both because people could not be indwelt by God's Spirit 
      and in order to teach God's people the elements of redemption. But now that 
      Christ has come and God's Spirit indwells us, God wants us to relate to 
      him personally rather than ritualistically. See Paul's explanation of this 
      in Gal.&nbsp;4:3-11. Roman Catholic and Orthodoxy's insistence on a liturgical 
      and ritualistic spirituality (and the increasing evangelical acceptance 
      of this notion) runs directly counter to God's movement from ritual to personal 
      relationship.</font></li>

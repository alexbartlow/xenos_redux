  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Last week we looked at the <i>identity 
    </i>and <i>ministries </i>(various ways he works in the b-eliever's life) 
    of the Holy Spirit. Yet, in spite of him indwelling us, his love for us, and 
    his ability to empower our sanctification and ministry, many Christians continue 
    to experience an absence of his power working in their lives. If he is all-loving 
    and powerful, why don't we always see constant improvement in our condition? 
    The New Testament also makes it clear that we have a choice and role to play 
    in whether or not we allow the Holy Spirit to do what he so deeply desires.</font></p>

      here.</font></p>

      mind set on the Spirit is life and peace, (7) because the mind set on the

        of his rejection, but as a son and heir who is confident of his love.

  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Paul began using an agricultural metaphor 
    toward the end of Galatians 5, describing the <em>results</em> of walking 
    by the Spirit as the &quot;<em>fruit </em>of the Spirit.&quot;&nbsp; After 
    explaining how to &quot;keep in step with the Spirit&quot; in Gal. 5:25-6:5, 
    he returns to the agricultural metaphor in 6:7-9 (read). His point is obvious--you 
    reap what you sow. This is not Paul's version of karmic law (what goes around 
    comes around), but rather a basic principle of cause and effect in spiritual 
    growth.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">If you sow to your own fallen nature, 
    you will reap &quot;corruption&quot;--which is not damnation, but the lifestyle 
    described in Gal. 5:19-21a as the &quot;deeds of the flesh&quot; (read). If 
    you sow to the Spirit, you will reap &quot;eternal life&quot;--which refers 
    not to heaven, but to the &quot;fruit of the Spirit&quot; as described 5:22,23 
    (read). If you want to reap a good spiritual harvest in your life, you must 
    sow consistently to the Spirit.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The key principle here is that the 
    results don't show up immediately, but later--they always show up. You may 
    choose to get involved in a porn habit because it provides immediate pleasure 
    and escape--but you will reap an eventual harvest of corruption (dissatisfaction 
    with marital sex; bondage to sexual lust; arrested relational development). 
    Or you may choose to get involved in a spiritual habit like Bible memorization. 
    It will not be immediately pleasurable--but you will reap an eventual harvest

    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">What does it look like to &quot;sow 
      to the Spirit?&quot; It means to consistently participate in those activities 
      that the Bible says will eventually result in spiritual growth. Theologians 
      often call these activities the &quot;means of grace.&quot; We like to call 
      them the &quot;means of growth.&quot; Here's what John Stott, one of the

      passage:</font></p>
    <blockquote> <font size="2"> 
      <p>(John R.W. Stott)&nbsp; &quot;(If Paul) speaks in Galatians 5:22 of the 
        harvest of the Spirit, he writes in 6:8 that we are to sow to the Spirit, 
        and then we reap what we sow. Whether we reap the fruit of the Spirit 
        depends on whether we sow to the Spirit. The seeds we sow to the Spirit 
        that produce this harvest are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a disciplined 
        use of the means of grace. That is, daily prayer and meditation on the 
        Scriptures,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;reading Christian books, making 
        Christian friends, and getting engaged in Christian service. It is by 
        a disciplined use of these means of grace that we grow in grace, and the 
        Holy Spirit within us is able to produce the beauty of holiness.&quot; 
        (John R.W. Stott, &quot;The Unforbidden Fruit&quot;, Christianity Today, 
        Aug 17, 1992, p. 36)</p>

      just begun a relationship with God by receiving Christ and being indwelt 
      by the Holy Spirit. In 2:43-47, Luke describes the dynamic spiritual vitality 
      and fruitfulness of these people. In 2:42, he describes how they &quot;sowed 
      to the Spirit&quot; (read).</font></p>
    <blockquote> <font size="2">

          <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Remember, a key element of

            of the Spirit; it is also a dynamic that produces fruit. You can see 
            that Paul includes this in &quot;sowing to the Spirit,&quot; because 
            after enunciating this principle in Gal. 6:7-9, he says 6:10 (read). 
            We should do good to all people--not just Christians, but also those 
            who don&#146;t know Christ. As we give ourselves away in love to serve 
            others for Christ's sake, the Holy Spirit vitalizes us spiritually 
            and gradually transforms our lives. And this would include sharing 
            Christ through word and deed. Therefore, &quot;fellowship&quot; as

        cardiovascular shape. I found out that I could get the biggest bang for 
        my buck by maintaining my target heart rate for 20 minutes, three times 
        a week. The cheapest way to do this was jogging. It was (to say the least) 
        not that enjoyable to begin with. I was out of shape, my stride was poor, 
        and all I thought about the whole time was how much my muscles hurt and 
        how much farther I had to go. But after a while, as I began to experience 
        less stress, better sleep, more vigor, etc., I came to enjoy it more and 
        even increase my running distance. Today it is one of the most enjoyable

      steer, and pedal. Similarly, walking by the Spirit involves the three things 
      described above. With practice, this becomes easier and more natural--though 
      never as natural as riding a bike because there is the consistent opposition 
      of the flesh and Satan.</font></p>

    <i>pleroo</i>) means to be &quot;characterized by.&quot; To be filled with 
    the Holy Spirit means to be characterized by the Holy Spirit. In the following 
    passages, several truths concerning the filling of the Spirit emerge. </font></p>
</dir>
<blockquote> 
  <ol>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Whereas Christians receive the baptism 
      by the Spirit only once (1 Cor 12:13*), it is possible for us to receive 
      repeated &quot;in-fillings.&quot; This was the case with the early church, 
      and Luke is careful to note that this was the key to their vitality and 
      effectiveness in evangelism (see Acts 1:8; 2:4; 4:8,31; 6:3,5; 7:55; 9:17; 
      13:9,52). </font></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <ol start="2">
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The &quot;filling of the Spirit&quot; 
      is connected with our free will. An individual Christian can choose to be 
      or not to be filled. </font></li>

    <p>(Eph. 5:18) And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but 
      be filled with the Spirit,</p>
    </font> </blockquote>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&quot;Be filled with&quot; is present 
      (continuous) tense, imperative mood, and passive voice. Therefore, it is 
      helpful to consider the filling of the Holy Spirit as the result of a Christian's 
      openness to the Spirit's influence. Note the qualities of being filled described 
      in vv. 19 &amp; 20 cf. Col. 3:16</font></p>

  <ol start="3">
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In Paul's letters, the term &quot;filled 
      with the Spirit&quot; (Eph. 5:18) is synonymous with the terms &quot;walking 
      by/according to the Spirit&quot; (see Rom. 8:4-ll; Gal. 5:l6,l8,25). All 
      of these terms emphasize our volition in availing ourselves to the Holy 
      Spirit, and they describe similar results of spiritual vitality.</font></li>

    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&quot;Grieving the Holy Spirit&quot; 
      (Eph. 4:30) and &quot;quenching the Spirit&quot; (1 Thes. 5:19) apparently 
      refer to two different ways in which Christians resist the filling of the 
      Holy Spirit in their lives. In a sense, then, they refer to the opposite 
      of being filled with the Spirit. </font></li>

        such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment, 
        that it may give grace to those who hear. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit 
        of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Let all bitterness

        you are hardening your heart and you may wind up wandering around in a

      the church through various gifted members. </font></li>

<blockquote> 
  <p>As we learned last week, Christians normally receive the Holy Spirit when 
    they believe in the gospel (Eph.&nbsp;1:13,14). The ability to speak in tongues, 
    however, is normally a spiritual gift given only to some Christians (1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;12:30), 
    and is therefore not required for salvation or spiritual growth.</p>
  <p>Some Christian groups, however, teach that there is normally a delay between 
    believing in the gospel and receiving the Holy Spirit, and that the gift of 
    the Holy Spirit is normally manifested by speaking in tongues. Such groups 
    appeal to four passages in Acts (listed below) as scriptural support for these 
    claims. Read each passage (including its context) and answer the following 
    questions: 
  <ul>
    <b> 
    <li>Is there a delay, or tongues--or both?</li>
    </b> 
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <b> 
    <li>Why might God have deviated from the norm in this situation?</li>

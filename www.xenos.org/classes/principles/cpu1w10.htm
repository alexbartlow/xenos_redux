<h3><strong><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name="a1"></a>Introduction </font></strong></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Since the focus of Christianity 
    is on Christ, the Christian worker must have a clear understanding of his 
    person and work. </font></strong></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong><i>Christology</i> is the study 
    of his person; <i>soteriology</i> is the study of his work.</strong> The two 
    are obviously related: who Christ is will determine what he is able to do. 
    Virtually every heresy denies the deity of Christ and therefore also denies 
    to some extent his work on the cross for us. As a rule, liberal (and some 
    neo-orthodox) theologians also deny Christ's deity. Fundamentalists, reacting 
    against this heresy, sometimes underemphasize his humanity. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>The so-called &quot;quest for 
    the historical Jesus&quot; was an attempt by liberal theologians to discover 
    what Jesus was actually like.</strong> Because of their <i>a priori</i> rejection 
    of miracles, the expectation of their inquiry was that the real Jesus would 
    prove to be different than the Jesus portrayed in scripture: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><strong>(Millard Erickson)</strong>&quot; 
      . . . the earthly Jesus was depicted as basically a good man, a teacher 
      of great spiritual truths, but not the miracle-working, preexistent Second 
      Person of the Trinity.&quot; (Erickson, Millard,<i>Christian Theology </i>[Grand 
      Rapids: Baker Book House, 1985], p. 663.) </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Attempts to separate the Jesus of history 
    from the miracle-working so-called Christ of faith proved futile. </font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Different scholars arrive at wildly 
      different conclusions about what Jesus was like. There aren't objective 
      criteria for distinguishing the &quot;real&quot; Jesus from the biblical 
      accounts of him.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Once you take away the miraculous, 
      the deity claims, the sayings that are attributed to the early church, there's 
      hardly anything left. The Jesus Seminar claims that only 20% of the recorded 
      sayings of Jesus are authentic, and an even lower percentage of the recorded 
      deeds. </font></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="3">Incarnation: </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The 
  point in history when the second person of the Trinity entered the human race.</font></strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> 
  The word literally means &quot;enfleshment.&quot;</font></p>
<h3><strong><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name="a2"></a>Hypostatic Union </font></strong></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Definition: </font></strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>At the Incarnation two natures 
      (full deity and full humanity), were inseparably united in the one person 
      of Jesus Christ.</strong> Whereas the Trinity involves three Persons who 
      share the same nature, the hypostatic union involves one Person who has 
      two natures. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Col. 2:9* clearly teaches 
      this doctrine.</strong> Against Gnostic false teachers who denied Jesus' 
      deity and (probably) fleshly body, Paul insists that &quot;in him dwells 
      the fullness of deity in bodily form.&quot; </font></p>
    <blockquote> <font size="2"> 
      <p><b>(Col. 2:9*)</b> For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily 
        form . . .</p>
      </font> </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Jn. 1:1,14 also affirm the 
      hypostatic union. </strong>The Word &quot;was&quot; is in the imperfect 
      tense which might be translated &quot;always was&quot; God (vs 1). Verse 
      1 stresses the eternality, distinct personality and deity of the Word. In 
      verse 14 the emphasis is on a point in time event: &quot;became&quot; flesh 
      (vs 14). </font></p>
    <blockquote> <font size="2"> 
      <p><b>(John 1:1,14)</b> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was 
        with God, and the Word was God&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (14) And the Word 
        became flesh . . .</p>
      </font> </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Full Humanity:</strong> 1 Tim. 
    2:5; Heb. 2:l4,l7; 1 Jn. 4:2; 2 Jn. 1:7 </font></p>
  <blockquote> <font size="2"> 
    <p><b>(1 Tim. 2:5)</b> For there is one God, and one mediator also between 
      God and men, the man Christ Jesus&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

        God in some sense that we all are (like pantheists might). Also, when

      Jesus alive after his execution. The leaders of the city (both Jewish and 
      Roman) were hostile to this movement, and could have easily refuted this 
      claim by exhuming the body. The best explanation for this historical fact 
      is that the tomb was indeed empty and that the witnesses were telling the

  </font></strong></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Essential: </font></strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Jesus' humanity, deity and 
      resurrection are essential because scripture says they are </strong>(see 
      1 Jn. 2:22,23; 4:2,3,14,15; 5:1; 2 Jn. 1:7; 1 Cor. 15:12-34; Rom. 10:9). 
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>His sinlessness and return 
      are essential because they have direct bearing on salvation.</strong> The 
      New Testament is clear and dogmatic on these issues for this reason. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Non-essential:</strong> </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Issues like whether Jesus 
      went to Hades, whether he had a sin-nature, whether he exercises all his 
      divine attributes now, whether he will forever remain incarnate, etc. are 
      not emphasized by the New Testament and therefore should be viewed as non-essential. 
      </font></strong></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong><font face="Arial" size="3">Memory Verses </font></strong></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Col. 2:9* -</strong> Clearest 
    biblical affirmation of the hypostatic union </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Phil. 2:6,7* -</strong> Jesus 
    emptied himself of certain divine privileges at the Incarnation </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Heb. 1:8-10** - </strong>Jesus 
    is God </font></p>

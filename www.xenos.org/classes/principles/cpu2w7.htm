<h3><strong><font face="Arial" size="3">Introduction</font></strong></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The identity and role of the Holy Spirit 
    needs clarification for many Christians. Most denominations have seriously 
    neglected instruction on the Holy Spirit, so that many Christians have virtually 
    no understanding of him. This ignorance has in turn made many vulnerable to 
    unbalanced or unbiblical ideas about the Holy Spirit. There are two dangers 
    that we want to avoid:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Neglect: Without adequate focus on 
    the Spirit, churches become moralistic and deistic. In the late 1800's, there 
    was a near absence of teaching on the Holy Spirit. For example, in Robert 
    Dapney's 900 page work, <i>Lectures in Theology,</i> published in 1878, only 
    4 pages are devoted to the ministry of the Holy Spirit.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Overemphasis: With excessive focus 
    on the Spirit, churches become subjective, sensual, and narcissistic. In 1902 
    the Azuza street revival and the Pentecostal movement that followed brought 
    a needed correction to the lack of teaching on the Holy Spirit but in some 
    areas went too far (e.g. tongues must be spoken to evidence true regeneration). 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">IE. If you are uncomfortable asking 
    God to experience all the Spirit provides OR if you're irritated when your 
    experiences are challenged with scripture, you may be out of step with God. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This lesson surveys the biblical content 
    concerning the identity and role of the Holy Spirit and seeks a balanced approach.</font></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Many people view the Holy Spirit as a force/power
    source that can be tapped into. Against this, the Bible emphasizes the personhood of the
    Holy Spirit. The Spirit is a <i>person</i>, not a force or a part of God.</font></p>

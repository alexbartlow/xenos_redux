  <blockquote> 
    <h3>A. ESSENTIAL FOR SPIRITUAL HEALTH</h3>
    <p> (1 Pet. 2:2* like newborn babes, long for the pure milk of the word, that 
      by it you may grow in respect to salvation,)</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <h4>Attitude</h4>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> Newborn babies &quot;drink for their lives.&quot; You need to be in 
          the Word as though your life depends on it&#151;because it does! </p>
        <p>This passage is not just about new Christians. Peter says that this 
          attitude should characterize <i>all</i> Christians. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Appetite</h4>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> Appetite is normally cultivated&#151;it doesn't just happen magically. 
        </p>
        <p>Most people don't start drinking beer or coffee because they like the 
          taste. They drink them because they like the effect&#151;then they <i>develop</i> 
          a taste. </p>
        <p>This is the way it usually is with the Word. It can be difficult, and 
          it is not always super-exciting. But the effect is great, so this helps 
          us cultivate an appetite for it (EXAMPLE: PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMPLETED 
          UNITS 1&amp;2). </p>
        <p>Ask God to give you an insatiable hunger for his Word. Then by faith, 
          expose yourself to it&#151;and watch God answer! </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h4><b>Aim</b></h4>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> Peter says the goal is not merely that we may &quot;know,&quot; but 
          that we may &quot;grow.&quot; </p>
        <p>This is the clearest passage that the Word is a means of growth (&quot;salvation&quot; 
          here is a synonym for sanctification). </p>
        <p>See also Psalm 1; Matt. 7:24-27; Jn. 8:31,32; 17:17; 2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 
          12:2; 1 Tim. 4:6. There is no growth apart from God's Word! No amount 
          of intake from other means of growth can make up for intake of the Word!</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h4>How often do we need Word intake?</h4>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Acts 2:42 <small>And they were continually devoting themselves to the 
          apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to 
          prayer.<br>
          </small>- The early church received apostolic teaching &quot;daily.&quot; 
        </p>
        <p>MANNA (Deut. 8:3; Matt. 4:4) - They had to gather it daily&#151;they 
          could not store it up. It didn't taste exciting, but it kept them from 
          disease. </p>
        <p>Deut. 8:3- &quot;And He humbled you and let you be hungry, and fed 
          you with manna which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that 
          He might make you understand that man does not live by bread alone, 
          but man lives by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of the LORD</p>
        <p>Ps. 1:2; 119:97 - The psalmist meditated on the Word &quot;day and 
          night.&quot; </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>B. ESSENTIAL FOR SPIRITUAL MATURITY&nbsp;</h3>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><small>(Heb. 5:11-14**)</small><font size="2">11 Concerning him we have 
      much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing. 
      12 For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again 
      for someone to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God, 
      and you have come to need milk and not solid food. 13 For everyone who partakes 
      only of milk is not accustomed to the word of righteousness, for he is a 
      babe. 14 But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have 
      their senses trained to discern good and evil.</font></p>
    <p>These people were in a state of arrested spiritual development because 
      they were relatively ignorant of God's Word. We can conclude that <i>spiritual 
      maturity is dependent upon in-depth understanding of God's Word.</i> The 
      author holds high standards of biblical understanding for the average Christian 
      (to whom this is addressed). He paints a 4-fold profile of spiritually mature 
      people: </p>
  </blockquote>
  <ol>
    <ol>
      <li><b> We should be familiar with the content of scripture </b>(Heb. 5:13 
        - &quot;accustomed to the word of righteousness&quot;). This means we 
        should know all of the major doctrines of the Bible(sin, salvation, nature 
        of Christ and man, etc.), and be familiar enough that we could find where 
        they are taught. </li>
      <li><b> We should be able to digest solid food<i>.</i></b> This means that 
        they should be able not only to understand and apply to their own lives 
        the simpler &quot;milk&quot; truths (Old Testament BASICS [Heb 6:1,2];

<h2><a name="a2">Relationship With Other Means Of Growth </a></h2>
<blockquote> 
  <h3>PRAYER </h3>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>In our prayer life, the Bible provides the proper basis for knowing God 
      by telling us what he is like. According to Jesus, effective prayer is based 
      on the Word (John 15:7). John promises that &quot;if we ask anything according 
      to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us in whatever we 
      ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him&quot; 
      (1 John 5:14). This is a powerful promise, but it is conditional. We have 
      to ask &quot;according to His will.&quot; But how do we know what God's 
      will is apart from Scripture? </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>MINISTRY </h3>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Serving love is a means of growth, but effective service involves &quot;speaking 
      the truth in love&quot; (Ephesians 4:15). No ministry will have the power 
      God wants it to have unless the one ministering is powerful in the Word 
      of God. Even task-oriented ministers who may not teach or preach need the 
      wisdom available in God's Word. We will not be effective at ministry or 
      in our personal growth if we cannot fend off the attacks of Satan, and this 
      is not possible unless we are able to cite our authority from Scripture. 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>BODY-LIFE </h3>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The basis for Christian fellowship is not only love but truth. The Body 
      of Christ is a community of truth, and these two can never be separated. 
      In Philippians 1:9-10 Paul prays, &quot;that your love may abound still 
      more and more in real knowledge and all discernment, so that you may approve 
      the things that are excellent, in order to be sincere and blameless until 
      the day of Christ.&quot; Truth is the framework that makes real love possible. 
      This is why we are called on to &quot;speak the truth in love&quot; to one 
      another (Ephesians 4:15). </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>DISCIPLINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h3>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The discipline of the Holy Spirit is a means of growth, but it won't be 
      effective unless we respond appropriately. We need Scripture, like that 
      in Hebrews 12, to teach us how to respond to discipline in a way that promotes 
      growth, as we shall see. </p>

<h2><a name="a3">Overview of the Bible </a></h2>

  <p>Teacher's note: Orient students to the &quot;Overview of the Bible&quot; 
    chart in their notes. The left column lists key dates on the biblical timeline. 
    The middle column describes major themes and events. The column on the right 
    notes relevant passages.</p>
  <p><b>We need the big picture</b><br>
    When we study a passage in isolation without knowing the main events and themes 
    in the Bible, we are more prone to misunderstand what we are reading. Students 
    of the Bible need to appreciate the broader context in order to accurately 
    interpret individual passages. What follows is an overview of the Bible. In 
    it we will briefly look at key events in biblical history and the themes that 
    tie them together.</p>
  <p><b>A single story</b><br>
    What would you expect if you read a book that was written by dozens of people 
    from a variety of cultures spread out over 1500 years and four different languages? 
    The end result would no doubt be a mishmash of unconnected stories, ideas, 
    and sayings. </p>
  <p>Instead, what we find when we read the Bible is a well crafted story, complete 
    with main characters, a developing plot line, a climax and conclusion. Despite 
    the authors being separated by time, culture, geography and language, the 
    books they wrote reveal a single author, God himself, behind the scenes crafting 
    an amazing story. <br>

        Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit. Theologians call their act of 
        disobedience &quot;the Fall&quot; because it marks the introduction of 
        sin into the human race. Two main consequences resulted from the Fall: 
        <p><b>Separation from God</b><br>
          Think of how painful it would have been, after being in regular close 
          contact with God, to be driven out of the Garden. To ensure they would 
          never return and to keep them from finding the tree of life, God posted 
          an angel to guard the entrance to the garden. They were not allowed 
          to return to God's presence.</p>
        <p><b>Lost dominion</b><br>
          When Adam and Eve rebelled against God, they rejected his offer to rule 
          with him over creation, and chose instead to live under the rule of 
          God's enemy, Satan. As a result, the whole world, according to John, 
          &quot;lies in the power of the evil one.&quot; In Ephesians 2 we're 
          described as Satan's subjects: before we knew Christ we walked &quot;according 
          to the Prince of the Power of the Air.&quot; </p>
        <p><b>God's recovery plan</b><br>
          Any good story starts out with a problem that needs to be resolved. 
          The Bible is no different: separation from God and lost dominion - these 
          are the problems that frame the rest of the biblical story. They are 
          deep problems that mankind will not be able to fix without outside help. 
          God will need to intervene with a rescue plan.</p>
        <p>Our first hint at God's response to these problems comes immediately 
          after the Fall. After the serpent deceives Eve, God curses him (read 
          Genesis 3:15). Just as a good story teller uses foreshadowing to give 
          readers clues about what lies ahead, in Genesis 3:15 we see a hint of 
          how God will begin to address the problems caused by the Fall. Eve's 
          seed will crush the serpent on the head (pointing to the decisive death 
          blow that Christ would deal Satan on the cross) and the serpent will 
          bruise Eve's seed on the heel (referring to the horrible cost Christ 
          incurred in dealing that death blow - crucifixion). </p>
        <p>From the very beginning, God has a rescue plan, but as the plot continues, 
          things go from bad to worse. In Genesis 4 we read that Adam and Eve's 
          son Cain kills his brother Abel. By Genesis 6, the author notes that 
          &quot;Every intent of the thoughts of man's heart was only evil continually.&quot;</p>
        <p>Things were so bad that God wiped out the human race in a flood and 
          started fresh with Noah. But more problems develop. Noah's descendants 
          become so prideful and audacious that they build a tower to reach the 
          heavens in order to make a name for themselves - a direct affront to 
          God. And so, as Genesis unfolds, we're exposed to the tenacious problem 
          of human rebellion and it's destructive effects. The problems that began 
          the story have only deepened.</p>

          <br>
          Theologians call this the Abrahamic covenant, and in this covenant, 
          God provides a more detailed outline of his plan to rescue humans. The 
          covenant consists of three promises:</p>

        <p>While in Egypt (show map), Joseph rose to a powerful position in the 
          court of Pharaoh and became his right-hand man. He was a skillful administrator 
          and with God's help, was able to prepare the Egyptians for the coming 
          of a 7-year famine. During the famine, inhabitants of the ancient near 
          east, including Jacob and his 11 remaining sons, had to turn to the 
          Egyptians to obtain the grain they needed to avoid starvation.</p>
        <p>While in Egypt, Jacob and his sons were reunited with Joseph. He used 
          his influence to help them and they never returned to Canaan. Instead, 
          they and their descendants remained in Egypt for 400 years. During this 
          prolonged stay, the Jews fell out of favor with the Pharaohs and were 
          forced into slave labor. </p>
        <p>God used all of these events to honor his covenant with Abraham. It 
          was in Egypt that the small band of people descended from Abraham, Isaac 
          and Jacob multiplied and grew into &quot;a great nation.&quot; When 
          the Jews left Egypt to escape slavery under Pharaoh and cross the Red 
          Sea, there were 600,000 men on foot (see Exodus 12:37). With women and 
          children, that's over a million people! </p>

        themselves - a system of law to guide their social and spiritual lives. 
        <p>On Mount Sinai, God dictated the terms of his law to Moses in the form 
          of a covenant between himself and the people - the Mosaic Covenant. 
          This agreement obligated the Jews to obey an elaborate system of laws. 
          It included not just the ten commandments, but over 600 laws explaining 
          how the Jews were to live and interact with God. </p>
        <p>The law made it clear that the Jews we not able to directly approach 
          God because of their sin. The law also hinted at how God might one day 
          remove the barrier of sin between himself and his people. Once a year 
          the Jewish high priest would place his hands on a goat and confess the 
          sins of the people, symbolically transferring their sins to the goat. 
          Then he would shoo the goat into the wilderness - away from the Israelite's 
          camp - a vivid symbol of sin being removed from the people. Then the 
          high priest would take another goat, kill it, and spatter its blood 
          over the top of a box (the ark). God's anger towards the people because 
          of their sin was satisfied when he saw the blood and recognized that 
          an innocent, spotless substitute had died in their place. This &quot;<b>atonement 
          blessing</b>&quot; symbolically paid for human sin by the sacrifice

          <p>Isaiah 53:5 But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He 
            was crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our well-being 
            fell upon Him, And by His scourging we are healed. 6 All of us like 
            sheep have gone astray, Each of us has turned to his own way; But 
            the LORD has caused the iniquity of us all to fall on Him.</p>
        </blockquote>

          again, only this time it's not the blood of an animal sacrifice being 
          presented to God, but the blood of a human - a human sacrifice to pay 
          for human sin. </p>
        <p>This man, this suffering servant, is called God's chosen one or &quot;messiah.&quot; 
          But instead of being depicted here as a coming king, he serves as a 
          human sacrifice to atone for the sin of the people. Through his sacrifice, 
          all of the people of the world are blessed (see 52:15). The first problem 
          caused by the Fall, sin causing separation from God, isn't ultimately 
          dealt with by animal sacrifice, but instead by the death of this man.</p>
        <p>Lost dominion</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Isaiah 9:6 &quot;For a child will be born to us, a son will be given

            will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince 
            of Peace. 7 There will be no end to the increase of His government 
            or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom, To establish 
            it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and 
            forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This child who is born is described as a human, but Isaiah says that 
          he is also God. This human son will sit on &quot;the throne of David.&quot; 
          Isaiah is clearly tying this promise to the Davidic Covenant. He is 
          describing a descendant of David and Solomon who will restore God's 
          dominion forever. </p>

          that sin must be paid for by the blood offering of an spotless, innocent 
          substitute. God told Isaiah a human, my chosen one, will have to die 
          and atone for human sin. And here, in John 1:29, when John sees Christ 
          coming to be baptized, he tells us, &quot;behold the lamb of God who 
          takes a way the sin of the world.&quot; </p>
        <p>This is such a rich passage! So many of the images and symbols - the 
          foreshadowing we've studied so far - are called to mind in this verse. 
          Jesus was the sacrificial lamb symbolized in the ceremonial law, he 
          was the chosen one who would come and die for the people, he was the 
          descendant of Abraham through whom all the nations of the earth would 
          be blessed, he was the solution to man's first problem: separation from 
          God caused by our sin. </p>
        <p>Jesus was not just a religious innovator who put a new spin on Judaism. 
          He was standing on the shoulders of centuries of prophecy, of symbols, 
          and promises that all pointed to him - all describing why he was coming 
          and what he would do. </p>

          over the Roman world, the Romans attacked Jerusalem. They burned the 
          city and deported its population. During his ministry, Jesus actually 
          predicted that this would occur (Luke 21:24 read). This verse also suggests 
          that the removal of the Jews from their homeland wouldn't be permanent. 
          By saying &quot;Jerusalem will be trampled under foot by the Gentiles 
          <i>until</i> the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled&quot;, Jesus is 
          implying that at a later date, Jerusalem will once again be under Jewish

        <p>During &quot;the time of the Gentiles&quot;, the church is to carry

          is no church within those cultures actively sharing the gospel. Worldwide, 
          the number of evangelical Christians is increasing three times faster

          out of 10 people on the earth have a Bible written in their own language

        <p>For two millennia, Jews have been living all over the world without 
          a homeland. In the late 1800s, however, they began trickling back into 
          Palestine. In 1947, the British ceded control of Palestine to the United 
          Nations, who in turn, designated part of it to become a Jewish state. 
          On May 14, 1948, the modern nation of Israel came into existence under 
          the leadership of David Ben-Gurion. </p>
        <p>From the beginning, surrounding Arab countries opposed Israel's existence, 
          but Israel defended herself and remained in the land. In 1967, after 
          the &quot;Six-Day War&quot; against Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, Israel 
          also gained full control of Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Never in human history has a widely distributed group of ancient peoples 
          like the Jews reconstituted themselves as political entity, back in 
          their homeland. Where are the ancient Hittites or the Jebusites? Gone! 
          But the Jews, against all odds, were able to reconvene in their land. 
          And this was predicted well in advance, not just by Christ, but the 
          Old Testament prophets as well.<br>

      <td valign="top" colspan="3" height="411">As we move toward the end of the 
        Bible's story, we've seen the answer to problem 1 - separation from God 
        caused by sin. But what about the problem of lost dominion? What about 
        God's promise to David that one of his descendants, a God-king, would 
        come and sit on his throne? The reemergence of Israel as a nation in her 
        land is an encouraging sign, but we still haven't seen the fulfillment 
        of the Davidic covenant or the final solution to our second problem. 
        <p>The problem of lost dominion won't be resolved until Christ (&quot;messiah&quot;) 
          returns. When Jesus comes for the second time, it won't be to die for 
          sin, but instead to set up his throne as messiah-king and reestablish 
          his rule. </p>
        <p>Of course, we need a climactic end to any good story, and the Bible 
          delivers. Before God's kingdom can be established, one more obstacle 
          needs to be removed... the kingdom of Satan. </p>
        <p>Just prior to the return of Christ, the Bible describes a seven year 
          period of political turmoil, war, and conflict, a time dominated by 
          a dynamic, Satanically-empowered leader called the &quot;Antichrist.&quot; 
          Acting as Satan's agent, the antichrist will set up a government and 
          rule the world for a while. This period of time is called the &quot;Tribulation.&quot;</p>
        <p>Recall Daniel's prediction (see Dan. 2:44) that God's kingdom would 
          arrive at the end of history to smash all of the kingdoms that came 
          before it. This is how it will be when Christ comes back: he will defeat 
          Satan and the Antichrist; he will vanquish all of his enemies and set 
          up his kingdom on Earth. For more on this period of history and these 
          events, check out unit 1, week 9.</p>

            the imagery, the foreshadowing - all of this developing as the story 
            unfolds and all of it so neatly tied together at the end - you have 
            to wonder, who wrote this book? If God didn't oversee the recording 
            of this story, how did this happen? How could a book with so many 
            authors who are so different from each other ever achieve this?</p>
          <p>So that's an overview of the Bible - a single story written by God 
            through many authors. Having the big picture (the broader context) 
            will help you better understand the individual passages that we study.</p>

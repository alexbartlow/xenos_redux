<h3>Introduction </h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Review the concept of &quot;means of growth&quot; and discuss those covered 
    so far (Acts&nbsp;2:42). </p>
  <p>Remind the students that the Means of Growth are biblically prescribed avenues 
    through which we receive the life changing power of God.&nbsp; Remember that 
    it is one of three aspects of <a href="cpu2w8.htm">walking in the Spirit</a>.&nbsp; 
  </p>
  <p>We come now to another means of growth, &#151;<i>fellowship</i>, or Body-life. 
    This means of growth is not well understood in the church today. &quot;Fellowship&quot; 
    (<i><b>koinonia</b></i>) means &quot;sharing.&quot; We are to share the life 
    of Christ with one another. Spiritual growth has a corporate context.&nbsp; 
  </p>
  <p>Fellowship stands in stark contrast to the radical individualism of our culture 
    which often finds its way into &quot;American Christianity.&quot; Church is 
    incorrectly defined as a building or the service we attend.&nbsp; &quot;Fellowship&quot; 
    occurs in a hall next to the sanctuary, or people participate in the &quot;ritual 
    of fellowship&quot; (card passing down the pew or shaking a neighbor's hand 
    during the service).&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Therefore we purposefully distance ourselves from these wrong perceptions 
    of church and choose &quot;body life&quot; as a term that more accurately 
    reflects the New Testament picture of fellowship.</p>
 
  <p><a name="a0"></a>A key question arises: <b>&quot;How involved in Christian 
    fellowship should I be?&quot;</b><i> </i>What is the biblically normative 
    level of involvement in the Body of Christ? </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The typical answer is &quot;Attend church worship service on Sunday mornings.&quot; 
      In Xenos, this sounds like &quot;Attend <a href="../../ministries/ct/ct.htm">central 
      teaching</a> weekly.&quot; Others believe fellowship is defined by the number 
      of committees on which I serve.&nbsp; These answers are inadequate. If this 
      is the extent of our involvement with other Christians, we will be seriously 
      stunted in our spiritual growth, probably seduced by the world, etc. Instead 
      we must see how the New Testament answers this question.&nbsp; There is 
      a big difference between &quot;going to church&quot; and &quot;being in 
      fellowship.&quot; </p>
   
    <p>For many of us we'll have to challenge our upbringing; our past experiences 
      in the local church; and our culture. For ALL of us, we'll have to challenge 
      our priorities and our agenda in life. </p>
   
    <p>To answer this question, we need to go to the New Testament's description 
      of our new identity in Christ.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3><a NAME="a1">1. Involved enough to live consistently with our </a><a HREF="cpu2w3.htm">new 
  identity</a> (1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;12**; Rom.&nbsp;12**) </h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Let's take a brief look at the importance of <b>the <i>vertical</i> aspect 
    of being &quot;in Christ&quot; &#151; our union with Christ</b>.&nbsp; Our 
    standing before God is based on the fact that we have been &quot;put into&quot; 
    Christ; 1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;12:13 &#151;review baptism by Holy Spirit &#151; 
    Him indwelling us and simultaneously placing us into Christ. </p>
  <p>What is our identity? Forgiven, Accepted, and Secure in our relationship 
    with the Creator of the universe. Our greatest needs have been met by God. 
    This is our new identity. </p>
  <p>This is a <i>positional </i>truth&#151;we didn't feel it happen, but we believe 
    it on the basis of God's Word (&quot;CONSIDER&quot;) and choose to act consistently 
    with it (&quot;PRESENT&quot;) in our dealings with God (e.g., DRAWING NEAR 
    IN SPITE OF GUILT FEELS AS PER HEB.&nbsp;10:19ff.). As we do this, we begin 
    to grow and experience God's love and acceptance (LEARN &gt;&gt; ACT &gt;&gt; 
    EXPERIENCE).</p>
  <p>But having a new identity also has a <i><b>horizontal</b></i><b> aspect</b>. 
    God has not only changed our standing with him, he has also changed our standing 
    with other Christians. Our new identity makes us members of one another (1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;12:12-14; 
    Rom.&nbsp;12:3-5). 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><small><font size="-1">1 Cor. 12:12 For even as the body is one and yet 
      has many members, and all the members of the body, though they are many, 
      are one body, so also is Christ. 13 For by one Spirit we were all baptized 
      into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were 
      all made to drink of one Spirit. 14 For the body is not one member, but 
      many.<br>
      </font> </small></p>
    <p> <font size="-1">Rom. 12: 3 For through the grace given to me I say to 
      every man among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to 
      think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to 
      each a measure of faith. 4 For just as we have many members in one body 
      and all the members do not have the same function, 5 so we, who are many, 
      are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.</font></p>
    <p>Therefore, we need to believe this on the basis of God's Word (&quot;CONSIDER&quot;) 
      and choose to act consistently with it in our interactions with other Christians 
      (&quot;PRESENT&quot;). If we don't, we will miss out on the growth God offers. 
      Nowhere does the Bible describe a growing Christian who isn't involved in 
      the Body of Christ. <br>
      <br>
      This interaction involves two distinct aspects: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> 
        <p> <b>We need to regularly <i>receive </i>the life of Christ from other 
          members</b> <br>
          1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;12:21&gt;&gt;contrary to AUTONOMY; INDIVIDUALISM; Normally, 
          we learn this lesson first. </p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p>Then, <b>we need to regularly <i>give </i>the life of Christ to others 
          </b><br>
          1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;12:15,16 &gt;&gt; Giving love does not come naturally. 
          Most people are naturally self-centered and we see it manifested in 
          behaviors like:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Believing that others are around only to serve us.</p>
          <p>Judging relationships based on how that person makes me feel</p>
          <p> Expecting others to be sensitive to my needs and disappointed when 
            they are not.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>or - &quot;I'M INSIGNIFICANT&quot;. &quot;I don't have anything 
              to offer anyone in a friendship that they could want. I'm worthless.&quot; 
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
  </ul>
  <p> The Body of Christ is a key provision for growth from God by which our understanding 
    of Christ is deepened, where we have the opportunity to express Christ's love 
    to others, and where we personally and often intimately experience the love 
    of Christ.</p>
  <p> Therefore, we need to be involved enough to receive and give the life of 
    Christ.&nbsp; Now that we understand the theological basis for Body-life, 
    we can move to more practical ways to incorporate this into our lives. Jesus 
    gives us a similar answer with a little different spin.</p>

  you&quot;</a> </h3>

  <p><b>(Jn.&nbsp;13:34,35)</b> &quot;A new commandment I give to you, that you 
    love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another. 
    By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for 
    one another.&quot;</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Explain Jn.&nbsp;13:34,35. Note the same two-sided involvement&#151;giving 
      love to other Christians and allowing other Christians to give love to us. 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The disciples were committed to this imperative from Jesus and therefore 
    committed their ministries to living this out.&nbsp; Their epistles unpack 
    this command through several &quot;one another&quot; imperatives. NAME THEM:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> 
      <p>Gal. 5:13 For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn 
        your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve 
        one another. </p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <p>1 Thess. 5:11 Therefore encourage one another, and build up one another, 
        just as you also are doing. </p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <p>Col. 3:16 Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you, with all wisdom 
        teaching and admonishing one another&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; </p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <p>Jas. 5:16 Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one 
        another, so that you may be healed. </p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <p>Eph. 4:32 And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, 
        just as God in Christ also has forgiven you. </p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <p>Eph.&nbsp;4:2 &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;with all humility and gentleness, 
        with patience, showing forbearance to one another in love&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <p>Rom.&nbsp;15:7 Wherefore, accept one another, just as Christ also accepted 
        us to the glory of God. </p>
    </li>
    <li> Gal.&nbsp;6:2 Bear one another's burdens, and thus fulfill the law of 
      Christ. </li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Are we involved enough to know others' concerns, worries, and burdens?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li> Rom. 12:10 Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; give preference 
      to one another in honor&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; </li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Devoted:&nbsp; tenderly loving; showing affection.&nbsp; (Rom. 16:18)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li> 
      <p>Rom.&nbsp;12:16 Be of the same mind toward one another; do not be haughty 
        in mind, but associate with the lowly.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <dd>We will look at two of the key ones next week: encourage and admonish. 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><i><b>What does this have to do with how involved we should be in fellowship?</b> 
        </i></p>
    </blockquote>
  </dd>
</dl>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>We should be involved enough that we are receiving and giving this kind 
      of love from and to other Christians on a regular basis. This assumes an 
      intensive level of involvement with a relatively small number of people. 
      How could we possibly accomplish this if our only context for knowing people 
      was a large group meeting on a Sunday morning?&nbsp; These biblical principles 
      of body life require being in a small setting of people.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>

      <li> How can you show forbearance and forgiveness unless you're involved 
        enough that they offend or irritate you? </li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p> <b>Structures that facilitate this kind of involvement:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Home groups </i>are meant to facilitate this. This is the example of 
      the New Testament (Acts&nbsp;2:42,46,47; Rom.&nbsp;16). While they do not 
      assure Body-life involvement, they provide a context within which to build 
      these kinds of relationships that go on through the week. <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><i>Cell/study groups</i>: This is an even smaller context for getting 
      to know people in your home group, building friendships that carry through 
      the week.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><i>Fellowship after Central Teaching: </i>Evangelism-focused home groups 
      at the College and Main Campus central teachings wisely use the time after 
      the meeting to fellowship. Deliberate effort is made by the church to provide 
      an environment that makes it easy and fun to stay after the teachings for 
      a while and hang out with one another. It is a great opportunity for guests 
      to see and experience John 13:34,35 in a manner that won't happen if the 
      group just gets up and goes home after the meeting. If we have no guests 
      that week, it is a great opportunity to build depth with other members of 
      the body of Christ.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><i>Time outside meetings:&nbsp; </i>e.g. &#151; regular one-on-one time 
      with others (breakfasts, lunches, hang out at someone's house, etc.). This 
      is where discipleship usually occurs. There is time to study the Word together, 
      pray together, discuss personal issues, and get to know one another on a 
      deeper level.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><em>Ministry houses: </em>Living<i> </i>with Christian roommates provides 
      an excellent<i> </i>context for learning and practicing Body-life. <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><i>Retreats</i>: Many people experience Body-life for the first time on 
      a weekend retreat when people can get a sustained dose of it.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><i>Praying with others in your home group</i>: There is something about 
      talking openly to God with others that binds you closer together around 
      Christ.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><i>Vacations with others in your home group</i>: Experiencing new things 
      together, coupled with additional times for sharing and prayer add a whole 
      new dimension to vacations.</li>
  </ul>

<p> <b>Can a lifestyle of self-giving love be fulfilling?</b> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The world views this lifestyle of giving oneself for the good of others as 
    madness, but God calls us to this (Phil.&nbsp;2:3-5*).</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> Phil. 2: 3 Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility 
      of mind let each of you regard one another as more important than himself; 
      4 do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the 
      interests of others. 5 Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in 
      Christ Jesus,</p>
    <p><b>This is the paradox of self-giving love</b>, or &quot;ministry as a 
      means of growth.&quot; We actually receive as we give. <em>We are never 
      commanded in the Bible to evaluate how well others are doing in their &quot;job&quot; 
      of loving us!&nbsp; </em>That view comes from our &quot;consumer society&quot; 
      &#151; how well are others serving me?&nbsp; We are commanded to love others 
      in the power of Jesus Christ based on His love for us.</p>
    <p>We don't wait until we get all our problems fixed before we give. Often 
      we use the excuse &#151; &quot;I'm too messed up emotionally and relationally 
      to give to someone else.&quot; &quot;I'm going through some hard times in 
      a relationship, at work, at school &#151; I can't give to someone else until 
      these are cleared up!!&quot; </p>
    <p>God has uniquely designed the cure to our many hang ups through the paradox: 
      &quot;I'll change you as you serve others.&quot;&nbsp; As we give to others 
      we will be fulfilled by God, as He &quot;fixes&quot; me up.&nbsp; So often 
      it is an act of faith&#151; I <em>feel</em> acutely in need yet <em>choose</em> 
      to act in love toward others, <em>trusting </em>that God will meet my needs.</p>

      <p>A healthy physical body is the result of EXERCISE AS WELL AS NUTRITION. 
      </p>
      <p> THE DEAD SEA is dead because minerals and nutrients flow in, but it 
        has no outlet. These minerals could sustain life, but the Dead Sea cannot 
        support life because the nutrients are so concentrated. In the same way, 
        Christians will not benefit from the spiritual nutrients that God supplies 
        if they are unwilling to love others and practice what they learn. A vital 
        relationship with Christ requires both receiving his love and giving it

          we to buy bread, that these may eat?&quot; (6) And this He was saying

          answered Him, &quot;Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient 
          for them, for everyone to receive a little.&quot; (8) One of His disciples, 
          Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to Him, (9) &quot;There is a lad

          Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number 
          about five thousand. (11) Jesus therefore took the loaves; and having 
          given thanks, He distributed to those who were seated; likewise also 
          of the fish as much as they wanted. (12) And when they were filled, 
          He said to His disciples, &quot;Gather up the leftover fragments that 
          nothing may be lost.&quot; (13) And so they gathered them up, and filled

          that His hour had come that He should depart out of this world to the 
          Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to 
          the end&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;(3) Jesus, knowing that the Father

          His garments; and taking a towel, He girded Himself about. (5) Then

          and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;(12) 
          And so when He had washed their feet, and taken His garments, and reclined

    <p><b>Qualification:</b>&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Many times Christ would take time to rest and eat (and taught his disciples 
      to do the same) &#151; e.g. Mk. 6:31.&nbsp; He would not wait for all needs 
      to be met but rather understood that our finite nature and our call to be 
      stewards of all our resources (including our physical and mental capabilities) 
      required rest.&nbsp; Rest enables us to go the long distance for Christ.&nbsp; 
      If we do not have the ability to say &quot;no&quot; at any time, we will 
      ruin ourselves and our families.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Most of us are not apt to give too much, but are selfish. We are committed 
      to our rest and comfort and need to recognize our selfishness as a barrier 
      to spiritual growth. We need to commit to a servant lifestyle and learn 
      balance in our finances, schedule, vacations, etc. as we serve God.</p>

      may be encouraged, having been knit together in love, and attaining to all 
      the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding, resulting 
      in a true knowledge of God's mystery, that is, Christ Himself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;(19) 
      (The false teachers are) not holding fast to the head, from whom the entire 
      body, being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments, grows 
      with a growth which is from God.</p>

  <p><i>4. Materialism</i> (&quot;I'm too busy with my career/schooling/hobbies/house 
    to be this involved with other Christians.&quot;) </p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>(1 Jn. 2:10,15)</b> The one who loves his brother abides in the light 
      and there is no cause for stumbling in him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Do 
      not love the world, nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, 
      the love of the Father is not in him.</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Loving the values of the world-system is contradictory to loving one 
        another with God's love. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>(1&nbsp;Jn.&nbsp;3:14-17)</b> We know that we have passed out of death 
      into life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in 
      death. (15) Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer; and you know that 
      no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. (16) We know love by this, 
      that He laid down His life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for 
      the brethren. (17) But whoever has the world's goods, and beholds his brother 
      in need and closes his heart against him, how does the love of God abide 
      in him?</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Note how John prioritizes relationships with other Christians over hoarding 
        material goods. </p>
      <p> Is this a valid excuse, or is it a statement of your priorities? What 
        are you willing to sacrifice for your spiritual growth? Keeping a time-log 
        will reveal how you really spend your time and perhaps clearly demonstrate 
        your priorities.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
 
  <p><i>5. Tribalism</i> (&quot;We are so busy with my children's [sports, music, 
    etc.] that we don't have time for fellowship.&quot; Or&quot;God first, my 
    family second, church third&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&quot; or &quot;My family 
    is my ministry&quot;).</p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Eph.&nbsp;5,6; Col.&nbsp;3 &#150; Paul speaks first of our identity as 
      brothers and sisters in the Body of Christ, and then addresses our various 
      social roles (including family roles). His point is that healthy family 
      life is based on and must be rooted in vital involvement in Christian fellowship. 
    </p>
    <p>The Bible does not set these priorities or dichotomize these two areas 
      of our lives. We should serve God in both contexts. Involvement in Body-life 
      is necessary for a healthy home, just as healthy home life affects our impact 
      on the Body of Christ.</p>
    <p>Qualifications: </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p> There may be times, particularly during family crises, where God calls 
        on us to reduce our normal involvement in ministry in the church in order 
        to take care of family needs (e.g. missing fellowship due to a child's 
        illness, or more long term crises).</p>
      <p> Even when we are considering structural changes during the life of our 
        church, this is taken into consideration.&nbsp; Many home groups have 
        changed to every other week to accommodate family ministry due to increased 
        family needs.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><i>6. Moral impurity </i>(Often manifested by withdrawal from fellowship 
    &amp;/or complaints about the church.) </p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>(1 Jn. 1:7)</b> &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but if we walk in the light 
      as He Himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
   
    <blockquote> 
      <p> Note the connection between close fellowship with other Christians and 
        responding to God's moral guidance. </p>
      <p> Sometimes, this is what keeps Christians from ever getting involved 
        in Body-life. Other times, this is why we leave fellowship or distance 
        ourselves from close relationships. &nbsp; Young Christian workers seem 
        to rarely consider this cause when a younger Christian they are working 
        with begins to withdraw.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
 
  <p><i>7. Rebellious attitude </i>(&quot;Who are you to tell me what to do/how 
    I should act?&quot;) </p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <strong>(Heb. 13:17)</strong> 17 Obey your leaders, and submit to them; 
      for they keep watch over your souls, as those who will give an account. 
      Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable 
      for you.</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p> This comes to light when leadership calls for change, or when other 
        Christians correct us.<small>&nbsp; </small>Whether or not we are rebellious 
        is determined not when we agree with authority figures, but when we disagree.&nbsp; 
        If we must have things our way, we have a problem (as long as the authority 
        is operating within the parameters of scripture). We should realize that 
        authority and discipline are expressions of love (for our benefit), rather 
        than tools to exploit us. </p>
      <p><b>(Heb.&nbsp;12:6,9,10)</b> Those whom the lord loves he disciplines, 
        and he scourges every son whom he receives&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; 
        (9) Furthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;(10) 
        they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but He disciplines 
        us for our good, that we may share His holiness.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> The author acknowledges that our earthly parents did not always deal 
          with us properly, but this is no excuse to refuse to submit to God's 
          discipline. Often times, rebelliousness is a reaction against unrighteous 
          authority figures (e.g. unfair or abusive parents, employers, etc.).&nbsp; 
          Authority figures can be unrighteous by being too permissive or too 
          strict.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>8. Shy or introverted</em> (&quot;I'm just shy and introverted.&quot; 
    &nbsp; &quot;I'm just not a people-person.&quot;)</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>(2 Tim 1:7)</b> For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of 
      power and love and discipline.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3><a NAME="a4">Spiritual Gifts</a> </h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>As we are involved in Body-life and practicing Christian love, God will eventually 
    reveal certain ministry strengths. These are called spiritual gifts. Scripture 
    teaches that all Christians have at least one spiritual gift (bestowed at 
    conversion). Gifts come in various combinations and degrees. <small>(1 Cor. 
    12; Rom. 12; Eph 4:7-11; 1 Pet. 4:8-11).</small></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>We shouldn't become obsessed with discovering our gift(s), as though doing 
      this is somehow the &quot;key&quot; to our spiritual life. Rather, we focus 
      on being involved with other Christians and practicing the &quot;one another&quot; 
      imperatives. We can rest assured that God will reveal our gifts. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>As we discover our spiritual gifts, we have opportunities to use these gifts 
    not only in the context of our closer fellowship relationships, but also with 
    people we do not know very well. In this way, we can build up the Body of 
    Christ.</p>
  <p>Xenos facilitates the discovery and deployment of our spiritual gifts. In 
    <a href="cpu4syl.htm">Unit Four</a> we will learn more about spiritual gifts. 
    Our Ministry Fair helps us find <a HREF="../../admin/minteam.htm">MINISTRY 
    TEAMS</a> which can utilize our gifts. It is not uncommon for people to be 
    involved in more than one ministry team. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="a5"></a>Discipleship </h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>As you learn about God and begin following him, he will give you the opportunity 
    to help younger, hungry Christians learn how to walk with him (Col.&nbsp;1:28,29; 
    2 Tim. 2:2). We call this ministry <a HREF="../leadership/discipleship.html">discipleship</a>. 
    This is one of the most exciting ministries God offers us, and we believe 
    that God calls all Christians to this ministry. </p>
  <p>In the context of a close (mentoring) relationship, we meet regularly (often 
    over several years) and practice the &quot;one another&quot; imperatives with 
    them. We are committed to helping them in their spiritual vitality, character 
    formation and ministry development. These folks often become some of our closest 
    friends, and eventually become our colleagues in ministry. </p>
  <p>NOTE: Healthy discipleship takes place within the context of involvement 
    with many other Christians. God normally uses many different Christians to 
    disciple us in different areas over a period of years. Beware of disciplers 
    who want to minimize your involvement with other Christians.</p>

      Instead, there are real tasks to accomplish through prayer in the lives

<h3><strong>Introduction </strong></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>While &quot;theology&quot; refers to the more general study of the biblical 
    worldview, &quot;theology proper&quot; refers to the specific study of God's 
    person and character. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a NAME="aa"></a>The Practical Importance of Theology Proper </h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>You must know God in order to relate to him.</b> This is not a sterile, 
    scholastic, abstract body of knowledge. <strong>If we understand who God is, 
    we should be awed by his greatness and goodness, and be motivated to worship 
    Him. Not only should we praise God for what he <i>does</i>, but also for who 
    he <i>is</i>! </strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong>(Ex. 33:18)</strong>&nbsp; Then Moses said, &quot;I pray Thee, show 
    me Thy glory!&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>(Ex. 34:6-8**)</strong> Then the LORD passed by in front of him and 
    proclaimed, &quot;The LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and gracious, slow 
    to anger, and abounding in lovingkindness and truth; (7) who keeps lovingkindness 
    for thousands, who forgives iniquity, transgression and sin; yet He will by 
    no means leave the guilty unpunished, visiting the iniquity of fathers on 
    the children and on the grandchildren to the third and fourth generations.&quot; 
    (8) And Moses made haste to bow low toward the earth and worship. </p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>This passage is in response to Moses' request ( Then Moses said, &quot;I 
      pray Thee, show me Thy glory!&quot;). Note that God's glory is revealed 
      not primarily in experiencing his power, but by understanding his character 
      revealed by his word. This is an important realization today when people 
      seek a subjective experience of God's power more than an understanding of 
      his character as revealed through scripture.</p>
    <p>e.g. In Rudolf Otto's influential book, <i>The Idea of the Holy</i>, he 
      argues that there is an experience of the numinous (the sense of the other) 
      that is the core of all religions. But this is too vague. Our sense of awe 
      is grounded in content that God has revealed about himself.</p>
    <p>God's self-distillation of his Person (in response to Moses' request in 
      Ex. 33:18) is that he is both righteous and gracious, both just and merciful. 
      These are the essence of who God is and both are good (33:19). Note Moses' 
      response . . . </p>
    <p><strong>Note: God's justice defines the dilemma between humans and God, 
      and his mercy is the way he resolves this dilemma</strong> &gt;&gt; NEXT 
      2 WEEKS In the cross God has found a way to be both just and the justifier 
      for mankind.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> &quot;Visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the 
      children&#133;&quot; see Ezekiel 18:14-20 (especially vs 20) and Exodus 
      20:4-6. The point is, <strong>sin can effect one's descendants, but each 
      person is responsible for their own sin. God will hold people accountable 
      for their sin in whatever generation they turn away from Him.</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><strong>We tend to humanize God. </strong>Unless we have a biblical view 
    of God and stay focused on him, our Christianity will tend to be humanistic: 
    done by our power and dependent only on human wisdom (see J. B. Phillips, 
    <i>Your God is Too Small</i>), but this calls for God's rebuke (Ps. 50:21 
    &quot; . . . you thought that I was just like you; I will reprove you . . 
    . &quot;). <br>
    That said, God's attributes are very helpful in their practical implications 
    for the Christian life (see below). His attributes are often relayed to us 
    in the Bible in very warm, human terms. &quot;God is pictured as a father, 
    a shepherd, a friend.&quot; (Erickson, <i>Christian Theology, </i>p.299)<br>
    Satan wants to distort your view of God so that your own walk will be hurt 
    and your communication about God to others will be distorted. Many religious 
    aberrations stem from this, as we shall see . . </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>We need to remember that today most people in our culture do not 
    believe in an infinite and personal God.</strong> We cannot assume that when 
    we use the word &quot;God,&quot; they are thinking of the God of the Bible. 
    When communicating to non-Christians about Christianity, we should realize 
    their need to understand the biblical view of God before they will appreciate 
    the Gospel. We should also understand the defective views of God. Even in 
    this class we should realize many of us are bringing views of God that are 
    profoundly unbiblical.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a NAME="ab">Contrasting Views of God</a></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Before we study the God of the Bible in more detail, we will briefly examine 
    contrasting views of God or ultimate reality. Most people's view of ultimate 
    reality is an amalgam of many of these views. What follows is a brief overview 
    of several views of God: </p>
 
  <ul>
    <li> <strong>Monotheism (also called &quot;theism&quot;): </strong></li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p>There is one infinite-personal-righteous God. This view of God is found 
        only among religions which are based on the Bible. Judaism and Islam are 
        both monotheistic, but differ from Christianity in many important areas. 
        In this system, man's dilemma is true moral guilt before a righteous God. 
        Our guilt requires cleansing or forgiveness. </p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li> <strong>Deism:</strong> </li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Deists recognize that a Supreme Being exists who created the universe,

        This view is also called &quot;naturalism,&quot; emphasizing its denial

      <p>Spirits inhabit animate and inanimate matter. They are the cause of most 
        good and ill fortune, and humans must placate them or control them to 
        succeed in life. Most tribal religions (including Native American spirituality) 
        are animistic. Most animism is occultic in the sense that humans can control 
        the spirit world through attaining certain knowledge, sympathetic ritual, 
        etc. Man's problem: placating and controlling the spirits. Solution: ritual 
        sacrifice, occultism, sympathetic magic, etc.<br>
        Note: Some anthropologists believe that human religions &quot;devolved&quot;

      <p>There are many personal (but not infinite) gods. The Greek and Roman 
        pantheons are well-known examples of polytheism. This belief appears to 
        be a projection of human characteristics (including limitations and character

      <p>God is the impersonal life-force that permeates the world. God is infinite, 
        yet impersonal. Ultimate reality is oneness; all distinctions (including 
        persons) are illusory. Classical Hinduism and Buddhism are well-known 
        examples of pantheism. Western notions of the ultimate state in pantheistic 
        religions is often mistaken. Nirvana (Buddhist) and Moksha (Hindu) are

    <li> <strong>Dualism: </strong></li>
  </ul>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Ultimate reality is equal opposing forces or persons. Dualism recognizes 
        the moral and personal distinctions that pantheism denies, but elevates 
        them to ultimate reality. For example, Zoroastrianism (Ahriman and Ohrmazd 
        were opposing persons). Some people think of Christianity this way with 
        Satan and Jesus as the equal and opposing persons. Taoism's yin and yang, 
        and Star Wars' &quot;The Force&quot; are examples of theological dualism. 
        The problem in Dualism is imbalance between forces and the solution is 
        balancing forces. We see this today in some forms of Alternative medicine 
        in which the medical problem is thought to center on an imbalanced energy 
        field (Therapeutic Touch, Ayurvedic Medicine). </p>

      <p><strong>Note: </strong>An ecological spirituality often flows out of

      <p>Ultimate reality is purely a matter of individual/social perception. 
        There is nothing &quot;out there&quot; independent of human/social construction. 
        Therefore, western monotheism and eastern pantheism, though logically 
        contradictory, are mutually &quot;true&quot; in the sense that they are 
        the paradigms through which different society's construct reality. It 
        should be obvious why this view is more sympathetic to eastern religions 
        (which assert that all religions are imperfect attempts to describe ultimate

<h3><a NAME="a1"></a>The Self-Revelation of God </h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Definitions: </strong></p>
 
  <ul>
    <li> <strong>Revelation vs. Speculation:</strong> God communicating about 
      himself to us vs. Humans' thoughts about God. Except for monotheism, the 
      above views are largely speculation. </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li> <strong>General vs Special Revelation:</strong> General: (a) what God 
      has revealed about himself to <i>all</i> people, (b) by nature it is less 
      detailed, (c) revealed through creation and our own makeup. Special: (a) 
      what God has revealed about himself and his purpose to <i>some individuals</i>, 
      (b) more detailed, (c) which is available to us through scripture.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What can be known from general revelation? </strong>Several biblical 
      passages, including Romans 1 and 2, tell us that certain facts about God 
      may be learned from observing his creation. </li>
  </ul>
  &nbsp;
<blockquote>
    <p>(<strong>Rom. 1:19-20</strong>) since what may be known about God is plain 
      to them, because God has made it plain to them. (20) For since the creation 
      of the world God's invisible qualities&#151;his eternal power and divine 
      nature&#151;have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been 
      made, so that men are without excuse. </p>
    <p>See also Psalm 19.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li> 
        <p><strong>God is intelligent.</strong> This is inferred from design in 
          creation. (Rom. 1:19,20). </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li> 
        <p><strong>God is powerful. </strong>This is inferred from the immensity 
          of creation (Rom. 1:20). God must be bigger and more powerful than creation 
          because he brought it into being and sustains it. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li> <strong>God is eternal.</strong> This is also inferred from creation. 
        God predates creation (Rom. 1:20). He must be the uncaused Cause for there 
        to be a creation. </li>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><strong>(Rom. 2:14-15) </strong>Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have 
          the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for 
          themselves, even though they do not have the law, (15) since they show 
          that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their 
          consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts now accusing, now 
          even defending them. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <li> 
        <p><strong>God is moral.</strong> This is inferred from the moral conscience 
          universally present in humans (Rom. 2:14,15). </p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p><strong>God is personal.</strong> We instinctively and intuitively 
          value our personhood. (Could personality come from divine impersonality?) 
          &#151; Genesis 1,2.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Note: </strong>Therefore, <strong>the honest person without access 
    to the Bible will <i>not</i> be a devout animist, pantheist, etc</strong>. 
    Paul says <strong>they know enough about the true God from general revelation 
    to be justly judged for idolatry.</strong> We must resist the popular idea 
    that people's religious beliefs are determined by their religious environment. 
    While this may be a strong influence, God says he has revealed himself sufficiently 
    through nature and conscience so that honest people will realize that their 
    (non-biblical) religious environment is false or inadequate. Many testimonies 
    from the mission field confirm this. </p>
 
  <p><strong>What are the limitations of general revelation?</strong> (More on 
    this in <a href="cpu4_evang_2.htm">Unit #4 Week 5)</a> </p>
 
  <ul>
    <li> <strong>We cannot learn about salvation from general revelation.</strong> 
      We can infer that God is moral and that we fall short, but we can't know 
      <i>if</i> he has a plan of forgiveness, or <i>what</i> that plan is if he 
      has one. This all comes from special revelation. </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li> <strong>We could easily question God's goodness apart from special revelation.</strong> 
      Without knowledge of the Fall (special revelation), we could easily conclude 
      that humans and nature are in their normal state. What does this tell us 
      about the Creator? </li>

<h3><a NAME="a2"></a>Special Revelation: The Unity &amp; Diversity Of God </h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong>What is the Trinity? </strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Three in person, one in essence:</strong> God exists as three 
      distinguishable persons, but is one and inseparable in his being, divine 
      nature, and purpose. Tri-unity, a threeness and a oneness. Three persons 
      who have different roles in God's redemptive plan but who share the same 
      attributes, purpose, and love for each other. <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>This is different than saying that God is one person who manifests himself 
      in three different modes (MODALISM). Rather, <strong>God exists simultaneously 
      as three different persons</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>Example of modalism:</strong> ONE PERSON PLAYING DIFFERENT ROLES: 
      The same person may function as a supervisor, husband, or father depending 
      on the situation. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The trinity is incomprehensible, but not logically contradictory 
      or irrational.</strong> Critics who claim that the trinity is the same as 
      saying &quot;3 = 1&quot; are wrong, because the &quot;threeness&quot; has 
      to do with personhood, while the &quot;oneness&quot; has to do with essence.</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>(Erickson)</strong> &quot;Those aspects of God which we never fully 
      comprehend should be regarded as mysteries that go beyond our reason rather 
      than as paradoxes which conflict with reason.&quot; Erickson, <i>Christian 
      Theology</i>, p. 338 </p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Most of us are not able to explain how a Xerox 
      copier works, but that doesn't mean it is logically absurd.</p>
    <p><b>Example:</b> To a two dimensional being, a three dimensional object 
      like a cube would be incomprehensible. The cube can objectively exist, but 
      it's presence is difficult for a two dimensional being to detect or grasp.

    before the fall (love, veracity). These categories help us, as finite beings, 
    understand God. These attributes are interrelated (e.g. God exercises his 
    power in a way that's consistent with his love and justice). </p>
 
  <p>We err when we anthropomorphize God and also when we view God as impassive

  <p><strong>Loving (Common) </strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>Definition: </strong>As God's love is expressed toward humanity, 
      it means that God always views humanity with compassion and acts for its 
      best interest. </p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> We cannot use God's love to erase his other attributes&#151;like 
      his justice (see Ex. 34:6-8). <i>CONTRA</i> UNIVERSALISTS </p>
    <p><strong>Scriptural Evidence: </strong>(1 Jn. 4:8,16; Isaiah 30:18-21;49:14-16) 
      His proper name Yahweh is associated with his goodness grace and compassion 
      (Ex. 33:17-20; Joel 2:13;Psalm 86:15). In Exodus 34:14 he calls himself 
      Yahweh whose name is &quot;Qanna&quot;. Quanna is used only five times in 
      scripture and solely of God in the context of idolatry. This is the attitude 
      of a lover who wants the loyalty of the one to whom he's bound himself to 
      honor and serve.</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><b>(1 Jn. 4:8,16)</b> Whoever does not love does not know God, because 
        God is love&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.(16) &nbsp;And so we know and rely on

    <p><strong>Application: </strong></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><strong>Never pit God's will against your good or other people's good.</strong> 
        The issue is how to attain this good: my way or God's way. When we disobey

      <p><strong>We can trust God, even when he is disciplining us. </strong>He 
        is always actively involved in our lives for our good (Heb. 12:4,5). (DISCIPLINE 
        vs. RETRIBUTION) </p>
      <p><strong>There is no reason to be afraid of God as believers.</strong> 
        While we should respect him, we need never fear his rejection or retribution. 
        Deut. 10:12,13 defines &quot;fear of God&quot; in the proper sense. </p>

          An atheist may be morally minded, but he just happens to be living better

          moral values, but he cannot have any sense of compelling and universal

      <p><strong>We could never work our way to God. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>When we want to be sanctified in our lives, we should look to 
        God's character.</strong> Even though others can disciple us and be models

        always need to look ultimately to Christ himself. Look also at the Fruit

        others may see your progress.&quot;) </p>

    <p><strong>Scriptural Evidence: </strong>(Ex. 3:14; Jn. 8:58; Isa. 40:28; 
      Acts 17:25) </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><b>(Ex.&nbsp;3:14)</b> God said to Moses, &quot;I AM WHO I AM. This is 
        what you are to say to the Israelites: 'I AM has sent me to you.'&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Application: </strong></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><strong>God cannot be manipulated by his creation, because he is not 
        dependent on it.</strong> This undercuts the basis of occultic magic and 
        chants. </p>
      <p><strong>The essence of sin is to not acknowledge your dependence upon 
        God</strong> (Gen. 3:6; Isa. 14:14). </p>
      <p><strong>HUMAN AGENCY should never be understood to mean that God needs 
        man. </strong>God doesn't need us to love him, to minister for him, to 
        give him money, etc. These are <i>privileges</i> of grace. </p>
      <p><strong>The postmodern view that God's existence and nature are ultimately 
        subjective (individual's or culture's perception) is false.</strong> God 
        exists objectively and is the way he is completely apart from our perception 
        of him (like gravity). The value of our beliefs about God is not that 
        they create him, but (hopefully) that they correspond to the way he really 
        is. </p>

  <p><strong>Just (common)</strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> God does what his righteousness demands (reward, 
      punishment, deliverance). His justice operates retributively only towards

      in him.</p>
    <p><strong>Scriptural Evidence: </strong>(Rom. 2:1-5; Gen. 18:25; Ps. 19:9) 
    </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><b>(Rom.&nbsp;2:2,5)</b> Now we know that God's judgment against those

      <p><b>(Gen.&nbsp;18:25)</b> Far be it from you to do such a thing&#151;to kill

        Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Application: </strong></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><strong>We should never ask God to give us &quot;what I deserve.&quot; 
        </strong>The moment that you sin the first time, you forfeit forever any 
        chance for justice to operate toward you in a positive way (LIKE NAZI 
        WAR CRIMINALS AT NUREMBURG DEMANDING JUSTICE). WHAT ABOUT REWARDS? This 
        should be seen as &quot;grace upon grace.&quot; </p>
      <p><strong>To avenge another in interpersonal relationships is to usurp 
        God's role</strong> (Rom. 12:14,17,19). This is why all bitterness is 
        wrong (as well as because God has dealt with us under grace [Eph 4:32]). 
        It is therefore not proper to speak of justice/rights within interpersonal 
        relationships.</p>
      <p>God wants to hear about your worries and frustrations, but not at the 
        expense of faith in his justice. (e.g. Psalm 73) God often is on a different 
        timetable for executing his justice than we would prefer. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Legal/civil justice is valid, but it is always 
        partial and imperfect, and left to the civil authorities to execute (Rom.

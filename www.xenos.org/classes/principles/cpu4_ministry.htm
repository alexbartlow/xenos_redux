<blockquote>
  <h4>Moving Into Ministry <br>
    <br>
    Luke 9:24 &quot;For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it, but whoever 
    loses his life for My sake, he is the one who will save it. (This is repeated 
    many times by Jesus [Mt 10:39; 16:25; Mk. 8:35; Lk. 17:33; Jn 12:25 and in 
    Acts 20:35)<br>
  </h4>
  <h4>Antithesis: Christianity as self-improvement-personal empowerment<br>
  </h4>
  <h4>Jesus us talking about being convinced from the heart about a lifestyle 
    of giving-giving our life away. Being convinced that that is the KEY to fulfillment 
    in life</h4>
  <h4>What happens when you don't pursue this way of life? The word becomes dry, 
    you experience lack of direction and purpose, etc.</h4>
  <h4>Have you decided which set of values you will pursue?</h4>
</blockquote>
<h3>Uniformity in Ministry (these are like &quot;fundamentals&quot; in sports)<a name="Uniformity"></a><br>
</h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The ideal is being a <b>team player</b> who is <b>fundamentally sound</b>; 
    then on that basis we could specialize. God has designed each of us uniquely, 
    but also calls on our regular, consistent, and committed efforts in certain 
    areas <b>regardless of our gifts, burdens, or personality traits.</b> </p>
  <p>The main idea: <i>evangelism and discipleship in context of community</i><br>
  </p>
  <p><b>What are the areas of ministry uniformity (areas of ministry we have in 
    common)?</b> THIS WILL BE ON THE EXAM!<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><b>Intercessory Prayer</b> (Col. 4:2; Eph. 6:18) (Unit 3) </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Evangelism</b> (1 Pet. 2:9; 1 Pet. 3:15; Col. 3:17-4:1; 1 Pet. 2:12-3:7; 
    Titus 2:7-3:8; 1 Tim. 6:1,2) (Unit 4)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Missions</b> (Matt. 28:19 of all nations; Acts 1:8) (earlier in Unit 
    4)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Discipleship</b> (Mt. 28:19; see also 2 Tim. 2:2) </li>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Nothing could be more natural than for me to assume responsibility for 
      helping younger Christians grow. Young. Think in terms of a perpetual day 
      care center vs. a healthy family where all have responsibilities. Discipleship 
      could take a lot of forms: with other leaders in a cell; one on one...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <li><b>&quot;Love one another&quot;</b> (Jn. 13:34) as unpacked by the New Testament 
    &quot;one another&quot; passages (see Rom. 12:10,15; 15:7; Gal. 6:2; Eph. 
    4:2; Col. 3:13; 1 Thess. 5:14; Heb. 10:24,25; Jas. 5:16). </li>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> Jesus stresses that it is the underlying ministry that will enable us 
      to succeed at the above ministries. Do we serve others? (more in Unit 3)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <li><b>Financial giving </b>(Lk. 12:33,34; Gal. 6:6; Eph. 4:28; 1 Cor. 9:14; 
    1 Tim. 5:17,18). As stewards of God's money and material possessions, we are 
    all responsible to use these things to advance his kingdom, as well as your 
    own needs. (Unit 4) <br>
    <p>It is disastrous to view any of these as options! We live in a culture 
      that tends to specialize. Little value is given to being a generalist. We 
      need to remain involved in these areas regardless of our area of ministry 
      focus. We have to allow time for these provisions in our schedule-and sometimes 
      in our heart. <br>
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="diversity"></a>Diversity in Ministry: Spiritual Gifts <br>
</h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2"><b>(1 Cor. 12:4-6)</b> Now there are varieties of gifts, but 
    the same Spirit. (5) And there are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord. 
    (6) And there are varieties of effects, but the same God who works all things 
    in all persons. (See also ROM 12:6-8; 1 Pet. 4:8-11; Eph 4:7-16)</font></p>
  <p><b>(DIVERSITY OF) Gifts</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>DEFINITION</b>: God-given capabilities to serve others so that they 
      are impacted for and/or built up spiritually in Jesus Christ. <br>
      Every Christian has at least one spiritual gift <br>
    </p>
    <p><b>(<font size="2">1 Cor. 12:7,11)</font></b><font size="2"> But to each 
      one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. . . (11) 
      But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each 
      one individually just as He wills. </font><br>
    </p>
    <p>None of the passages concerning spiritual gifts are meant to provide an 
      exhaustive list, but the focus is on how to use the gifts (E.G. with diligence, 
      with love, etc.).</p>
    <p>One of your handouts includes definitions of these gifts along with distinctives 
      to help you recognize gifts in yourself or others. The handout also provides 
      cautions-areas where sanctification is often challenged in people with that 
      gift. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Tonight, we will not define every spiritual gift. The Ministry Assessment 
      Materials provide definitions of most spiritual gifts. (spgifts.htm). Download 
      spgifts.rtf. <br>
    </p>
    <p>*Note: We should view spiritual gifts as special areas of aptitude, and 
      not as limits on our capability to serve (i.e. the evangelist is not the 
      only one to evangelize).</p>

  <p><b>(DIVERSITY OF) Ministries</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Ministry - The use of spiritual gifts to serve others.</p>
    <p>We tend use the word ministry in two ways:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1. Ministry is <b>what you do</b>-- the act of exercising your gift.. 
        For example, you may develop a hospitality ministry by helping newer people 
        feel welcomed and part of the group and hosting events.<br>
      </p>
      <p>2. Ministry can refer to <b>the sphere in which you serve</b>, the group 
        of people among whom you exercise your gifts in service. Examples of ministry 
        spheres might include a junior high cell group, a home church, or a group 
        of terminally ill patients.<br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>(DIVERSITY OF) Effects </b><br>
  </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Effects are <b>the outcome of our ministries</b>. We bear spiritual fruit 
      in ministry as we impact people for Christ. <br>
    </p>
    <p>In the Body of Christ, <b>some</b> will have a more <b>visible, dramatic 
      effect </b>while others' ministry fruit may be less obvious (from our perspective, 
      not God's). THIS HELPS US NOT COMPARE WITH OTHERS<br>
    </p>
    <p>IT'S VERY EXCITING THAT GOD HAS SUITED YOU AND I UNIQUELY TO A ROLE IN 
      HIS PURPOSE! <br>

<h3><a name="important"></a>Why it is Important to Discover and Exercise your 
  Gifts<a name="#Important"></a></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <h4>Discovering and exercising your gift(s):<br>
  </h4>
  <p><b>1. Gives you a greater sense of significance and purpose for your Christian 
    life.</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">(2 Timothy 4:6-8) 6 For I am already being poured out as 
      a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come. 7 I have fought 
      the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith; 8 in 
      the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the 
      Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to 
      me, but also to all who have loved His appearing. </font></p>
    <p>You will share the sense of purpose that Paul had in this passage as God 
      progressively clarifies your unique role. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>2. Provides more insight into God's will for your life.</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>It is God's will for you to exercise and develop your gift(s). As you do 
      so, there will be many practical implications for decision-making in your 
      life. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3. Provides additional motivation toward spiritual growth.</b> <br>
  </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Why did I turn away from the world? &quot;Because it's a rush to teach.&quot; 
      This has been called the &quot;Expulsive power of a New Affection.&quot;<br>
    </p>
    <p>Also, it is much easier to resist sin when we replace it with the stimulation 
      of ministry. As this happens, you will find greater resistance to the seduction 
      of the world (1 Jn. 2:15,16), which is only a counterfeit to the real purpose 
      for your life.<br>
    </p>
    <p>It is difficult to maintain motivation in our sanctification unless we 
      see the purpose for it. <br>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>4. Lets you experience more consistently and to a greater degree the power 
    of the Holy Spirit.<br>
    </b> </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>This is one of the features of gifting-the Holy Spirit often empowers you 
      with special intensity as you serve in that area. This helps you overcome 
      fearfulness and timidity in your service for Christ. When you serve according 
      to your gifts, you gain confidence in God because you see Him at work in 
      your ministry. This confidence permeates other areas of your Christian life. 
    </p>
    <p><font size="2">(2 Tim 1:6-9) And for this reason I remind you to kindle 
      afresh the gift of God which was given to you by the laying on of my hands. 
      For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and 
      discipline. Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, or 
      of me His prisoner; but join with me in suffering for the gospel according 
      to the power of God, who has saved us and called us with a holy calling 
      not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which 
      was granted to us in Christ Jesus from all eternity.</font><br>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>5. Frees you from making unhealthy comparisons to others and increases 
    healthy interdependence within the Body of Christ.</b><br>
  </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The devil really likes to alienate us from each other by getting us to 
      compare. The more you discover and develop the unique contribution that 
      you have, the easier it is to be grateful for the contribution of others. 
      This minimizes carnal competition. <br>
    </p>
    <p><font size="2">See 1 Cor 12:14-26 -- For the body is not one member, but 
      many. 15 If the foot should say, &quot;Because I am not a hand, I am not 
      a part of the body,&quot; it is not for this reason any the less a part 
      of the body. 16 And if the ear should say, &quot;Because I am not an eye, 
      I am not a part of the body,&quot; it is not for this reason any the less 
      a part of the body. 17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing 
      be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be? 18 But 
      now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, just as He 
      desired. 19 And if they were all one member, where would the body be? 20 
      But now there are many members, but one body. 21 And the eye cannot say 
      to the hand, &quot;I have no need of you&quot;; or again the head to the 
      feet, &quot;I have no need of you.&quot; 22 On the contrary, it is much 
      truer that the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary; 
      23 and those members of the body, which we deem less honorable, on these 
      we bestow more abundant honor, and our unseemly members come to have more 
      abundant seemliness, 24 whereas our seemly members have no need of it. But 
      God has so composed the body, giving more abundant honor to that member 
      which lacked, 25 that there should be no division in the body, but that 
      the members should have the same care for one another. 26 And if one member 
      suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the 
      members rejoice with it.</font><br>
    </p>
    <p>As you exercise your gift, you appreciate the genius of God's design of 
      the body of Christ: everyone has an important contribution to make. As a 
      result, you are more likely to seek out and receive the contribution that 
      others have been gifted to make. You realize &quot;I can't do it all. I 
      need others...&quot;<br>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3><a name="discover"></a>Ways to discover your spiritual gifts </h3>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> It seems that there is no specific method for discovering spiritual gifts. 
      Instead, God emphasizes certain principles that we employ as we live in 
      the Body of Christ. As we live and function in the Body of Christ our gifts 
      emerge. <br>
    </p>
    <p><b>1. Ask God to reveal your gifts</b> </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Remember that God has sovereignly given you the gift(s) that you have. 
        Affirm that he has gifted you for a unique and significant role, and submit 
        in advance to whatever role he has chosen for you. Then ask him to reveal 
        your role to you as you step out in faith to find it. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>2. Become a servant</b>. (IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO SERVE, WHY SHOULD 
      GOD SHOW YOU YOUR GIFT?)<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="2">Mark 10:45 For even the Son of Man did not come to be 
        served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Philippians 2:3-5 Do nothing from selfishness or empty 
        conceit, but with humility of mind let each of you regard one another 
        as more important than himself; 4 do not merely look out for your own 
        personal interests, but also for the interests of others. 5 Have this 
        attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Ephesians 4:11,12 It was he who gave some to be apostles, 
        some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and 
        teachers, 12 to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the 
        body of Christ may be built up</font></p>
      <p>God laid his life down to meet our needs. He commands us to follow his 
        example, by expending ourselves in the service of others within the framework 
        of the Body of Christ. As we serve, our gifting is manifest. Over time 
        you have probably become aware of different needs/ tasks in home church 
        that are being overlooked (e.g. organizing a retreat, cleaning up after 
        HC, encouraging a new person, etc.). As you make various attempts to serve, 
        some efforts will be fruitful and others won't. Through feedback from 
        others and the result of your efforts, God will open your eyes to unique 
        areas of gifting that you may have. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Because servanthood is such and important area, we should carefully distinguish 
        it from its antithesis, selfishness. The chart below contrasts a servant 
        attitude with a selfish attitude:<br>

            he was God's servant, and because there was no other way to rescue 
            the people he loved. How do you respond when God contradicts your 
            agenda with the needs of others? Sacrificing our time and energy for 
            the good of others might be painful at times-yet it leads to life

    <p><b>3. Develop foundational ministry skills in your home group</b>.<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Recall the importance of areas of ministry uniformity, including &quot;loving 
        one another&quot; in the context of Christian community. We should prioritize 
        developing ministry skills in our home group over getting involved in 
        various ministries in the church at large. So it begins with Home Church, 
        but eventually goes beyond. SEEK TO BE AN EDIFYING FORCE IN THE HOME GROUP.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><br>
      <b>4. Take steps of faith to try new ministries.</b></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Sometimes we are pushed into a ministry by the need. </p>
      <p>Having a gift does not mean you won't be scared to step up.</p>
      <p>Flowing from the first four, the next four are reflective:<br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>5. What kinds of ministry do you especially enjoy doing?</b></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Phil. 2:13 says that God is at work in you both to create the desire 
        for and to give you the empowering for his good pleasure-that is, for 
        his unique purpose for your life. This promise encompasses God's ministry 
        purpose for your life as well as his moral purpose (sanctification). Therefore, 
        it is appropriate to ask yourself, &quot;What areas of ministry are especially 
        appealing to me?&quot; What would I like to do for the Lord if I could 
        do anything for him? </p>
      <p>Remember the variety of gifts that God has given. Resist the tendency 
        to assume that you must be gifted like &quot;so and so&quot; in order 
        to be significant, or that if you really would like to minister in a certain 
        area, it must not be God's will. <br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>6. What kinds of ministry needs do you consistently notice?</b><br>
    </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Gifting often affects our perception of ministry needs. Ask God to open 
        your eyes to the needs that exist around you. Look especially within your 
        own home group, but also look beyond it to the fellowship as a whole and 
        the local and global community. Are there certain kinds of needs that 
        you tend to consistently see? </p>
      <p>Aptitude often affects our perception of a situation; we tend to be most 
        aware of those needs that we are most suited to meet. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>7. What kinds of ministry do you experience consistent empowering for?</b></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>&quot;I sensed God working through me.&quot; Gifting is spiritual empowerment, 
        which is partially experiential. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>8. What kinds of ministry are you effective in (others' feedback; fruit)?</b><br>
    </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>What unsolicited feedback do you receive from others? </p>
      <p>When a pattern emerges of people telling you that God builds them up 
        through you in a certain area, this is a reliable indicator of gifting. 
        On the other hand, we will experience setbacks in areas of gifting so 
        be careful not to give up prematurely.</p>
      <p>Start looking at others from the perspective of how God has gifted them. 
        Put some thought in on how they might be gifted; let them know when you 
        see them being effective with you or others. This creates an environment 
        much more conducive to the discovery of gifts</p>

<h3><a name="fulfill"></a>Fulfillment in Ministry</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Teachers</b>: do some autobiographical stuff about why you are thriving 
    in the work of God -- both failures and successes. Tell them why you have 
    stuck with it despite the hardships.</p>
  <p>Everyone wants a fulfilling life. Many Christians have not yet experienced 
    fulfillment in ministry.<br>
  </p>
  <p><b>What is fulfillment?</b> Fulfillment is a deep-seated sense of blessing/ 
    joy arising from total commitment to something significant. This is what we 
    were designed for. Total commitment to God's purposes.</p>
  <p>All of us are committed to something. We have to consider, &quot;What am 
    I committed to?&quot; In the US it's the &quot;me first law.&quot; We learn 
    to value and seek our personal interests above any other values. We've learned 
    that the biblical world view is dramatically different.<br>
  </p>
  <p><font size="2"><b>1 Cor. 9:23-27</b> And I do all things for the sake of 
    the gospel, that I may become a fellow partaker of it. (24) Do you not know 
    that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize? Run 
    in such a way that you may win. (25) And everyone who competes in the games 
    exercises self-control in all things. They then do it to receive a perishable 
    wreath, but we an imperishable. (26) Therefore I run in such a way, as not 
    without aim; I box in such a way, as not beating the air; (27) but I buffet 
    my body and make it my slave, lest possibly, after I have preached to others, 
    I myself should be disqualified.</font><br>
  </p>
  <p>We reach this point gradually as led by God. He gifts us and empowers us 
    to serve effectively. It's not like being committed to ballet, but without 
    talent. God provides the talent and part of our spiritual growth process entails 
    learning that we are inadequate to serve him apart from his empowering.<br>
  </p>
  <p><font size="2"><b>2 Cor. 3:5-6a</b> Not that we are adequate in ourselves 
    to consider anything as coming from ourselves, but our adequacy is from God, 
    6 who also made us adequate as servants of a new covenant...</font><br>
  </p>
  <p>The joy offered by Christ, as we align our will with His, far exceeds any 
    worldly attempt for joy.<br>
  </p>
  <p><font size="2"><b>John 10:10</b> ...I came that you might have life and have 
    it abundantly.</font><br>
  </p>
  <p><font size="2"><b>Phil 3:7,8</b> But whatever things were gain to me, those 
    things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ. 8 More than that, I 
    count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ 
    Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count

  <li>We shouldn't be committed to pursuing fulfillment as an end to itself. </li>
  <li>Joy, in the modern sense, is often absent. Loving others can be painful 
    at times. </li>
  <li>Our own selfish motives can rob us of the joy/ fulfillment of serving others.

    <p><font size="2">(Luke 6:46-49) &quot;And why do you call Me, 'Lord, Lord,' 
      and do not do what I say? 47 &quot;Everyone who comes to Me, and hears My 
      words, and acts upon them, I will show you whom he is like: 48 he is like 
      a man building a house, who dug deep and laid a foundation upon the rock; 
      and when a flood rose, the torrent burst against that house and could not 
      shake it, because it had been well built. 49 &quot;But the one who has heard, 
      and has not acted accordingly, is like a man who built a house upon the 
      ground without any foundation; and the torrent burst against it and immediately 
      it collapsed, and the ruin of that house was great.&quot;</font></p>

<h3><strong><font face="Arial" size="3">Introduction </font></strong></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Review relationships involving indicative 
    &amp; imperatives (it's really one dynamic - imperative is always based on 
    the indicative. This provides the basis for proper motives, etc. But an additional 
    relationship to this dynamic is that our &quot;experience&quot; is based on 
    proper outworking of that dynamic). It is important that we see in both relationships 
    the indicatives are unconditionally given to us by God. But the &quot;experience&quot; 
    is a different aspect&#151;it is the benefit that God often offers to us as 
    affirmation of the truth of the indicatives and the reality of him in our 
    life. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&quot;Who are you?&quot; We all have 
    a sense of identity, of &quot;who we are&quot;. Much of it was developed in 
    our upbringing, much also contributed to by our education, but also much from 
    our deciding &quot;who we wanted to be.&quot; Commonly, this is defined in 
    functional terms, &quot;I want to be an attorney.&quot; &quot;I want to be 
    a father.&quot; &quot;I want to be a wife.&quot; Naturally we have taken on 
    a sense of identity that is usually multifaceted. The point is, our actions 
    come from that sense of identity, not the other way around. As an attorney, 
    we do certain things, etc. The connection between our identity and our actions 
    is an aspect of how we are designed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Read 2 Cor. 5:17. Tonight we want to 
    explore the importance of our new identity in some detail. Understanding this 
    is the foundation for growth. What Jesus did in John 13 when he washed the 
    disciples' feet flowed from his affirmation of his identity before God. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">John 13:1,3 <font size="2">Now before 
      the Feast of the Passover, Jesus knowing that His hour had come... knowing 
      that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come 
      forth from God, and was going back to God.<br>
      </font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">See also 1 John 4:16-19 <font size="2">And 
      we have come to know and have believed the love which God has for us. God 
      is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in 
      him. 17 By this, love is perfected with us, that we may have confidence 
      in the day of judgment; because as He is, so also are we in this world. 
      18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear 
      involves punishment, and the one who fears is not perfected in love. 19 
      We love, because He first loved us.</font></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Warning: This is &quot;meat&quot;&#151;it 
    is difficult to digest, but also yields tremendous benefits in your spiritual 
    life. We're going to start with abstract stuff, and get more practical as 
    we go. </font></li>

<h3><strong><font face="Arial" size="3">Union with Christ </font></strong></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Our new identity is one part of the 
    foundational indicative truth concerning sanctification: our union with Christ. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Read 1 Cor. 12:13 </font><font size="2">For 
    by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks,

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> Illustration: While visiting downtown 
      Manaus (Brazil) one evening, I noticed a pack of young boys picking pockets, 
      stealing from shops, etc. When I asked a native about these boys, he replied 
      &quot;Oh, those are the 'throw-away' kids.&quot; These children were abandoned 
      downtown by their parents, and left to survive on their own. They (correctly) 
      viewed themselves as throwaway children, so they stole to survive. Suppose 
      I adopted one of those children and took him home with me. If I took him 
      with me to the grocery store the next day, I wouldn't be surprised if he 
      stole food and stuffed it under his shirt. <em>Until </em>he really understood 
      and believed that his identity had changed (from a throwaway kid to my son), 
      he would probably continue to act as if he didn't have two parents to care 
      for him; once he understood his new identity as a child of loving, caring 
      parents, he would look to us for his provision and his action of stealing 
      would cease.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Examples: If I take my identity from 
      my <i>profession</i>, my behavior will reflect this by the hours I spend

      nice things becomes paramount. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Illustration: Bruce Wilkinson, 
        when teaching at a new college for the first time, was told by an older 
        faculty member that one of his three sections of Bible Study Methods was 
        designated for the top incoming freshmen - Section 2. The faculty member 
        said, &quot;I can't believe they gave you section 2. You're the rookie 
        teacher. They are incredible to teach. They are so motivated and sharp.&quot; 
        Sure enough, while he thought sections 1 &amp; 3 were good, section 2 
        was electric. The lecture was the same but the difference was night and 
        day. He looked forward to this class every time he taught it. The grades 
        and the quality of their work in and out of class was remarkably different. 
        There was just one wrinkle. That year, they didn't put the sharpest students 
        in section 2. Section 2 was the same composition as the other two sections. 
        This phenomenon is well known to educators and controlled studies have 
        shown the very same effect. How we perceive others has a remarkable affect 
        on how they behave.<br>

        Note: It is important to qualify that lacking such a friend with this 
        kind of view of you is no excuse for you not growing nor is failure of 
        your friend to grow your fault. The point is simply that thinking God's

        of talking to yourself? Take those thoughts that come to you the moment 
        you wake up in the morning. You have not originated them, but they start 
        talking to you, they bring back the problems of yesterday, etc. Somebody 
        is talking. Who is talking to you? Your self is talking to you. Now this 
        man's treatment was this; instead of allowing this self to talk to him, 
        he starts talking to himself. 'Why art thou cast down, O my soul?' he 
        asks. His soul had been depressing him, crushing him. So he stands up

      many of us continue to live as slaves, not because we don't know this truth, 
      but because we don't choose against our feelings and previous experience 
      to believe it? If we passively respond, our &quot;knowing&quot; will not 
      profit us. </font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This is why every day, we should 
        consciously recall and remind ourselves of what is true about us in this 
        area: &quot;I am free from sin's authority and therefore able to change.&quot; 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This is why especially when we 
        are confronted by evidence to the contrary through failure, accusation, 
        etc., it is so important to choose to reject that conclusion and instead 
        agree with God that &quot;he has set me free from sin's authority and 
        that his power is progressively changing my life as I continue to believe 
        what he says and cooperate with him.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is also essential, when helping 
        Christians who are struggling in a sin area, to help them consider how 
        their new identity specifically applies to the area and what lies about 
        their identity they were believing.&nbsp; Not counseling in this manner 
        will lead to a legalistic approach to their change.</font></p>

      their memories, etc.&#151;and what else? Who actually began to refuse the

      of the plantations and put themselves in places where the power of the government

        finally, who on that basis choose not to submit to moral defeat in their 
        lives and instead <em>present</em> themselves to God in ways that allow 
        his power to change their lives. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Other Examples: </font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">You are angry with a person for 
        not paying enough attention to you. The fact is that they ARE being unloving 
        and insensitive. At a teaching, you learn (<em>Know</em>) that God will 
        meet all of your love needs and that we should therefore not look to other 
        people to do this. Realizing that this is what you have been doing, you 
        choose to affirm that God will provide for you in this area (<em>Consider</em>). 
        Now what would it look like to <em>present</em> ourselves based on this 
        identity truth? (choose not to lash out or punish with silence, etc.; 
        instead choose to freely give to that person in some way; address their 
        insensitivity for their good). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">You are depressed and resentful 
        because of how much more gifted in a certain area your friend is than 
        you are. As you study 1 Cor. 12, you realize that God has gifted you to 
        play a unique role in his Body (<em>Know</em>). You agree that the difference 
        between you and your friend in gifted areas is part of God's design rather 
        than you getting the short end of the stick (<em>Consider</em>). Now what 
        would it look like to <em>Present</em> ourselves on this identity truth? 
        (thank God for your friend's contribution; compliment, encourage, and 
        promote your friend's accomplishments in that area; thank God for what 
        he has shown that you can do for him, and look for opportunities to serve 
        in that area). </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&quot;Presenting&quot; usually involves 
      both a negative and positive step. </font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is necessary to choose to <em>turn 
        away from</em> immoral habits (Vs 13a: &quot;do not go on presenting yourselves 
        to sin . . . &quot;)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is also necessary to <em>turn 
        to </em>God in ways that expose you to his alternative (Vs 13b: &quot; 
        . . . but present yourselves to God . . . &quot;). Real change involves 
        the willingness to say &quot;No!&quot; (e.g., STAYING OUT OF SEXUALLY 
        TEMPTING SITUATIONS)&#151;but this is ultimately futile unless we also 
        say &quot;Yes!&quot; to the ways that expose us to God's life-changing 
        power. This is the &quot;Resist-Replace&quot; principle. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">EXAMPLES: </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Sensuality: practically avoiding 
          tempting situations (Resist) + developing Christ-centered love relationships 
          (Replace)&#151;see 1 Thess. 4:3-10; 2 Tim. 2:22 </font></p>

          ministry role (Replace)&#151;1 Tim. 6:11</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I'm depressed so I think I'll

      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Again, when helping other Christians 
        grow, our counsel should include helping them see clearly what presenting 
        themselves to God (choosing to act) in this area based on their new identity 
        (see above) would look like.</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The New Testament refers to dozens 
    of aspects of our new identity in Christ. See Dennis McCallum, <i>Walking

    <i>Victory Over The Darkness</i>, pp. 45-47, 57-59&#151;which refers to 68 aspects.

    and the key aspects of this new identity. THIS WILL BE ON THE TEST! </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The point here is that <i>God</i> meets 
    our deepest needs through our <em>New Identity</em> in Christ. To the extent 
    that we are ignorant of and/or don't appropriate this, we will go on suffering 
    as needlessly &quot;needy&quot; people, trying to get other people/things 
    to meet our needs, being disappointed by them when they can't, etc. (E.G. 
    an insecure spouse needs to look to God who has filled that need, not to their 
    spouse's actions for their source of security)</font></p>

    on a more and more consistent basis. Conversely, if 5 years later he has run

    it will be because he did not take these steps . . . </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">When we confront a new sin area for 
    the first time, we often need to go through the &quot;Know, Consider, Present&quot; 
    process in almost a systematic, yet prayerful manner&#151;repeatedly. As God's 
    Spirit changes our character through this process, we will find ourselves 
    going through the same process, but much more quickly with a deeper sense 
    of dependence on God working through us. What once were areas of repetitive 
    failures in our character, are now areas of substantial (though usually not 
    complete) victory. This process of working through deep-seated issues may 
    take years of walking in the Spirit.</font></p>

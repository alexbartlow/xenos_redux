<h3><a NAME="a1"></a>Introduction </h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Review &quot;one another&quot; thesis: Jesus' command (Jn. 13:34,35) is unpacked 
    by the apostles for us. We need to be involved enough with other Christians 
    that we are consistently giving and receiving God's love in these different 
    ways (2 Tim. 4:1,2). </p>
  <p><small>Eph. 4:15 but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all 
    aspects into Him, who is the head, even Christ,</small></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Body-life is largely the outcome of a group of Christians <i>speaking the 
      truth to one another </i>in love (Eph. 4:15). As a group of Christians communicate 
      God's truth to one another with an attitude of genuine love toward one another, 
      this creates a climate conducive to spiritual growth. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><small>1 Thess. 5:14* And we urge you, brethren, admonish the unruly, encourage 
    the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with all men.</small></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Speaking the truth in love involves many things, but its primary components 
      are <i>encouragement</i> and <i>admonition</i>. These two &quot;one another&quot; 
      imperatives are the verbal ones that are mentioned most frequently in the 
      epistles (see 1 Thes. 5:14*). Each recognizes a key need of Christians, 
      and each seeks to meet that need by communicating a key portion of God's 
      truth, as we will see.&nbsp; If we commit ourselves to become adept at these, 
      we will build the foundation of an effective, Spirit-led ministry.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Both encouragement and admonition characterize healthy Christian friendships, 
    marriages, and home groups. </p>

<h3><a NAME="a2"></a>ENCOURAGING ONE ANOTHER </h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><b>Parakaleo</b></i><b> comes from the root <i>kaleo</i> (&quot;to call&quot;) 
    and the preposition <i>para</i> (&quot;around&quot;).</b> Thus, the word means 
    &quot;to call alongside,&quot; or &quot;to call to or for.&quot; It was sometimes 
    used in extra-biblical Greek to describe military situations in which soldiers 
    were strengthened to fight on in battle. </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Like all words, <i>parakaleo</i> has a fairly wide semantic range. In the 
      New Testament, it is translated &quot;appeal,&quot; &quot;exhort,&quot; 
      &quot;console,&quot; &quot;comfort,&quot; &quot;help(er),&quot; &quot;entreat,&quot; 
      &quot;urge.&quot; </p>
    <p><b>Four Types of Encouragement: What does encouragement look like?</b> 
      Encouragement as it is demonstrated in the Bible has at least four faces: 
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><i>Expressing belief in one's position and potential in Christ</i>

          <p>Paul expresses empathy about Thessalonian Christians whose loved 
            ones had died, and then reminds them about the Rapture (1 Thes. 4:14,18). 
            We should express empathy when someone experiences a tragic accident 
            or health problem, but then lovingly remind them of Romans 5:3-5; 
            8:28-39; Heb. 13:5; etc. We should empathize with Christians who are 
            realizing how much more sinful they are than they realized, but then 
            also remind them that this is part of the breaking process (Rom.&nbsp;7; 
            2&nbsp;Cor. 4,12). </p>
          <blockquote>

          <p>When MARATHON RUNNERS hit the &quot;wall,&quot; having loved ones

<h3>How To Become An Effective Encourager </h3>
<ul>
  <li><i>Be willing to receive encouragement.&nbsp; </i></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p> Some of us are too proud to receive, or even to ask for some encouragement 
    from others when we are hurting. But we are members of one another, and since 
    God has decided to give much of his encouragement through other Christians, 
    we need to acknowledge our weaknesses and come forward for help. There is 
    no virtue in slowing bleeding to death spiritually when we could more quickly 
    be restored by receiving some encouragement. (See 1 Thes. 5:14)</p>
 
  <dl> 
    <dt>QUALIFICATION: Those who are quick to demand that others make them feel 
      loved, etc. should not abuse this principle! This is a form of idolatry, 
      because we are demanding that other people make us feel secure, loved, significant, 
      etc. Are you thankful to God when he graciously sends someone to encourage 
      you, or are you angry at people who fail to make you feel better? God may 
      sovereignly withhold human encouragement from us when we have this attitude, 
      so we will learn to depend on him more deeply.</dt>
  </dl>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li> <i>Take creative initiative</i>. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p><small>(Heb. 10:24,25*) and let us consider how to stimulate one another 
    to love and good deeds, 25 not forsaking our own assembling together, as is 
    the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more, as you see 
    the day drawing near.</small></p>
  <p>Those who are effective in encouragement spend time prayerfully reflecting 
    on this issue when they are <i>not</i> with the person. </p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>EDIFICATION GOALS FOR HOME GROUP: This is one of the keys to an edifying 
      atmosphere vs. a funeral home. When a significant number of people have 
      come with this commitment and planning, the meeting is edifying. We shouldn't 
      make the teacher carry the whole weight! To come consistently with this 
      attitude (even when hurting) is one of the key components of an effective 
      Christian worker.&nbsp; Also, this is what keeps the meeting exciting for 
      us, when we come prepared to serve. </p>
    <p>WITH SPOUSE/CLOSE FRIENDS/DISCIPLES: The tendency here is to slack off 
      on encouragement with these people because you think &quot;They already 
      know these things,&quot; etc. But exerting consistent and creative effort 
      in this area is one of the keys to building truly satisfying close relationships!</p>

    <p>This is important so that we can discern what fears the person has and/or 
      what they need to be motivated to do. Also, good listeners find that the 
      other person is usually receptive to what he has to say because he showed 
      him concern and respect by listening. </p>
    <p>Many of us need to consciously practice other-centered listening because 
      we can engage only in superficial talk or serious talk about ourselves. 
      This area teaches us how self-centered we are.&nbsp; If this is our problem, 
      we should practice seeing how long we can go only inquiring about the other 
      person and seeking to understand him/her.&nbsp; Can we delight in getting

  <p>(See chart at beginning of notes) DEFINITION: Moral correction through verbal 
    confrontation which is motivated by love. </p>
  <p>The most common Greek word for admonition, <i>noutheteo</i>, from the noun 
    &quot;mind&quot; (<i>nous</i>) and the verb &quot;put&quot;/&quot;place&quot; 
    (<i>tithemi</i>) means &quot;to place upon the mind.&quot; This word and its 
    Greek synonyms (<i>elegcho</i>; <i>epitimao</i>), are also translated &quot;instruct,&quot; 
    &quot;convict,&quot; &quot;correct,&quot; &quot;reprove,&quot; &quot;warn,&quot; 
    &quot;refute,&quot; &quot;expose,&quot; and &quot;rebuke.&quot; </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>Biblical admonition</i> recognizes that Christians are sinful and liable 
      to self-deception, and seeks to correct them by communicating God's imperatives/commands.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>All Christians should be willing and able to admonish as well as encourage. 
    In Rom. 15:14* notice that Paul is confident that all of the Christians in 
    Rome can admonish one another&#151;not just the leadership. He has never been 
    in Rome to train them, yet he is confident of this! Notice also two qualities 
    that he says enable them to admonish effectively: </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><small>Rom. 15:14* And concerning you, my brethren, I myself also am convinced 
      that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and

    <ul>
      <li><b>&quot;Goodness&quot;</b> - This obviously doesn't mean moral perfection, 
        but rather good will&#151;loving concern for one another's well-being

<h3>Why Admonition Is Unpopular</h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Some formidable forces make it a challenge to build deep convictions about 
    this issue. We should be aware of these forces and know the biblical response&#151;but 
    never use them as an excuse. In a class this size, some of you probably haven't 
    thought your way through some of these . . . </p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <ul>
      <li><i>Cultural Pressure</i>: Despite the fact that these two forms of biblical 
        love balance and temper one another, they are often pitted against one 
        another today. Encouragement is &quot;in&quot; but admonition is &quot;out.&quot; 
        No one likes admonition because of our sin nature, but our culture has 
        particular problems with this. Our culture has largely rejected the legitimacy 
        of moral absolutes and therefore equates moral correction with unloving 
        intolerance. According to today's secular climate, humans are capable 
        of healthy moral self-direction and are rendered dysfunctional by external 
        moral intrusion. Admonition is therefore seen as unnecessary and even 
        harmful. </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Unfortunately, many Christians have assimilated this mentality to a remarkable 
        degree. Encouragement is seen as mandatory to spiritual growth, but admonition 
        is tragically absent from many Christians' view of love. It is not &quot;politically 
        correct&quot; in the current climate for Christians to confront one another 
        about moral issues. Those who admonish other Christians run the risk of 
        being called intrusive at best, and spiritually abusive at worst. Yet 
        the New Testament is clear that, because of human depravity, it is not 
        possible to love one another without admonishing one another. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><i>Past Experience</i>: Some have experienced abusive, excessive or 
          unloving discipline from parents or church leaders. We should understand 
          why people would react against all correction because of this. But this 
          is clearly the BABY-BATHWATER fallacy. In rejecting all correction, 
          we will certainly create a situation just as harmful as the original 
          problem.&nbsp; As mentioned last week, we don't only have problems when 
          we've had abusive authority figures in our past (parents, teachers, 
          etc.) but every bit as damaging are permissive authority figures (parents, 
          teachers, etc.).&nbsp; This is becoming more and more the issue we run 
          into when admonishing in this society. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><i>Temperamental Weakness</i>: Some (PHLEGMATICS &#151; see temperaments 
          in Unit two discussion on Sin Nature) are naturally prone to be diplomatic, 
          compromising peacemakers. Our culture tends to reward this behavior, 
          so it can go virtually unchallenged before you begin to walk with Christ. 
          Your flesh will tend to point out people who are overly confrontative, 
          and tell you that you are more loving than they are. If you don't let 
          God sanctify you in this key area, your relationships will tend to be 
          superficial and your ministry (especially discipleship) will be ineffective. 
          Lean against your ingrained tendency to avoid confrontation: prioritize 
          it, make yourself accountable to others to do it, etc. </p>

    <p>It is very difficult, if not impossible, to mature without receiving admonition! 
      Solomon makes this point over and over to those who want to be wise and 
      spiritually successful. </p>
   
    <p><small>Prov 9:8 - Do not reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you. Reprove a 
      wise man, and he will love you. </small></p>
    <p><small>Prov 10:17 - He is on the path of life who heeds instruction, but 
      he who forsakes reproof goes astray. </small></p>
    <p><small>Prov 12:1 - Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but he who 
      hates reproof is stupid. </small></p>
    <p><small>Prov 13:18 - Poverty and shame will come to him who neglects discipline, 
      but he who regards reproof will be honored. </small></p>
    <p><small>Prov 15:5 - A fool rejects his father's discipline, but he who regards 
      reproof is prudent. </small></p>
    <p><small>Prov 15:32,33 - He who neglects discipline despises himself, but 
      he who listens to reproof acquires understanding. The fear of the LORD is 
      the instruction for wisdom, And before honor comes humility. </small></p>
    <p><small>Prov 17:10 - A rebuke goes deeper into one who has understanding 
      than a hundred blows into a fool. </small></p>
    <p><small>Prov 24:24,25 - He who says to the wicked, &quot;You are righteous,&quot; 
      peoples will curse him, nations will abhor him; But to those who rebuke 
      the wicked will be delight, and a good blessing will come upon them. </small></p>
    <p><small>Prov 27:5,6 - Better is open rebuke than love that is concealed. 
      Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but deceitful are the kisses of an 
      enemy. </small></p>
    <p><small>Prov 29:1 - A man who hardens his neck after much reproof will suddenly 
      be broken beyond remedy. </small></p>
    <p><small>Eccles. 7:5 - It is better to listen to the rebuke of a wise man 
      than for one to listen to the song of fools.</small> </p>
   
    <p><b>How did you treat the last person that reproved you? Do you think they 
      will want to help you again with a reproof?</b></p>
    <p><b>Have you ever thanked someone for admonishing you? </b></p>

<ul>
  <li><i>Be suspicious of fleshly defensiveness on your part.</i></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Nothing could be more common than for us to think &quot;How dare she say 
      this? . . . What about his sins? . . . She didn't say that very sensitively? 
      . . . you don't know all the facts . . . &quot; </p>
    <p>We have to get to the where we can receive and profit from correction that 
      comes to us in imperfect ways through fallen people. If we are only willing 
      to receive correction directly from God (via Word, personal conviction), 
      we will miss out on much sanctification. </p>
    <p>If we have responded with inappropriate defensiveness, we should go back 
      and apologize for this. Otherwise, we are teaching people to leave us alone&#151;and 
      we will pay the price.</p>
    <p>Defensiveness can take the form of self-deprecation. Some of us are visibly 
      crushed by admonition and people sense our despair and become reluctant 
      to correct us. Hebrews 12:5 instructs us not to be &quot;crushed&quot; by 
      God's discipline, but to see it as his loving influence in our life.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><i>Focus on the content of the admonition.</i></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Specifically, you should ask yourself two questions: &quot;Do I recognize 
      this action or attitude in my life?&quot; and &quot;Does the Bible speak 
      of it as wrong?&quot; </p>
   
    <blockquote> 
      <p>If you can answer &quot;yes&quot; to these questions, you should thank 
        the person and prayerfully go to work on this issue. If you are already 
        addressing the issue, let them know. If you haven't been, you might ask 
        them for input on how you can work on this area. The godly Christian knows 
        how to profit from a rebuke even when it is given in the wrong way (2 
        Sam. 16:5-12). </p>
      <p>If your answer is &quot;no,&quot; you will need to respond accordingly. 
        Depending on the spirit with which the person admonished you, you may 
        want to thank him for his concern. But do not admit/apologize just to 
        make peace. It is just as wrong to apologize for an action when you aren't 
        wrong as it is to not apologize when you are wrong (see Paul in 1&nbsp;Cor. 
        4:3-5). If we lie to make peace people learn not to trust us.</p>

  <p><b>Receiving Admonition in our Close Relationships</b></p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>In healthy close Christian relationships, there is <i>mutual</i> freedom 
      and openness in this area. This kind of mutual accountability is to be highly 
      valued. We will not be effective in giving admonition unless you first know 
      how to receive it. Consider the following questions as you review your own 
      Christian friendships: </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ol>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p>1.&nbsp; <i>Do they know they have the &quot;green light&quot; to admonish 
        you?</i> Or have you taught them not to do this by your reactions, or 
        are you so uninvolved that they don't know enough about your life to be 
        able to reprove you? If you are unsure about this, you should consider 
        asking them if they feel this freedom. If they don't, ask them why they 
        don't. </p>
      <p>2.&nbsp; <i>Do they feel the freedom to raise questions about issues 
        that are not black and white?</i> Or do they feel they must have an open 
        and shut case before they can ask you? Much of the &quot;fine-tuning&quot; 
        of our characters comes through other Christians who know us well&#151;our 
        tendencies, weaknesses, etc. EXAMPLE: &quot;Are you just responding to 
        this guy's interest in you&#151;or are you prayerfully deciding what you 
        should do about this relationship?&quot; </p>
      <p>3.&nbsp; <i>Do they feel the freedom to kid you about your weak areas 
        and besetting sins?</i> This is a good sign that Christians are involved 
        deeply in one another's lives and relating to each other under grace. 
        Or do they feel like they have to walk on eggs around you because you 
        are so defensive, thin-skinned, etc.? When Christians silently agree to 
        relate to each other this way, it destroys true fellowship. OLD PROVERB:

        about.&quot;</p>

<h3>Giving Admonition </h3>
<ol>
  <li><i>It requires wisdom and discernment.</i> </li>
</ol>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Because of the complexity of human situations, it is impossible to prescribe 
      a formula for when admonition is appropriate. Before admonishing someone, 
      it is important to <i>prayerfully</i> ask ourselves questions like these: 
    </p>
   
    <ul>
      <li>Are you honestly committed to seeking his/her good (Mt. 18:12-14)?&nbsp; 
        Our heart should &quot;be breaking&quot; over their struggle in the area, 
        knowing they are hurting their walk with God and their relationships.&nbsp; 
        If they have sinned against you, have you honestly forgiven them (Mt. 
        18:21,22), or are you more interested in venting your own anger because 
        you were offended and are going to make them pay? Have you forgiven the 
        other person for the hurt he caused you, or do you want to pay him back? 
        Unless we can answer these questions affirmatively, we cannot trust our 
        judgment about whether and how to admonish. </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote> 
      <dl> 
        <dd>Jesus simply said, &quot;When your brother sins, go and reprove him 
          . . . &quot; (Matthew 18:15) Scripture provides valuable guidance by 
          placing this statement between two parables. In the preceding context, 
          he told the parable of the shepherd who left the ninety-nine sheep to 
          find the one sheep who was lost. In the following context, Jesus told 
          the parable of the steward who was forgiven his debts but refused to 
          forgive his debtor. Evidently, the attitudes of loving concern and forgiveness 
          help us to discern when to admonish and how to admonish effectively.</dd>
      </dl>
    </blockquote>
   
    <ul>
      <li>You may need to consider the following questions.&nbsp; They sometimes 
        apply, sometimes don't; God often uses these considerations to express 
        his wisdom on the issue.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Does the Bible clearly describe this issue as sin? If you're not sure, 
          find out. </p>
       
        <p>Do you know for a fact that the person did what you think, or is it 
          hearsay? If in doubt, start your discussion tentatively, asking questions. 
        </p>
        <p>Do you tend to be overly critical or overly soft in your dealings with 
          others? Wisdom dictates that we should know our own temperamental tendencies 
          and lean against them. If you tend to be overly soft on others because 
          you are fearful of conflict, you may need to check yourself to see whether 
          you are &quot;chickening out&quot; of giving a needed admonition. But 
          if you tend to be overly critical in your dealings with others, you 
          may need to ask yourself why you shouldn't practice forbearance. </p>
        <p>We should be especially careful about judging motives of others when 
          their actions are not clearly wrong (1 Cor. 4:5). Motivation is a moral 
          issue, but we are not equipped to detect wrong motivation as accurately 
          as we can detect wrong behavior. </p>
        <p>Is the person already aware of this issue and working on it? If this 
          is the case, perhaps our best response is usually to show patience and 
          forbearance. </p>
        <p>How serious is the issue? Consider: Is it a pattern or only a one-time 
          occurrence? </p>
        <p>What is his/her role in the church? </p>

      to receive correction from those who have expressed affirmation and belief

      we do (which is the subject of admonition) and who we are. In this environment, 
      admonition is more easily perceived as the loving action that it is. In 
      a healthy family, for example, parents build an encouragement-rich environment 
      which provides a context for their children to benefit most from their parents' 
      admonition. </dd>
    <dd>This principle, however, does not prevent us from admonishing people whom 
      we don't know well and/or haven't been encouraging recently. This

      right to be heard.&quot; <i>Admonition is not a right that we earn; it is 
      grace that we give and a labor of love.</i> We should precede admonition

  <blockquote> 
    <p>Jesus said, &quot;When your brother sins, go and reprove him <i>in private</i>.&quot; 
      (Matthew 18:15) In most cases, admonition should be given in private. Though 
      it may be more convenient or less scary for us to correct someone in the 
      presence of others, it usually not best for the person we are correcting. 
      This is because private admonition makes it easier for the other person 
      to listen to our correction without being defensive. Group or public admonition 
      should be reserved for very serious sins or for when the person has demonstrated 
      an unwillingness to respond to earlier private admonition. 
    <dl> 
      <dd>Likewise, a face-to-face setting is preferable to a phone call or letter 
        AND CERTAINLY NOT E-MAIL. Of course, there are exceptions to this, but 
        this is a general rule of thumb. We may feel more comfortable confronting 
        someone with the protection afforded by a phone or letter, but the goal 
        is to help the other person&#151;not to make it easy for us. Much communication 
        is nonverbal, and only face to face conversation allows full nonverbal 
        communication. There may be issues that should be discussed or clarified 
        on the spot, and this is not possible in a letter. A face-to-face meeting 
        communicates directness and vulnerability on the part of the one who is 
        admonishing. A letter in follow up after a conversation may help people 
        remember issues.</dd>

      resort to our own human cleverness or our charm or the forcefulness of our 
      personalities. Instead, we should rely on the power of God's truth and the 
      convicting work of his Spirit. Remember &quot;the Word of God is living 
      and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing as far as the division 
      between soul and spirit . . . able to judge the thoughts and intentions 
      of the heart.&quot; (Hebrews 4:12) </dd>

  <dl> 
    <dd>In order to give God the opportunity to convict the other person, we should 
      normally urge him to prayerfully reflect on what we have said if he doesn't 
      respond properly to your admonition. Unless the matter is so serious that 
      immediate compliance is necessary (physical violence, for example), it is 
      usually best to respond to his resistance by saying something like, &quot;I'd 
      like you to think and pray about what I've shared with you on this issue. 
      Let's talk more about this in a couple of days.&quot; </dd>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dd>This gives the person some time to calm down, and it affords God some 
      time to penetrate their initial resistance with his conviction. We should 
      pray for this. Of course, it is important to follow up such a suggestion 
      by actually revisiting the issue soon. No doubt this is why Jesus prescribed 
      multiple discussions in Matthew 18:15-17. </dd>

  <li><i>It should be practical and constructive when possible.</i></li>

  <dl> 
    <dd>Galatians 6:2 says we should &quot;restore with gentleness&quot; those 
      who have been caught in any trespass. This verse certainly underscores the 
      importance of having a redemptive attitude toward the people we admonish, 
      but it also urges us to go even farther. Are there practical ways we can 
      help the person overcome this sin? Is there additional help we might be 
      able to give? It is certainly valid to say &quot;God says you should not 
      be having sex with your girlfriend.&quot; But after the person has agreed 
      that this is wrong, it may be more helpful to follow this admonition with 
      a suggestion like &quot;Why don't you and your girlfriend evaluate what 
      situations make it easy for you to fall sexually, and agree together to 
      avoid those situations?&quot; Being constructive may require more mental 
      effort on our part before we admonish someone, but it is part of being a 
      restorative influence. </dd>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dd>QUALIFICATION: There are times when we must address issues without having 
      any constructive practical help to offer. If we have made the effort and 
      come up empty, we often still need to be willing to speak the corrective 
      word. In these situations, it is sufficient to say that we would like to 
      be able to help more, and that we will be praying for God to give the person 
      the insight he may need to overcome this issue. We may also urge him to 
      talk to someone we know who may be able to give him this kind of help. We 
      can direct people toward Home Group leaders and/or Xenos Counselors.</dd>

<blockquote> 
  <p>An excellent summary of a godly approach to admonition can be found in Paul's 
    words to Timothy.</p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><small>2 Tim. 2:24 And the Lord's bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, 
      but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged, 25 with gentleness 
      correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance 
      leading to the knowledge of the truth, 26 and they may come to their senses 
      and escape from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him 
      to do his will.</small><br>

<h3><a NAME="a4"></a>Assessing Relationships &amp; Groups </h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Now that we've studied encouragement and admonition, consider some of your 
    key Christian relationships in light of these two ways of &quot;speaking the 
    truth in love.&quot; Where would they fall in the chart below? What can <i>you</i> 
    do to improve them (<i>not</i>: &quot;What should they do to improve them?&quot;)? 
  </p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><img SRC="../../graphics/speaktruth_chart.gif" WIDTH="461" HEIGHT="305"></p>
    <p>&quot;DISENGAGED&quot; - This is what I call &quot;playing church.&quot; 
      This is the antithesis of Christian Body-life and often characterizes the 
      modern church. Our criticism of the traditional church (RITUAL OF FELLOWSHIP; 
      TURN &amp; GREET; FELLOWSHIP HALL) is about this. People are physically 
      present during meetings, but that's about it. People rarely get together 
      outside of meetings. Or if they do get together, it is usually limited to 
      diffuse settings or superficial and safe conversations. People are courteous, 
      even friendly&#151;but distant. There is an atmosphere of superficiality, 
      sometimes an unspoken conspiracy to not be deeply involved in one another's 
      lives. </p>
    <p>&quot;FINGER-POINTING&quot; - This is what characterized many of our home 
      churches during the early 1980's. People were being admonished too frequently 
      (sometimes for things that should have been tolerated, sometimes for things 
      that weren't even sin). People were being held accountable for things they 
      hadn't agreed to do. This kind of group or relationship is usually goal- 
      and task-oriented, and highly activistic. But because there is little encouragement, 
      a legalistic climate develops. The goals of the group or focus on sin tends 
      to dominate so there is limited time and energy to help people in need. 
      Anger and self-righteousness rather than genuine love become the motivation 
      for admonition. In this climate, it's easy to be afraid to open up about 
      your weaknesses and failures, because you're afraid you will be judged. 
      It's easy to simply perform in the externals to earn approval and acceptance. 
      People burn out, or run away because they can't take the pressure . . . 
    </p>
    <p>&quot;SUPPORT GROUP&quot; - This could also be called the &quot;schmoozing&quot; 
      atmosphere. Our culture, working from a humanistic and deterministic base, 
      approves of encouragement and regards it as essential for our fragile psyches. 
      The theory seems to be &quot;If we just affirm and encourage people, they 
      will naturally grow.&quot; But it hates admonition and regards it as destructive 
      and an unloving violation of personal privacy. Of course, this is inadequate 
      because people are also sinful and prone to self-deception. When we are 
      not being called on to take responsibility to deal with our sins and move 
      forward, our moral problems and low commitment go unaddressed and therefore 
      tend to get worse. The group or relationship takes on a warm, but soft tone. 
      It becomes more resistant to confrontation, challenge, calls to action&#151;seeing 
      them more and more as &quot;unloving,&quot; &quot;intrusive,&quot; &quot;legalistic.&quot; 
      People who see the need for admonition get frustrated because they aren't 
      supported in this difficult work. They may even be viewed as the unloving 
      one, the problem in the group. </p>
    <p>HEALTHY BODY-LIFE - In a home group or relationship which has healthy Body-life, 
      people are communicating both encouragement and admonition in appropriate 
      and timely ways. The leaders have modeled this, and others have begun to 
      imitate them. The atmosphere is warm, but also forward moving. People feel 
      affirmed, but also challenged. The chart is somewhat deceptive here, because 
      in a healthy group encouragement will be more frequent than admonition. 
      This is the ideal toward which we should strive. </p>
  </blockquote>
 
  <p>NOTE:&nbsp; We have a policy in this church that in serious situations you 
    can &quot;go over the head&quot; of your leaders.&nbsp; Every home group has 
    a staff consultant that can be approached for advice if there is not resolution 
    on the home group level.&nbsp; We also have a Grievance Board if needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Memory Verses </h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Rom. 15:14* - All Christians have the responsibility to admonish one another. 
    Goodness (love) and (biblical) knowledge are the two keys to effective admonition. 
  </p>
  <p>1 Thes. 5:14* - All Christians should practice encouragement and admonition 
    as appropriate. </p>
  <p>Heb. 10:24,25* - Effective encouragement requires prayerful forethought. 
    We should come together with other Christians willing and ready to encourage 
    them. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Assignment </h3>
<p>Read Fee &amp; Stewart, <i>How to Read the Bible Book by Book</i>, p. 14-24, 
  267-268. Write a one-page summary of what you read.</p>

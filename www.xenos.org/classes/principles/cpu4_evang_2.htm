        to explain what else Christianity says, including where we disagree with 
        the current postmodern consensus (e.g., absolute truth, one way of salvation, 
        ability to adequately understand the author's intended meaning, etc.).</font></p>

<dir> 
  <ul>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">When talking about spiritual things 
      with people influenced by postmodern thought, you will hear all kinds of 
      things you disagree with (Examples: amorphous spirituality; relativism; 
      positive statements about other religions, etc.). If you feel you must disagree 
      with every false statement, you'll come off as excessively critical and 
      probably not be heard. Instead, prioritize what you'll disagree with (e.g., 
      &quot;All forms of spirituality are equally valid.&quot;) and be prepared

        he exists, but also that he has certain attributes: namely, tremendous

        They know this because of the moral conscience, which he has instilled 
        in each person. These passages make two important points. </font></p>
     
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>First: </strong>The amount 
          of light is considerable. God reveals to the unevangelized that he is 
          powerful, personal (because he is intelligent and righteous). Man's 
          conscience also convicts him that he has violated God's righteous character 
          (Romans&nbsp;2:15). Responding to this light properly would mean humbly 
          coming before God asking for mercy. Thus, though the <b>mean</b><strong>s</strong> 
          of man's forgiveness is not revealed through general revelation, the 
          <b>need</b> for it is revealed. </font></p>
       
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Second:</strong> The 
          point of Paul's argument in Romans&nbsp;1 and 2 is that these people 
          have been given enough light to be justly condemned. But it would seem 
          to follow (because of God's justice) that this would also be enough 
          light to be saved-if people respond to it properly. </font></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
   
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Another biblical fact is relevant 
      to this question. <strong>Old Testament believers were saved by their faith 
      before the Jesus came.</strong> &nbsp; Hebrews&nbsp;11 lists many Old Testament 
      figures who fit this description. Old Testament Jews had access to special 
      revelation, but they had no clear understanding of God's plan of salvation, 
      because the fact that the Messiah must die for our forgiveness was not clearly 
      revealed (Luke&nbsp;24:44-47; 1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:10-12). Furthermore, some 
      of the Old Testament people who were saved (like Melchizedek and Job) had 
      little or no access to the special revelation to Abraham.</font></p>
   
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Another possibility is that God will 
      judge based on his knowledge of how people <b>would have</b> <strong>responded</strong> 
      had they heard the message.</font></p>

  <dir> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Conclusion:</b> If the &quot;person 
      without the Bible&quot; responds properly, (as defined above) to the light 
      God has given him, he would be saved by grace through faith by asking God 
      for mercy. He will be saved only through the death of Christ, because &quot;no 
      man comes to the Father but through Me&quot; (John&nbsp;14:6). In this way, 
      the unevangelized person today is much like the Jew before the time of Christ: 
      he is justified before God by responding in faith to the light, which he 
      has. (For an extensive discussion see Donald Richardson. <em>Eternity in

      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Qualification #1: Does

      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">By no means. Most world religions 
          are animistic, polytheistic, or pantheistic. But Romans&nbsp;1 teaches 
          that <strong>the</strong> <strong>truly open person will recognize that 
          there is one God</strong> who is intelligent and personal, and that 
          worshipping other god(s) is therefore an act of willful rebellion. Again, 
          virtually all world religions teach a &quot;works&quot; approach to 
          the deity&#151;that the acceptance of the deity is attained by human 
          effort through good works and/or ritual observance. But Romans&nbsp;2:14,15

          guilty before God </strong>and therefore have no claim on God's acceptance 
          based on their own effort (works or ritual). Therefore, those who respond 
          to God's general revelation by casting themselves on his mercy will 
          be at odds with crucial elements in their native religious setting. 
          Missionaries have reported many such people who responded quickly to 
          their message of the one true God and his way of salvation.</font></p>

            disciples of all nations&quot;</strong> (Matthew&nbsp;28:19) <strong>pointless</strong>. 
            The answer is &quot;yes&quot; because there is evidently a general 
            correspondence between the amount of light given and the number of 
            people who repent and are saved. </font></li>

            Capernaum, Chorazin and Bethsaida had received. </font></li>

            judging by the paganism which pervaded Africa in the mid 1800's. It 
            is no coincidence that today, after 150 years of missionary activity, 
            almost 50% of Black Africans are evangelical Christians. Therefore, 
            <strong>the number of people who get saved through general revelation

        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Most Americans believe 
          that if there is a hell, only really bad people will go there.</strong> 
          But there is a fatal flaw in this belief. How bad is bad enough? If 
          Mother Theresa is good enough to go to heaven, and if Stalin is bad 
          enough to go to hell, should we draw the line exactly halfway between 
          them? What if you were one sin on Stalin's side of that line (that bad 
          thought you had about your mother when you were ten years old)? Is this 
          fair? No matter where you draw the line in this scenario, you always 
          have the same dilemma. The Bible rejects this answer for one simple 
          reason: it draws the line at God's moral perfection (Jas.&nbsp;2:10; 
          Matt.&nbsp;5:48; Rom. 11:32 </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">For 
          God has shut up all in disobedience that He might show mercy to all</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">.). 
          It makes perfect sense, and God is certainly within his rights to draw 
          it here. However, it is really bad news because it means <b>all</b> 
          of us&#151;Stalin, Mother Theresa, you, me&#151;are under God's judgment. 
          But the good news is that God has offered to take the rap for <b>all</b> 
          of us. He says he has come in the Person of Jesus to bear God's judgment 
          for us on the cross (2&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;5:21). Now the way is open for 
          <b>all</b> of us to escape God's judgment&#151;if we put our trust in 
          his payment. That's news you won't find anywhere but in Christianity.

  <blockquote> 
    <ol>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Discuss evangelism regularly.</strong> 
        Matt 24:34b- &quot;For the mouth speaks out of that which fills the heart.&quot;&nbsp; 
        If this is important to you, you will talk about it.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Celebrate conversions.</strong> 
        People learn what is important (in part) by what we get excited about. 
        We want them to know that we share the joy of the angels when one sinner 
        repents. We want them to share our awe at the power of the gospel to penetrate 
        all barriers.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Praise evangelistic efforts. 
        </strong>We transmit values (in part) by whom we admire. Sharing our faith 
        is emotionally and spiritually difficult, especially when people don't 
        respond. People easily get discouraged, and they need to hear us express 
        God's heart&#151;that he is delighted at their love for the lost and their 
        willingness to step out in faith to share their faith. <br>
        Consider Bill Bright's adage in &quot;Witnessing Without Fear&quot;: &quot;Success 
        in evangelism is sharing your faith in the power of the Holy Spirit, leaving 
        the results to God. Failure in evangelism is failure to witness.&quot;</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Pray for the lost corporately.</strong> 
        In our home group's weekly prayer, we make sure that we pray by name for 
        the people we're reaching out to. And we weave this theme through our 
        entire prayer time so that younger Christians learn that reaching others 
        is ultimately why we're here.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Share what you've learned 
        about evangelism.</strong> &nbsp; Christians will be more equipped and 
        motivated to evangelize if you do this periodically. .</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Model outreach. </strong>Reach 
        out to your neighbors, get to know your kids' friends and their parents, 
        witness to the non-Christians other church members are bringing around, 
        etc.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Maintain evangelism as 
        an important &quot;family value.&quot;</strong> Our children will learn 
        to value what we value. &nbsp; If we regularly discuss our burden for 
        the lost, they will &quot;catch it.&quot; &nbsp; If on the other hand 
        we prioritize other values they will catch those instead. &nbsp; If we 
        want our kids to be godly, we can't just protect them from the dangers 
        of culture&#151;but we must teach them how to live victoriously in the 
        spiritual battle. &nbsp; If we have not modeled a love for lost people 
        and an excitement about outreach, we have failed to protect them from 
        the greatest danger of all&#151;narcissism!</font></li>

<h4>Introduction </h4>
<font size="4">
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="4"><font size="3">As Christians, we will regularly confront difficult 
    decisions. They are difficult because their relationship to God's moral will 
    is not obvious. Some of these decisions will have a major impact in our lives 
    making them even more important.</font></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">E.G. -- although it is within his moral framework to marry 
      a Christian, he doesn't specify which one. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">E.G. -- he does say we must work in order to provide for 
      our household and share in his work -- he doesn't tell us which job to take. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">E.G. -- &quot;Should I go back to school or not?&quot; &quot;Should 
      I buy a new or used car?&quot; &quot;What kind of house should I live in 
      -- where?&quot; are examples where we don't find direct guidance. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="4"><font size="3">Yet, does that mean that God doesn't guide 
    us in these areas? That he has no opinion on the matter? That the decisions 
    we make don't matter? That they can't impact our walk with him in any way? 
    </font></font></p>
</blockquote>
</font> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="4"><font size="3">Tonight we'll be talking about guidelines to 
    help us make these types of difficult decisions.</font></font></p>
  <p><font size="3">Examples of different ways God led people (Gideon, the prophets, 
    direct vision of Cornelius, Ethiopian eunuch).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
<p> 
<p><font size="4">Two Personal Questions:</font> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="3">Are you teachable/leadable?&nbsp; Will you follow God's will 
    once you know it? </font></p>
  <p><font size="3">Do you believe that God desires to lead you?&nbsp; God will 
    lead if you will follow.&nbsp; See John 10 and Psalm 23 and their depiction
    of God as a shepherd offering guidance to the sheep. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="a1">Three Foundational Considerations</a></h3>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p><font size="3">God's personal will has 2 dimensions:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li> 
        <p><font size="3">Moral/ Sanctification (<b>Rom. 12:2*</b>; 8:29; 1 Thess. 
          4:3) </font> </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font size="4"><font size="2"><b><font size="3">(Rom. 12:2*)</font></b><font size="3"> 
            And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing 
            of your mind, that you may prove what the will of God is, that which 
            is good and acceptable and perfect.</font></font></font> </p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font size="4"><font size="3">God's desire for each of us is our
                  sanctification. He recognizes that each of us is unique and
                  His
              plan for change will vary individually, but he clearly desires
              to see us progress spiritually. </font></font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font size="2"><b><font size="3">(Eph. 2:10)</font></b><font size="3"> 
            For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, 
            which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them. </font></font> 
          </p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font size="2"><font size="3">It's our new identity in Christ that 
              gives us the basis for following his will.</font></font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font size="2"><b><font size="3">(Rom. 8:29)</font></b><font size="3"> 
            For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the 
            image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren;</font></font></p>
          <p><font size="3"><b>(1 Thess. 4:3) </b>For this is the will of God, 
            your sanctification; that is, that you abstain from sexual immorality;</font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p><font size="3">Ministry Purpose (Col. 1:9,10; Rom. 12:2a,3-8) </font></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <ol>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="3"><b>(Rom. 12:2a,3-8)</b> And do not be conformed to this 
        world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove 
        what the will of God is . . . (3) For through the grace given to me I 
        say to every man among you not to think more highly of himself than he 
        ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as God has 
        allotted to each a measure of faith. (4) For just as we have many members

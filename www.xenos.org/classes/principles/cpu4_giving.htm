<p>Introduction </p>
</b></font>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we want to avoid becoming enmeshed in materialism, we not only need to cultivate a
  lifestyle of spiritual growth and ministry; we also need to cultivate a godly manner of
  dealing with our money and material possessions. The Bible describes this as a habit of
  consistent, sacrificial financial giving to God's work. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>HERBERT KANE: &quot;The last part of the person to convert is the wallet.&quot; How
  true we've seen this to be! Therefore, we need to form deep biblical convictions about
  this area as soon as possible in our Christian lives. </p>
  <p>Remember the connection between our perspective on material things and spiritual 
    things.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><small>Matt. 6:21 &quot;...for where your treasure is, there will your 
      heart be also.&quot;</small></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main text for tonight's study is 2 Corinthians 8 and 9. The historical setting had
  Paul taking up a collection for the Jerusalem church (1 Cor. 16:1-3). It was most likely
  for famine relief. </p>
</blockquote>

  <blockquote>

    <p><b><font size="3">(1 Cor. 16:1-3)</font></b><font size="3"> Now concerning 
      the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so 
      do you also. {2} On the first day of every week let each one of you put 
      aside and save, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come. 
      {3} And when I arrive, whomever you may approve, I shall send them with 
      letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Corinthians had evidently pledged a certain

      to begin a year ago not only to do this, but also to desire to do it.</font></p>

    symptom of the carnality that had plagued the Corinthian church. </p>

<p>1. <a NAME="a1">Giving is motivated by grace ( 2Cor. 8:1-4,9; 9:15)</a> </p>
</font></b>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><strong><font size="3">(2 Cor. 8:1-4)</font></strong><font size="3"> 
    Now, brethren, we wish to make known to you the grace of God which has been 
    given in the churches of Macedonia, {2} that in a great ordeal of affliction 
    their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of 
    their liberality. {3} For I testify that according to their ability, and beyond 
    their ability they gave of their own accord, {4} begging us with much entreaty 
    for the favor of participation in the support of the saints, {9}For you know 
    the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your 
    sake He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich.</font></font></p>

    be to God for <strong>His</strong> [emphasis ours] indescribable gift!</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Paul holds up the Macedonian Christians as an example.
  They viewed giving as a <i>privilege</i> which they begged to have even in the midst of
  great persecution and <i>poverty</i>--because their motivation was &quot;the grace of
  God.&quot; Why does grace motivate giving? </font></p>
</blockquote>

<dir>
  <dir> 
    <p>They were so thankful for Christ's sacrifice for them (8:9), and so vitally 
      aware of what they had received in Christ (forgiveness, eternal life, growth, 
      new family, etc.) that they were motivated out of gratitude to give as much 
      as they could (e.g. Scrooge - someone who eventually saw what he could be 
      rescued from and responded with generosity; Lk.&nbsp;7:47). This is the 
      foundational motivation for <i>all </i>forms of Christian giving (e.g. O.T. 
      Thank-Offering &gt;&gt; Rom. 12:1 &gt;&gt; Phil.&nbsp;4:18). This is probably 
      why Paul &quot;bookends&quot; the imperitives of the section from 2 Cor. 
      8:1 through 9:15 with grace. </p>

  <blockquote> <font SIZE="2">
    <p><font size="3"><b>(Rom. 12:1)</b> I urge you therefore, brethren, by the 
      mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable

    This motive is characteristic of other religions. They usually make giving one of the good
    works by which we earn God's acceptance (ISLAM: alms as one of 5 PILLARS; CATHOLIC

      <p><font size="3">Medieval people had a very real dread of the period of 
        punishment they faced in purgatory... The church taught that before they 
        reached heaven they had to be cleansed of every sin committed in mortal 
        life and they feared purgatory's pains. Indulgences were a way of shortening 
        the punishment in purgatory.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">Luther and others charged that indulgences turned men 
        away from God's forgiveness.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Because our financial situations vary widely
  according to many factors (earning power, family size, previous money management, etc.),
  it is <b>impossible</b> and <b>unscriptural</b> to set a monetary standard for what

  says it is our <b>readiness</b> to give, not the amount we give, that God prizes. It is
  our <b>willingness to sacrifice</b> for him that pleases God more than the actual amount.
  This is what Ron Blue calls the &quot;could give&quot; level. This is why Paul holds up

      involved, the love that accompanies it, and the amount that is left. The 
      supreme value of the widow's gift lay in the fact that she `out of her poverty, 
      put in all she owned, all she had to live on' - while the others gave `out 
      of their surplus' (Mk.&nbsp;12:44). Here is a searching test of our giving,

  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This principle has been so abused by 
    &quot;Health and Wealth&quot; preachers that many Christians have &quot;thrown

    as an incentive to give in order to get rich, thus violating 1&nbsp;Tim. 6:5-10. 
    But Paul undeniably teaches in this passage that godly financial giving <i>does</i> 
    result in blessing to the giver, and the more bountifully we sow, the more 
    bountifully we will reap. He clearly holds this out as an incentive to give.

        Phil.&nbsp;4:18,19). Of course, this may not mean staggering wealth. Neither 
        are we to hoard this, but rather continue to be a &quot;conduit&quot; 
        to bless others. Vs 8 and 11a seem to broaden this promise out to include

  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong><font size="3">Pledge and FST</font></strong><font size="3"><br>
      We are in a big church. Employees, many at a big paycut, leave their jobs, 
      come work at Xenos and this is how they support their families.<br>
      e.g. In this old days we had a paid staff of two and could fly by the seat 
      of our pants</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Big needs require financial preparation. Church leaders 
      need to plan financially, which requires an estimate of a yearly giving 
      budget. So we use a pledge program. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The pledge program facilitates this: signed commitment, 
      reminder, accountability. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">FST: FST is a group of consistent givers in our church. 
      Joining is voluntary. You have to give 5% or more of your income. (5% is 
      low and it frees people up to give to missionaries and other causes outside 
      of Xenos) FST members attend a yearly retreat in December to set the budget 
      priorities for the church.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">This is very unusual, but we feel people committed to supporting 
      this ministry should have a say in how the money is spent. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Div coordinators prioritize their needs in modules. People 
      vote on their proposals. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">FST has a lot to say about which new ministry ideas will 
      be pursued and it giving them a sense of ownership.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">I heartily recommend you get on the FST and check out one 
      of these retreats.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>&quot;Salvation&quot; means 
    rescue or deliverance. </strong>The gospel is that through Christ, God freely 
    delivers us from sin. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Read Phil. 1:6*. For I am confident 
    of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until 
    the day of Christ Jesus.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This passage implies that salvation 
    is given to us in three distinct stages: &quot;he who began a good work . 
    . . will continue to perfect it . . . until the day of Christ Jesus.&quot; 
    The three biblical terms that are most often used to describe these three 
    stages are <i>justification</i>, <i>sanctification</i>, and <i>glorification</i>. 
    Consider the following distinctions between these stages:</font></p>

    uses this term, sanctification, to refer to what we here call &quot;justification&quot;

<ul>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>In a very real sense, this 
    is the most relevant issue for us.</strong> Justification is a done deal, 
    and glorification is assured. Sanctification, however, is an ongoing process&#151;it 
    is &quot;where we are at&quot; as Christians. Many Christians view their conversion 
    as the &quot;end all&quot; to their Christian lives. They can relate how they 
    came to Christ, but not what has happened since then.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>It is a very complicated subject 
    because there are many different views of/approaches to sanctification.</strong> 
    Christians differ in their perspectives on things like: our part/God's part; 
    role of the Law/Holy Spirit; spiritual experience; means of growth. You <i>have 
    </i>a perspective on these issues whether you realize it or not, and this 
    perspective will dramatically affect the whole tone of your Christian life 
    and the life of the church. Since this is the case, we should consciously 
    examine the biblical material on this subject and choose a biblically consistent 
    approach. That's what we want to do this quarter. </font></li>

    subject to confusion and often lose their way. Once we become Christians Satan 
    knows that he has lost the first battle and then attacks the Christian's quest 
    for growth by confusing them. As a result, we often see aberrant spiritual 
    practices which hurt Christ's witness in the world.</font></li>

      I mean&#151;one who is always reading, always exploring questions of truth, 
      poking half the time into esoteric aspects of typology, unfulfilled prophecy, 
      the millennium, the symbolic chapters of Revelation, and the problems of 
      Bible harmony. He or she is not much concerned about experience, not very 
      active in obedience and service of others, and not distinguished for a radically 
      changed life. But the head is always busy with theological questions, and 
      is full to overflowing with doctrine. In an anti-intellectual age like ours, 
      such love of truth, and such devotion to the task of determining it, are 
      rare and precious; and as we saw earlier, interest in the truth about God 
      is natural to all the born-again. But is that interest, in and of itself, 
      a token of good spiritual health?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;No, it is not!&quot;

  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">2 Peter 1:<small>3 seeing that 
    His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, 
    through the true knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence. 
    4 For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, 
    in order that by them you might become partakers of the divine nature, having 
    escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust. 5 Now for this very reason 
    also, applying all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence, and in 
    your moral excellence, knowledge; 6 and in your knowledge, self-control, and 
    in your self-control, perseverance, and in your perseverance, godliness; 7 
    and in your godliness, brotherly kindness, and in your brotherly kindness, 
    love. 8 For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they render you 
    neither useless nor unfruitful in the true knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
    9 For he who lacks these qualities is blind or shortsighted, having forgotten 
    his purification from his former sins. 10 Therefore, brethren, be all the 
    more diligent to make certain about His calling and choosing you; for as long 
    as you practice these things, you will never stumble; 11 for in this way the 
    entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will 
    be abundantly supplied to you.</small></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">vv. 3,4:&nbsp; God supplies the 
    resources we need to progress toward maturity (Phil. 1:6*).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">vv. 5-7:&nbsp; Can you find the 
    3 aspects of spiritual maturity?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">vv. 8-11:&nbsp; What tremendous 
    benefits! Useful and fruitful in God's service; guaranteed to not live a wasted 
    or shattered life; and a rich welcome and reward at the BEMA.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">As you have listened to God's description 
    of spiritual maturity, he has undoubtedly shone his light on some areas in 
    which he wants to develop in you. What is your response going to be? Some 
    of you will feel guilty, others will feel impotent to change, others will 
    be gung-ho. (NOTE TO INSTRUCTOR: You may take time hear to explain the difference 
    between conviction and accusation... more on this in unit 4.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Don't rationalize your weaknesses, 
    or judge those who are imbalanced in ways different from you. The purpose 
    of these next two units is to teach you how to cooperate with God in these 
    areas so that you grow into the kind of balanced and mature Christian workers 
    he desires you to be. Ask God to grow you into full-orbed maturity, and trust 
    that he will reveal both areas of imbalance/deficiency and opportunities to 
    grow in those areas. (NOTE TO INSTRUCTOR: Remind students of attack because 
    they are taking this class. Persevere!</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">See, for example, John's emphasis in 
  1 John on doctrinal fidelity (2:24; 4:1-3;14,15), moral obedience (1:5-2:6) 
  and loving others (2:7-11; 4:7-21). John purposefully defines spirituality in 
  these terms in order to combat a Gnostic emphasis on subjective experience. 
  Paul's letters to Timothy and Titus likewise urge them to emphasize doctrinal 
  understanding (1 Tim. 1:3,4; 3:2,9; 4:6,13,15; 6:3,20; 2 Tim. 1:13,14; 2:8,15,24; 
  3:14-4:4; Titus 1:9,13,14; 2:1,2,7), moral character (1 Tim. 2:2; 3:2-12; 4:12; 
  6:11; 2 Tim. 2:3-6,19-22; 3:16; Titus 1:6-8; 2:2-10; 3:1,2), and love manifested 
  practically through good deeds (1 Tim. 1:5; 2:10,15; 3:4,12; 4:12; 5:10; 6:11,18; 
  2 Tim. 1:7; 2:22,24,25; 3:10; Titus 2:2,4,14; 3:8,14). Jesus' primary concerns 
  for the seven churches in Rev. 2,3 reveals the same three foci: pure doctrine 
  (2:2,6,13-15,20,24; 3:8), moral purity (2:14,20-22), and love (2:4,5,19). The 
  references to these three emphases from the other epistles are too numerous 
  to mention. </font></p>

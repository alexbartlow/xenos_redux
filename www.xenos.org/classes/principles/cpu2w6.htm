<h3><strong><font face="Arial" size="3">Introduction: Review Keys To Growth</font></strong></h3>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Remember:</strong> The goal 
    of spiritual growth is not only formation of Christ-like character and thinking, 
    but ultimately influencing others for Christ (GREAT COMMISSION). Suffering 
    prepares us for bearing fruit.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">One key way by which we grow is to 
    build up the inner man (we wiill explain in context of Walking by the Spirit 
    in <a href="cpu2w8.htm">Week #8</a>). As we take the initiative to do this, 
    we are able to affect others spiritually.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">But there is still the problem of the 
    &quot;outer man&quot; (2 Cor. 4:7-16)--the flesh, or sin-nature. Building 
    up the &quot;inner man&quot; doesn't really affect it. For this problem, God 
    has another outward process by which our outer man is broken down so that 
    the life of Christ can be released.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This is the primary role of suffering 
    in the Christian life (2 Cor 1:8,9), and we will not get beyond a primitive 
    level of spiritual maturity unless we learn this truth and respond properly. 
    Christians who don't understand and respond to suffering in a Biblical fashion 
    often &quot;bail out!&quot; </font></p>
  <blockquote> <font size="2"> 
    <p><b>(2 Cor. 4:7-12)</b> But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show 
      that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us. (8) We are hard 
      pressed. . .perplexed. . . persecuted. . . struck down (10) We always carry 
      around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also 
      be revealed in our body. . . (12) So then, death is at work in us, but life 
      is at work in you.</p>
    <p><b>(Luke 9:23)</b> And He was saying to them all, &quot;If anyone wishes 
      to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and 
      follow Me. For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it, but whoever 
      loses his life for My sake, he is the one who will save it.&quot;</p>
    </font> </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Note: This is a &quot;daily&quot; 
        process which leads to increased spiritual life. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <font size="2">
    <p><b>(Phil. 3:10,11)</b> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that I may know Him, and the 
      power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed 
      to His death; in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.</p>
    </font> </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Note: The &quot;and&quot; after 
        the phrase, &quot;&#133;that I may know Him&#133;&quot; probably means 
        &quot;that is&quot; and serves the purpose of a colon. In other words, 
        Paul is telling us that knowing Christ involves an ongoing process of 
        suffering (&quot;<i>being conformed</i> to his death&quot;) by which the 
        resurrection power of God is unleashed and we come to know Christ better. 
        </font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> <font size="2"> </font> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><strong>(Rom. 8:35,36)</strong>&nbsp; 
      Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, 
      or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Just as it 
      is written, &quot;For thy sake we are being put to death all day long; we 
      were considered as sheep to be slaughtered.&quot; But in all these things 
      we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Note: Again, Paul speaks of a continued 
        process of suffering (&quot;all day long&quot;) which somehow releases 
        the power of God to be victorious in the midst of our sufferings. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><strong>(Watchman Nee)</strong> &quot;What 
      God is now doing is the pruning work of the vinedresser. In our souls there 
      is an uncontrolled development, an untimely growth, that has to be checked 
      and dealt with. God must cut that off. So now there are two things before 
      us to which our eyes must be opened. On the one hand God is seeking to bring 
      us to the place where we live by the life of his Son (&quot;abide in me&quot;). 
      On the other hand he is doing a direct work in our hearts to undo that other 
      natural resource (our sin-nature). Every day we are learning two lessons: 
      a rising up of the life of this One, and a checking and a handing over to 
      death of the other (sinful nature). These two processes go on all the time, 
      for God is seeking the fully developed life of his Son among us . . . What 
      does this mean? It simply means that I will not take any action without 
      relying on God. I will find no sufficiency in myself. I will not take any 
      step just because I have the power to do so. Even though I have that inherited 
      power within me, I will not go ahead solely upon it as (a) basis; I will 
      put no reliance on myself.&quot; (Watchman Nee, <i>The Normal Christian 
      Life </i>[Fort Washington, Penn.: Christian Literature Crusade, 1961], pp. 
      157,158) </font></p>

      say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains 
      by itself alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. (25) &quot;He who 
      loves his life loses it; and he who hates his life in this world shall keep 
      it to life eternal. 26 &quot;If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and 
      where I am, there shall My servant also be; if anyone serves Me, the Father

    a big problem for Christianity--either God is powerful enough to stop suffering 
    but isn't loving, or he wants to stop suffering but lacks the power to do 
    so. Actually, the Bible presents us with a comprehensive (although not exhaustive) 
    explanation. </font></p>

      make something of us which we have not attained yet, and is dealing with 
      us accordingly. Perhaps He means to strengthen us in patience, good humor, 
      compassion, humility, or meekness, by giving us some extra practice in exercising 
      these graces under specially difficult conditions. Perhaps He has new lessons 
      in self-denial and self-distrust to teach us. Perhaps He wishes to break 
      us of complacency, or unreality, or undetected forms of pride and conceit. 
      Perhaps His purpose is to draw us closer to Himself in conscious communion 
      with Him; for it is often the case.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.that fellowship with (God)

      Christ within the believing life advanced? Every circumstance of our lives 
      has been planned with this end in view. Our heredity and environment, our 
      temperament, and all the frustrations and disappointments of life are not 
      the result of blind chance&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;As we subject ourselves 
      to the Word of God, the lordship of Christ, and the leading of the Spirit, 
      the circumstances will combine to wean us from the old life of self-pleasing 
      and to conform us to the image of Christ. Our Father loves us so well that 
      He places us in positions of great difficulty and perplexity, withdraws 
      some cherished object of love, places us to live and work with or among 
      uncongenial people--all in order that we may despair of ourselves and learn 
      to draw more on the resources which are for us in Christ. The process of 
      Christ being formed in us usually progresses more rapidly in times of adversity 
      than in prosperity. When all runs smoothly, we tend to forget our dependence 
      on God, but in times of trouble we turn to Him and appropriate His grace 
      and help. Some of the greatest saints have been those who have been tested 
      most severely. Rightly received, the disciplines of life serve to reproduce

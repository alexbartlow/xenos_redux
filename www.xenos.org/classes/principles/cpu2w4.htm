<h3><b><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</font></b></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">God's will for our lives is fruitfulness 
    (John 15:16)&#151;to become ever more effective in impacting <i>others</i> 
    with the life, love and truth of Christ (God's will is <i>not</i> just my 
    own healing, happiness, etc.). But growing Christians soon discover there 
    is a barrier preventing us from fruitful service and sabotaging our efforts.</font></p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(Watchman Nee)</b> &nbsp; 
      &quot;Anyone who serves God will discover sooner or later that the great 
      hindrance to his work is not others but himself . . . &quot;<a href="#Footnote1B">Footnote1B</a></font></p>
   
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(Watchman Nee) </b>&quot;If 
      you have a very clumsy servant and he just sits still and does nothing, 
      then his clumsiness does not appear. If he does nothing all day he will 
      be of little use to you, it is true, but at least he will do no damage that 
      way. But if you say to him: &quot;Now come along, don't idle away your time: 
      get up and do something,&quot; then immediately the trouble begins. He knocks 
      the chair over as he gets up, stumbles over a footstool a few paces further 
      on, then smashes some precious dish as soon as he handles it. If you make 
      no demands upon him his clumsiness is never noticed, but as soon as you 
      ask him to do anything his awkwardness is apparent at once. The demands 
      were all right, but the man was all wrong. He was as clumsy a man when he 
      was sitting still as when he was working, but it was your demands that made 
      manifest the clumsiness which, whether he was active or inactive, all the 
      time were in his make-up.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">We are all sinners by nature. If 
      God asks nothing of us, all seems to go well, but as soon as he demands 
      something of us, the occasion is provided for a grand display of our sinfulness. 
      The Law makes our weakness manifest. While you let me sit still I appear 
      to be all right, but when you ask me to do anything I am sure to spoil it, 
      and if you trust me with a second thing I will as surely spoil that also. 
      When a holy law is applied to a sinful, man, then it is that his sinfulness 
      comes out in full display. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">God knows who I am: he knows that 
      from head to foot I am full of sin; he knows that I am weakness incarnate; 
      that I can do nothing. The trouble is that I do not know it [last week's 
      topic: <a href="cpu2w3.htm">our new identity</a>]. I admit that all men 
      are sinners, and that therefore I am a sinner; but I imagine that I am not 
      such a hopeless sinner as some. God must bring us all to the place where 
      we see that we are utterly weak and helpless. While we say so, we do not 
      wholly believe it, and God has to do something to convince us of the fact.&quot;<a href="#Footnote2B">Footnote2B</a></font></p>
  </ul>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Therefore, if we want to be deeply 
      fruitful, we're going to need to develop an appreciation for just how deeply 
      sinful we really are. This can be a very sobering week of study. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Tonight's goals:</font></p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">To gain an in-depth biblical understanding 
      of fallen human nature.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">To become more aware of how your 
      own sin-nature operates.</font></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The biblical view of sin includes attitudes, motives, and subtle behavioral 
    habits as well as isolated acts of disobedience.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">See Mark 7:21-23; Gal. 5:19-21; Eph. 
      4:26-5:4; Col. 3:5. Note how Jesus and Paul mix the internal attitudes in 
      with the external actions. The emphasis is on the internal change. </font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="2">(Mark.&nbsp;7:21,22) For from within, out of the heart 
        of men, proceed the evil thoughts, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries, 
        (22) deeds of coveting and wickedness, as well as deceit, sensuality, 
        envy, slander, pride and foolishness. </font><small>23 &quot;All these 
        evil things proceed from within and defile the man.&quot;</small></p>

        people trying to do the right thing, but missing the mark occasionally 
        . . . Many Christians also are inclined to think that sin is a rare exception 
        in their lives. They define it as occasional acts of willful disobedience 
        to known laws of God, such as the Ten Commandments. In this definition, 
        sin is reduced to conscious rebellious actions&#151;major transgression 
        with serious consequences . . . it is obvious that this view screens out 
        most of the serious sin in our lives. In concentrating on actions, we 
        uncover only the tip of the iceberg. Overlooked are our sinful attitudes, 
        the continuing resistance to God's will which give rise to actions. Biblical 
        definitions of sin give much more prominence to attitudes or continuous

        among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the LORD

        he touched my mouth and said, &quot;See, this has touched your lips; your

      In some areas, we are simply not as strong as someone more temperamentally 
      suited (e.g., the melancholic will never be as effusive as the sanguine; 
      the phlegmatic will never be as visionary as the choleric, etc.). Nevertheless 
      we can make substantial progress in areas of temperamental weakness. We 
      should not condemn ourselves in the non-strengths, but accept and embrace 
      God-given diversity in one another&#151;much like spiritual gifts. Don't 
      envy other's temperamental strengths.</font><br>

    </li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Besetting sins often run along temperamental 
      lines: specific areas of vulnerability to sin/ deeply ingrained sin habits. 
      Since we are totally depraved, our temperaments have been corrupted by the 
      fall therefore we find that many of our besetting sins run along temperamental 
      lines: e.g., the <i>melancholic's critical spirit</i>; the choleric's aversion 
      to apologize; the <i>phlegmatic's laziness</i>; the sanguine's lack of self-discipline.

      </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Don't use temperaments to rationalize 
      your sin (ROM 6:6 says otherwise). &quot;That's just the way I am! That's 
      just my personality.&quot; Our tendency is to rationalize these besetting 
      sins as amoral, like our temperamental non-strengths (qualities that people 
      with other temperaments have that I lack).</font> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> 
      However, when we hold them up to the light (God's love that we are called 
      to express), we see plenty of need for God's sanctifying grace. These are 
      the areas, as they come under God's discipline and grace, that revolutionize

    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Marriage, roommates (promote ministry 
      houses for singles), people we serve with&#151;relationships bring our sinful 
      nature to the surface (remember &quot;clumsy servant&quot;)!! Deep and consistent 
      involvement in the Body of Christ allows us to develop close relationships.&nbsp; 
      If we stay aloof from relationships and hold people at arms length, we will 
      never get a good look at how sinful we are, and sadly, never a clear look 
      at God's grace, the very thing we claim we want most.</font></p>
   
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Key Principle: </font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The great temptation, of course, 
        is to focus on how others fail to love us properly. God's way, however, 
        is to have us look primarily at the &quot;log in our own eye&quot; (Matt. 
        7:3-5). If we do this, we will continue to grow regardless of how people 
        treat us, and we will eventually have much better relationships! </font></p>
     
      <blockquote> <font size="2"> 
        <p>(Matthew 7:3-5) And why do you look at the speck that is in your brother's 
          eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? (4) Or how can 
          you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' and 
          behold, the log is in your own eye? (5) You hypocrite, first take the 
          log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck 
          out of your brother's eye.</p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">When it comes to relationships,

        through as all too often they make the mistake of focusing on finding 
        the right person instead.</font></p>
     
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Once we adopt this focus, we will 
        begin to see certain areas of our sinful nature. Let's consider a few

    that also provides an excellent (though often very convicting) grid through 
    which God reveals aspects of our sin nature that He'd like to sanctify&#151;the 
    world system.&nbsp; The world, or <em>kosmos</em> (the Greek term), has a 
    semantic range but in this context the definition most used is the system 
    of values and priorities which is controlled by Satan and used to seduce people 
    from ever coming to a relationship with Christ or Christians from investing 
    heavily into Christian work to be used by God.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The world's values are opposed to 
      God's and will often entice our sin nature into pursuing goals which are 
      contrary to God's.&nbsp; We gravitate towards some of these values more 
      than others. If we look honestly at the three areas of the world's values 
      that John speaks to (materialism, hedonism, egotism&#151;1 Jn. 2:15,16), 
      often we will experience God convicting us that we are not committed to 
      his values.&nbsp; For a more thorough treatment of this subject, see our 
      notes from unit four: <a href="cpu4_satan_2.htm"> Satanology: Covert Tactics

      permanently horrified, perception of one's natural and (it seems) unalterable 
      corruption. The true Christian's nostril is to be continually attentive 
      to the inner cesspool.&nbsp; </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Another 
      author, quoted in Haller's <i>Rise of Puritanism, </i>says that when he 
      looked into his heart, it was &quot;as if I had in the heat of summer looked 
      down into the Filth of a Dungeon, where I discerned Millions of crawling 
      living things in the midst of that Sink and liquid Corruption.'&nbsp; (C. 
      S. Lewis)&nbsp; I won't listen to those who describe that vision as merely 
      pathological. I have seen the 'slimy things that crawled with legs' in my 
      own dungeon. I thought the glimpse taught me sense. But Whyte seems to think 
      it should not be a glimpse but a daily, lifelong scrutiny. Can he be right? 
      It sounds so very unlike the New Testament fruits of the spirit&#151;love, 
      joy, peace. And very unlike the Pauline programme: 'forgetting those things 
      which are behind and reaching forth unto those things that are before.'&#133;I 
      know that a spiritual emetic at the right moment may be needed. But not 
      a regular diet of emetics! If one survived, one would develop a 'tolerance' 
      of them. This poring over the 'sink' might breed its own perverse pride.&quot;

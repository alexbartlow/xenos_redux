    (27) but a certain terrifying expectation of judgment, and THE FURY OF A FIRE 
    WHICH WILL CONSUME THE ADVERSARIES. (28) Anyone who has set aside the Law 
    of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. (29) 
    How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled 
    under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant 
    by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace? (30) For 
    we know Him who said, &quot;VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY.&quot; And again,

      insulting the Spirit's conviction about Jesus&#151;<i>not</i> simply any 
      sin we might purposefully commit. </font></p>

  </ul>
  <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Catholic system is wrong 
    in three important areas. </font></strong> 
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>First, <i>it holds that 
      forgiveness is actually conveyed through the rituals (sacramentalism)</i>, 
      </strong>while the Bible insists that personal faith alone secures saving 
      grace<strong>.</strong> The Old Covenant system never dispensed true forgiveness; 
      it was only an incomplete picture of the once-and-for-all forgiveness bought 
      by Christ which we can receive once-for-all (Heb. 10:10-14). </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Second, <i>it holds to a 
      special caste of priests</i>.</strong> In the New Covenant, all true Christians 
      are priests in the full sense of the word because we all have direct access 
      to God through Christ (Heb. 10:19-22) and because we all can communicate 
      God's grace to others through the Word (1 Pet. 2:9). &nbsp; This doctrine 
      is referred to as the &quot;priesthood of all believers.&quot; Christ is 
      our only mediator (1 Tim. 2:5)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Third, <i>it reverts to 
      the ritualism of the Old Covenant</i></strong>, which Heb. 9 insists has 
      been fulfilled and made obsolete by the finished work of Christ. This highly 
      ritualistic way of relating to God, which was appropriate in the Old Covenant 
      because of its instructional value, has been replaced by the centrality 
      of a personal relationship with God through the indwelling Holy Spirit (Gal. 
      4:3-11). Ritual in the New Covenant has a much smaller role because of this 
      (from hundreds of prescribed rituals to two; from strictly regulated rituals 
      to loosely regulated). </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Important qualification: </strong>We 
    are not saying that there are no saved Catholics! There are, in fact, many 
    Catholics know the Lord and serve him. We are simply saying that they are 
    saved and serving <i>in spite of</i> Catholic theology, not <i>because</i> 
    of it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Practical Advice:</strong> 
    Don't go out and attack your Catholic family and friends! Many Catholics don't 
    even know what their church teaches. Instead, emphasize the biblical teaching 
    on salvation as a free gift and your personal testimony. Many get saved from 
    this, and then begin to see for themselves that their old church was off in 
    its teaching . . . </font></p>

<h3><strong><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name="a8"></a>3: Water Baptism</font></strong></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Many people and denominations teach 
    that water baptism is necessary for salvation. Passages such as Acts 2:38, 
    Mark 16:16, 1 Peter 3:21, Romans 6:3,4 and Col. 2:12 seem to teach this position. 
    However, on closer examination, this teaching is not scriptural for the following 
    reasons: </font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>The biblical teaching on salvation 
    by grace through faith alone is very clear</strong> (John 1:12; Eph 2:8,9; 
    Acts 16:30,31; Romans 3:24; Titus 3:5).<br>
    </font></li>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Gal. 2:16</strong> is especially 
    significant in light of its historical setting. Paul is refuting the Judaizers' 
    insistence that faith in Christ is not sufficient for salvation, but that 
    circumcision is also required. These are parallel teachings in that both require 
    submission to a biblical ritual for salvation. </font></p>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Passages used to support this 
    teaching can be harmonized to the &quot;salvation by faith alone&quot; position 
    described above.</strong><br>
    </font></li>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Acts 2:38 </strong>gives two 
    imperatives (&quot;repent&quot; and &quot;be baptized&quot;), followed by 
    two results (&quot;forgiveness of sins&quot; and &quot;you shall receive the 
    gift of the Holy Spirit&quot;). Note that in Peter's next speech (Acts 3:19), 
    he gives one imperative (&quot;repent and return&quot;) and promises the same 
    two results (&quot;sins wiped away&quot; and &quot;times of refreshing from 
    God's presence&quot;). If water baptism is required for forgiveness and the 
    Holy Spirit, why did Peter omit this imperative? Therefore, it is best to 
    understand the promises of Acts 2:38 as connected to the command to &quot;repent&quot; 
    alone. Peter also announced that it is God's will for believers to be water 
    baptized, but he did not mean that baptism was necessary for salvation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Mark 16:16</strong> is part 
    of the &quot;long ending&quot; of Mark (vs 9-20) that was not part of the 
    original text. For more information on this textual issue, see Mark Lane, 
    <i>The Gospel According to Mark </i>(Grand Rapids: Eerdmans Publishing Co., 
    1974), pp.&nbsp;601-605.</font></p>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>In 1 Pet.&nbsp;3:21</strong>, 
    Peter says, &quot;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;corresponding to that, baptism now 
    saves you.&quot; The &quot;that&quot; refers to how God rescued Noah and his 
    family from the flood (vs. 20). &quot;Corresponding&quot; is <i>antitupon</i>, 
    or &quot;anti-type.&quot; Peter thus identifies the ark rescue as a prophetic 
    type of our rescue through Christ. Noah and his family were NOT saved by being 
    water baptized, but by being put into (baptized into) the <i>ark</i>. In the 
    same way, believers in Christ are rescued from God's judgment by being put 
    into (baptized into) Christ. Therefore, the &quot;baptism&quot; in vs. 21 
    refers to the baptism by the Holy Spirit into Christ (see 1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;12:13), 
    not water baptism. Peter seems intent on making this point by adding &quot;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
    not the removal of dirt from the flesh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Rom.&nbsp;6:3,4 and Col.&nbsp;2:12</strong> 
    both refer to Spirit-baptism into Christ rather than to water baptism, since 
    Paul says clearly in 1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;12:13 that Spirit-baptism is the baptism 
    that unites us with Christ.</font></p>

  <li><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Consider also these additional 
    points: </font></strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>In Acts&nbsp;10:47</strong>, 
    Cornelius and his household receive the Holy Spirit immediately when they 
    believe the gospel. Peter insists that they be allowed to undergo water baptism 
    because they have receive the Spirit. Since receiving the Holy Spirit is synonymous 
    with salvation and necessary in order to be a Christian (Rom.&nbsp;8:9), water 
    baptism clearly had no bearing on their salvation. If this was the case with 
    Cornelius and his household, why would God change something this important?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>In 1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;1:17</strong>, 
    Paul says, &quot;Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel.&quot; 
    How could Paul say this if water baptism was necessary for salvation? Paul 
    believed Christians should be baptized, but he obviously saw baptism as so 
    much less important than explaining the gospel that he could pit them against 
    each other in this verse. Why? Because the gospel saves when people believe 
    it (Rom.&nbsp;1:16), while water baptism does not save.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Is water baptism required 
    or not? </font></strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Yes and No. Clearly Jesus commanded 
    us to be baptized and to baptize (Matt.&nbsp;28:19). In this sense, baptism 
    is required. We should be baptized after receiving Christ because Jesus has 
    told us to proclaim our faith in him in this way. But, as we have seen above, 
    baptism is not required for salvation. Like many other commands in scripture, 
    we should obey them out of gratitude for our salvation, not as requirements 
    for our salvation.</font></p>

    be difficult but it is nevertheless true: salvation is both free and costly 
    . . . It (saving faith) is an exchange of all that we are for all that Christ 
    is. And it denotes implicit obedience, full surrender to the lordship of Christ. 
    Nothing less can qualify as saving faith . . . This is the kind of totally 
    committed response the Lord Jesus called for. A desire to follow him at any 
    cost. Absolute surrender. A full exchange of self for the Savior. It is the

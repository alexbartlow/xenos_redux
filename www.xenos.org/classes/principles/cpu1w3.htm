<h3><strong><font face="Arial" size="3">Introduction</font></strong></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Definition: </strong>Anthropology is the
  study of human nature. Biblical anthropology focuses on the Bible's revelation about
  humans, especially our <i>original design </i>(CREATION), our <i>present abnormal state </i>(FALL),
  and the <i>effect of our salvation </i>through Christ (REDEMPTION). We will focus on the
  first two areas tonight; the third area will be covered extensively later . . . </font></p>

  <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Importance: </font></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It helps us understand more about God, since we
      are created in God's image. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It helps us understand sanctification, since
      Christians are &quot;being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the One
      who created him&quot; (Col. 3:10). It also helps us to manage our expectations about
      perfectionism in this life, realizing we won't be fully restored to God's image until we
      are with him. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">How we view human nature will affect practical
      areas like PARENTING (discipline), DELEGATED AUTHORITY (its importance in a fallen world),
      SOCIAL ETHICS (sexuality; abortion; euthanasia), PSYCHOLOGY (our main problem), our
      response to SUFFERING, etc. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It helps us understand contradictions we see in
      people (both noble qualities and wickedness). People are made in God's image, but deeply
      fallen.&nbsp; If we only see people's fallenness we can justify mistreating them.&nbsp; On
      the other hand if we only see the image of God, then we are unable to see that they need
      God's truth.</font></li>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">What is the significance of the tree of the
  knowledge of good and evil? It's not a story about a magical fruit. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil represented the choice to trust God to
  define good and evil versus arrogating that choice to ourselves (&quot;become like
  God&quot;).&nbsp; In this sense, Satan's promise that eating it would make them like God
  (3:5) was true (see God's affirmation of this in 3:22)--but it also was an act of
  rebellion against God's loving rulership which had disastrous consequences for Adam and
  Eve and all their descendants . . .</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Teacher's Note: </strong>(Not 
      presented to class) There is no special attention given to the tree and 
      subsequent discussion of this event in the Bible focuses on the morality 
      of Adam and Eve's decision. The forbidden fruit did not offer experiential 
      knowledge of evil. If this were the case then God would also have experiential 
      knowledge of evil. This would contradict one of God's attributes we covered 
      last week: righteousness. For an fuller discussion on this, see <i>Genesis 
      in Space in Time</i>, Francis A. Schaeffer, pp. 71-80.</font></p>

            choices affect all who descend spiritually from him. Rom. 5:12-19** 
            teaches this principle most clearly. </p>

      <font SIZE="2"><p>(Romans 5:12-19)&nbsp; Therefore, just as through one man sin entered
      into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all
      sinned-- (13) for until the Law sin was in the world; but sin is not imputed when there is
      no law. (14) Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not
      sinned in the likeness of the offense of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come. (15)
      But the free gift is not like the transgression. For if by the transgression of the one
      the many died, much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man,
      Jesus Christ, abound to the many. (16) And the gift is not like that which came through
      the one who sinned; for on the one hand the judgment arose from one transgression
      resulting in condemnation, but on the other hand the free gift arose from many
      transgressions resulting in justification. (17) For if by the transgression of the one,
      death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of
      the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ. (18) So then
      as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so through one
      act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men. (19) For as through
      the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of

        cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority?
        Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same; for it is a minister of God to
        you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for
        nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath upon the one who
        practices evil. Wherefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath,
        but also for conscience' sake.</font></p>

      and (more importantly) we remain the objects of God's redemptive love. </li>
  </ul>

    <li>We are as evil as we could possibly be. Fallen humans (including non-Christians) are

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Every area of our humanity has been adversely affected.</strong> Our bodies,
      minds, emotions, intuition, etc. have all been distorted by the Fall. </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>We would never seek for God without his prior initiative </strong>(Jn. 6:44).
      &quot;No one seeks for God&quot; on their own. The fact that we become seekers is the
      result of God in his grace seeking us and convicting us of our need for him. </li>

<h3><strong><a name="a1"></a>Introduction </strong></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Encouragement:</strong> You are now most of the way through Unit 
    1, which is the most abstract unit. Units 2- 4 are much more practical.&nbsp; 
    Hang in there!</p>
  <p><strong>Eschatology: </strong>study of the last things. We are only going 
    to be able to scratch the surface in three weeks. </p>
  <p><strong>Christians should be familiar with the main elements of the end-times. 
    </strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>There is a tremendous amount of material devoted to this subject in both 
      Old Testament and New Testament (as much as 25%). This alone suggests its 
      importance. </p>
    <p>Even though Paul was only in Thessalonica for a few weeks before he was 
      booted out, he spent part of that time grounding them in this area so that 
      he could say:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><strong>(1&nbsp;Thess.&nbsp;5:1,2)</strong> &quot;Now, brothers, about 
        times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well 
        . . . &quot; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The better we understand this area, the more motivated we can be to serve 
      the Lord with hope. We can read the end of the book and see that we're on 
      the winning side! Plus, many passages about the end of the age and the next 
      life explain how these promises should motivate us in this life. </p>
    <p>We see prophecy fulfilled in our own time (such as the regathering of Israel) 
      and our faith is affirmed. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>All orthodox (traditional) views agree on the essentials: literal 
    return of Christ, final judgment, heaven and hell.</strong> They disagree 
    on the meaning of things like the role of Israel and the nature of the &quot;millennium.&quot; 
    Tonight we will cover the BIG PICTURE on eschatology by discussing these views 
    and explaining why we hold the one we do. Next week we will examine a key 
    feature of Old Testament prophecy (double reference) and the key visions of 
    Daniel. On week 9, we will go into details about the rapture, intermediate 
    states, tribulation, beast, etc. </p>
  <p><b><strong>Covenantalism and Dispensationalism</strong></b></p>
  <p>There are really only 2 basic positions&#151;Covenantalism and Dispensationalism. 
    <strong>The terms &quot;Covenantal Theology&quot; and &quot;Dispensational 
    Theology&quot; refer to two different ways of interpreting the biblical record 
    of salvation history. </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="a2"></a><strong>Covenantal Theology</strong> </h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Covenant theology: A system of theology based upon God's covenants 
    as governing categories for the understanding of the entire bible.</strong></p>
  <p>It tends to emphasize the <em>unity</em> of God's working with mankind<strong>, 
    </strong>though both views acknowledge the important role of covenants in 
    salvation history.<strong> </strong>(&quot;Covenants&quot; are contracts between 
    two parties.) Covenant theology normally speaks of three main covenants in 
    salvation history. </p>
  <p><strong>Covenantal Theology is typical of Reformed theologians.</strong> 
    This includes the Reformed and Christian Reformed, the Presbyterian, the Anglican 
    (or Episcopal), and to some extent, Lutheran traditions. Classical Roman Catholicism 
    also recognizes the same approximate divisions of scriptural history, (differing 
    on the question of man's responsibility in the covenant of grace). Taken together 
    then, the Covenantal view must be considered by far the predominant view. 
  </p>
 
  <p><strong>1. The Covenant of Redemption (before creation): </strong></p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>The Son's obligation: </strong>Promises the Father to render perfect 
      obedience (unto death) for our sins. </p>
    <p><strong>The Father's obligation: </strong>Promises to the Son: </p>
   
    <blockquote> 
      <p>all the Son's needs will be met; </p>
      <p>the Holy Spirit will be given to the church; </p>
      <p>salvation in all of its phases will be given to all believers; </p>
      <p>the Son will be exalted and glorified. </p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
 
  <p><strong>2. The Covenant of Works (from creation until the fall): </strong></p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>Man's obligation: </strong>Adam must obey God's commands. </p>
    <p><strong>God's obligation: </strong>Rewards obedience with eternal life, 
      and punishes disobedience with death. </p>
  </blockquote>
 
  <p><strong>3. The Covenant of Grace (from the fall until the second advent): 
    </strong></p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>Man's obligation: </strong>Faith in God's promise, issuing in obedience 
      to God's commands. </p>
    <p><strong>God's obligation: </strong>Salvation in all of its phases to the 
      believer through the substitutionary work of his Son. </p>
  </blockquote>
 
  <p><strong>Comments: </strong></p>
 
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> </li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>One of the strengths of the Covenantal position is that <strong>it stresses 
      that people have always been saved by grace through faith</strong>. </p>
  </blockquote>
 
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Weaknesses: </strong></li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>One of the big problems is that <strong>it lumps everything between the 
      Fall and the Second Advent together and tends to minimize some of the important 
      differences in the way God works within that period.</strong> For example, 
      it refers to the church as beginning with the first believers in the Old 
      Testament, rather than seeing it as a distinct phase of God's redemptive 
      program beginning on the Day of Pentecost. This is why some churches feel 
      the freedom to incorporate Old Testament practices like a liturgical worship 
      service with an altar and priestly vestments. </p>

<h3><a name="a3"></a><strong>Dispensational Theology </strong></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Dispensational theology: A system of theology that stresses the differing 
    ways that God works with man in salvation history.</strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Dispensational theology tends to emphasize the <em>diversity</em> of ways 
      in which God works with mankind. </p>
    <p>&quot;Dispensations&quot; (Greek: oikonomia) refer to economies, or different 
      ways in which God works with man in salvation history (see Eph. 1:10; 3:2; 
      1 Tim. 1:4). In the classic Dispensational scheme, each dispensation begins 
      with an offer by God and ends with failure by man and a period of divine 
      judgment.</p>
    <p>The Dispensational view is of more recent origin, arising from the evangelical 
      awakening in America and England. Through the work of Jesse Penn-Lewis, 
      T. Austin Sparks, J. N. Darby (who is given credit for formally bringing 
      the view to light), Dwight Moody, C. I. Scofield (who included it in the 
      Scofield Bible), Watchman Nee, Lewis Sperry Chafer, John Walvoord, and Hal 
      Lindsey, this view has become widespread and popular today. It is the view 
      of most Pentecostals, Brethren, many Baptists, and most independent Bible 
      churches. </p>

  <p align="center"><strong>Seven Classic Dispensations</strong></p>
  <p><img src="../../graphics/dispensational.gif" width="623" height="184"></p>
  <p><strong>1. Innocence, or Untested Holiness (Genesis 1-3): </strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>God offers man eternal life for obedience. </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Man rebels, and is expelled from the Garden of Eden. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>2. Conscience (Genesis 4-6): </strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>God offers to govern man through his conscience. </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Man sears his conscience, and God brings the universal flood. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>3. Government (Genesis 7-11): </strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>God offers to govern man through civil government (Genesis 9:6). </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Man corrupts civil government, and God brings the confusion of tongues 
      and scatters man. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>4. Promise (Genesis 12 &#151; Millennial Kingdom): </strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>God promises to bless Abraham and his descendants, and all nations through 
      them. </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Jacob's sons apostatize and God brings them into slavery in Egypt. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>5. Law (Exodus 20 &#151; Millennial Kingdom): </strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>God promises to grant Israel the promises he made to Abraham conditional 
      to their obedience to his Law. </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Israel apostatizes, undergoes exile and dispersion, and is finally purified 
      through the Great Tribulation. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>6. Grace or The Church Age (Pentecost &#151; Rapture): </strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>God <strong>temporarily</strong> suspends working through Israel as his 
      chosen nation and offers to work through all believers in Jesus. </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>The church apostatizes and is judged in the Great Tribulation after true 
      believers are rescued through the Rapture. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>7. Millennial Kingdom (Revelation 20): </strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>God fulfills all of his promises to national Israel after the Second Coming 
      of Jesus. </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Satan ignites a rebellion against Jesus, which God terminates and then 
      judges all men at the Great White Throne. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Comments: </strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> 
      <p><strong>We believe this view is superior to Covenantalism in several 
        key areas</strong>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Dispensationalism is committed to a <em>literal hermeneutic</em> 
            when interpreting biblical prophecy. </strong>They have aroused lots 
            of interest in this area of biblical truth.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Dispensationalists emphasize that the primary application 
            of an Old Testament passage is to the original audience (e.g. OT priestly 
            practices abandoned under the church-age dispensation).</strong>&nbsp; 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Weaknesses: </strong></li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>Some of the early dispensations seem to be forced.</strong> Paul 
      seems to lump everything from Adam to Moses together (Rom. 5:14). More recent 
      Dispensationalists (Progressive Dispensationalism) have moved away from 
      these rigid distinctions. </p>
    <p><strong>Some Dispensationalists have also given this view a bad name by 
      getting overly dogmatic about how certain passages must be fulfilled </strong>(LINDSEY 
      SAYING REV. 9:7-10 REFERS TO MILITARY HELICOPTERS), setting dates for Christ's 
      return (&quot;88 REASONS WHY CHRIST MUST RETURN BY 1988&quot;), etc. </p>
    <p><strong>It has a negative cast </strong>(judgments ending each dispensation) 
      when in fact God is progressively accomplishing his redemptive plan.</p>
    <p><strong>Some dispensationalists overlook pressing social issues </strong>because 
      they believe the world is getting worse and worse and that our role is primarily 
      to rescue the lost (e.g. painting a sinking ship).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong><a name="a4"></a>Summary: <font size="-1">At Xenos we do not agree 
    with Classic (Scofieldian) Dispensationalism. We identify ourselves more with 
    the progressive dispensationalist (Darell Bock. Christianity Today. September 
    12,1994. p. 26-29.) We acknowledge the unity of God's working through history 
    and through Israel, but we see a clear distinction between the Old and New 
    Covenants that lead to the following key theological distinctions.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="+1">Key Theological Distinctions</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong>1. How does the Covenantal-Dispensational view affect <em>Ecclesiology</em>? 
    </strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>Covenantal:</strong> Covenantalists define the church as all believers 
      during all of history. Therefore, like Roman Catholicism, <strong>they often 
      feel free to use Old Testament material in church structure</strong>, which 
      leads to things like infant baptism, religious calendars, ritualism, etc. 
      At different times in history, some covenantalists have equated their nations 
      and city states with God's people (e.g. New England Puritans).</p>
    <p><strong>Dispensational:</strong> Because Dispensationalists <strong>see 
      the Church Age as a distinct period in salvation history</strong> (beginning 
      on Pentecost), they usually call for a more radical break with Old Testament 
      worship and structures. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>2. How does the Covenantal-Dispensational view affect <i>Soteriology</i>? 
    </strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>Covenantal:</strong> Many Covenantalists place more <strong>emphasis 
      on the Law</strong> in sanctification. </p>
    <p><strong>Dispensational:</strong> Dispensationalists tend to <strong>stress 
      grace</strong> in this area, as we will see in Unit 2 . . . </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>3. How does the Covenantal-Dispensational view affect <i>Pneumatology</i>? 
    </strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>Covenantal:</strong> Some Covenantalists believe the Holy Spirit 
      <strong>indwelt believers in the Old Covenant</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Dispensational:</strong> Dispensationalists say the <strong>Holy 
      Spirit indwelt believers <em>only after</em> Jesus' death on the cross</strong>. 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>4. How does the Covenantal-Dispensational view affect <i>Eschatology</i>? 
    </strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>It determines how you view the <i>millennium</i> and <i>Israel's 
      future role</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; </strong></p>
    <p><strong><a name="a5"></a>In recent years, representatives from both groups 
      have moderated their positions. </strong></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><strong>Covenantal:</strong> Covenantalists have acknowledged <strong>more 
        distinction</strong> <strong>between the Old Covenant and New Covenant</strong>. 
        They also reject the notion of a literal thousand year millenial kingdom 
        after Christ returns and a future role for national Israel. See more on 
        this under Amillennialism and Postmillennialism below.</p>
      <p><strong>Dispensational:</strong> Dispensationalists have acknowledged 
        <strong>more unity</strong> <strong>between the periods</strong>.</p>

<h3><strong>Key Millennial Kingdom Passages</strong></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> What is the millennial kingdom? There are many 
    biblical passages, in both the Old Testament and the New Testament, that describe 
    <strong>a future period of human history in which God substantially reconciles 
    the world to himself and reigns over the world through the Messiah and his 
    people Israel. </strong>Consider these passages, and write down in your Bible's 
    margin the key characteristics of this period. </p>
  <p><b>(Psa.&nbsp;2:6,8,9)</b> I have installed my King on Zion, my holy hill. 
    (8)Ask of me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the 
    earth your possession. (9) You will rule them with an iron scepter; you will 
    dash them to pieces like pottery.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>Messiah rules a worldwide theocracy centered in Jerusalem. </strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>(Isa. 65:17-25)</b> &quot;Behold, I will create <strong>new heavens and 
    a new earth</strong>. The former things will not be remembered, nor will they 
    come to mind. (18) But be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create, 
    for I will create Jerusalem to be a delight and its people a joy. (19) I will 
    rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my people; the sound of weeping 
    and of crying will be heard in it no more. (20) Never again will there be 
    in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not live 
    out his years; he who dies at a hundred will be thought a mere youth; he who 
    fails to reach a hundred will be considered accursed. (21) They will build 
    houses and dwell in them; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit. (22) 
    No longer will they build houses and others live in them, or plant and others 
    eat. For as the days of a tree, so will be the days of my people; my chosen 
    ones will long enjoy the works of their hands. (23) They will not toil in 
    vain or bear children doomed to misfortune; for they will be a people blessed 
    by the LORD, they and their descendants with them. (24) Before they call I 
    will answer; while they are still speaking I will hear. (25) The wolf and 
    the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, but 
    dust will be the serpent's food. They will neither harm nor destroy on all 
    my holy mountain,&quot; says the LORD.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>&quot;New heavens and new earth&quot; here refer (according to 
      the following context) to the millennial kingdom rather than the new universe 
      of</strong> Rev. 21,22. In both Isaiah and Revelation the &quot;new heavens 
      and new earth&quot; refer to a <i>new era</i> in God's dealing with humanity. 
      It is not a specific term that relates to only a specific period of history.</p>
    <p><strong>Isaiah refers here to the millennial kingdom and pictures it as 
      a time of joy, peace, and economic prosperity. Jerusalem is exalted.</strong> 
      The curse on nature (including human sickness) will be substantially (though 
      not entirely) removed. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>(Zeph. 3:11-13)</b> On that day you will not be put to shame for all the 
    wrongs you have done to me, because I will remove from this city those who 
    rejoice in their pride. Never again will you be haughty on my holy hill. (12) 
    But I will leave within you the meek and humble, who trust in the name of 
    the LORD. (13) The remnant of Israel will do no wrong; they will speak no 
    lies, nor will deceit be found in their mouths. They will eat and lie down 
    and no one will make them afraid.&quot;</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>The wicked will be separated from the righteous, who enjoy unending 
      (&quot;never again&quot;) peace and security. </strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>(Zech. 14:16-19) </strong>Then the survivors from all the nations 
    that have attacked Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, 
    the LORD Almighty, and to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles. (17) If any 
    of the peoples of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, 
    the LORD Almighty, they will have no rain. (18) If the Egyptian people do 
    not go up and take part, they will have no rain. The LORD will bring on them 
    the plague he inflicts on the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast 
    of Tabernacles. (19) This will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment 
    of all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles. 
  </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>The Messiah rules in Jerusalem and executes swift justice on those 
      who oppose him. </strong>There is some observance of the Jewish religious 
      calendar. </p>
    <p><b>The following section on feasts is an aside for teacher's reference</b></p>
    <p><b>Feast of Tabernacles:</b></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><strong>The fourth annual festival was the feast of tabernacles</strong> 
        (2 Chron. 8:13; Ezra 3:4; Zech. 14:16), also called the feast of ingathering 
        (Ex. 23:16; 34:22), the feast to the Lord (Lev. 23:39; Judg. 21:19). Sometimes 
        it was simply called &quot;the feast&quot; (1 Kings 8:2; 2 Chron. 5:3; 
        7:8; Neh. 8:14; Isa. 30:29; Ezek. 45:23,25) because it was so well known. 
        Its observance combined the ingathering of the labor of the field (Ex. 
        23:16), the fruit of the earth (Lev. 23:39), the ingathering of the threshingfloor 
        and winepress (Deut. 16:13), and the dwelling in booths (or &quot;tabernacles&quot;), 
        which were to be joyful reminders to Israel (Lev. 23:41; Deut. 16:14). 
        The &quot;booth&quot; in Scripture is not an image of privation and misery, 
        but of protection, preservation, and shelter from heat and storm (Pss. 
        27:5; 31:20; Isa. 4:6). The rejoicing community included family, servants, 
        widows, orphans, Levites, and sojourners (Deut. 16:13-15). </p>
      <p><strong>The feast began on the fifteenth day of Tishri </strong>(the 
        seventh month), which was five days after the day of atonement. It lasted 
        for seven days (Lev. 23:36; Deut. 16:13; Ezek. 45:25). On the first day, 
        booths were constructed of fresh branches of trees. Each participant had 
        to collect twigs of myrtle, willow, and palm in the area of Jerusalem 
        for construction of the booths (Neh. 8:13-18). Every Israelite was to 
        live for seven days in these during the festival, in commemoration of 
        when their fathers lived in such booths after their Exodus from Egypt 
        (Lev. 23:40; Neh. 8:15). The dedication of Solomon's Temple took place 
        at the feast (1 Kings 8:2). </p>
      <p><strong>After the return from Exile, Ezra read the law and led the people 
        in acts of penitence during this feast</strong> (Neh. 8:13-18). Later, 
        Josephus referred to it as the holiest and greatest of the Hebrew feasts. 
        Later additions to the ritual included a libation of water drawn from 
        the pool of Siloam (the probable background for Jesus' comments on &quot;living 
        water,&quot; John 7:37-39) and the lighting of huge Menorahs (candelabra) 
        at the Court of the Women (the probable background for Jesus' statement, 
        &quot;I am the light of the world,&quot; John 8:12). The water and the 
        &quot;pillar of light&quot; provided during the wilderness wandering (when 
        the people dwelt in tabernacles) was temporary and in contrast to the 
        continuing water and light claimed by Jesus during this feast which commemorated 
        that wandering period. </p>
      <p><strong>The eschatological visions which speak of the coming of all nations 
        to worship at Jerusalem refer to the feast of booths on the occasion of 
        their pilgrimage</strong> (Zech. 14:16-21). <br>
        (Holman's Bible Dictionary- Article on Festivals)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>(Rev. 20:1-10)</b> And I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having 
    the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. (2) And he laid hold of 
    the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him 
    for <strong>a thousand years</strong>, (3) and threw him into the abyss, and 
    shut it and sealed it over him, so that he should not deceive the nations 
    any longer, until the thousand years were completed; after these things he 
    must be released for a short time. (4) I saw thrones on which were seated 
    those who had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those 
    who had been beheaded because of their testimony for Jesus and because of 
    the word of God. They had not worshipped the beast or his image and had not 
    received his mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and 
    reigned with Christ a thousand years. (5) (The rest of the dead did not come 
    to life <strong>until the thousand years were ended</strong>.) This is the 
    first resurrection. (6) Blessed and holy are those who have part in the first 
    resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests 
    of God and of Christ and will reign with him for <strong>a thousand years</strong>. 
    (7) <strong>When the thousand years are over</strong>, Satan will be released 
    from his prison (8) and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners 
    of the earth&#151;Gog and Magog&#151;to gather them for battle. In number 
    they are like the sand on the seashore. (9) They marched across the breadth 
    of the earth and surrounded the camp of God's people, the city he loves. But 
    fire came down from heaven and devoured them. (10) And the devil, who deceived 
    them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the 
    false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever 
    and ever.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>This is the only passage that specifies the duration as 1000 years.</strong> 
      Some of the saints are resurrected at the beginning, and they play a priestly 
      and governing role in this kingdom. &quot;First resurrection&quot; refers 
      in context to the first resurrection described in this passage&#151;the 
      resurrection of the tribulational martyrs. The second resurrection is the 
      resurrection of the damned at the Great White Throne. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Realize that the above passages are only a small minority of the 
    biblical material on this subject.</strong> There are <i>hundreds</i> of passages 
    in the Old Testament alone devoted to this kingdom, which (along with Messiah) 
    is the hope of Israel.</p>
  <p>As you read these passages, how should you interpret them&#151;literally 
    or figuratively? This is one of the crucial differences between Covenantalism 
    and Dispensationalism. Dispensationalism insists that these passages will 
    be literally fulfilled for Israel, while Covenantalism says they are being 
    fulfilled figuratively for the Church, or that they will be fulfilled figuratively 
    in the eternal state. </p>

<p><strong>Definition: </strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>The millennial kingdom will not literally appear </strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Role of Israel:</strong> </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>This view holds that because Israel rejected her Messiah, the Church 
      has inherited the promises that were originally given to Israel.</strong> 
      <i>This means that <strong>Israel no longer has any special place in the 
      plan of God</strong>.</i> The Old Testament millennial kingdom promises 
      are being fulfilled by the church in a spiritualized rather than literal 
      way. The amillennial position is that the millennial kingdom will never 
      appear in any literal way. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>View of the Church:</strong> </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>The Church is &quot;spiritual Israel&quot;</strong> (Romans 2:28,29; 
      Philippians 3:3; Galatians 6:16) <strong>which has inherited <i>all</i> 
      of God's unfulfilled promises to Israel.</strong> Satan is already bound 
      as predicted in Revelation 20:2.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>View of the Kingdom:</strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>The kingdom is &quot;in our midst&quot;</strong> (Luke 17:21). 
      Often, the amillennialist believes in a final intensification of evil (although 
      not usually of seven literal years) preceding the Second Advent. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong><strong>History: </strong></strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>This view has its roots in the early church fathers (Origen and 
      Augustine) after Constantine &quot;Christianized&quot; the Roman Empire. 
      They were predisposed to view the millennial kingdom as synonymous to the 
      Holy Roman Empire</strong>, and their allegorical method of interpretation 
      opened the door for this kind of understanding. Anti-Semitism was also a 
      factor driving this interpretation, although present-day Amillennialists 
      are not anti-Semitic. It was accepted as the official position at the Council 
      of Ephesus in 431, at which time belief in a literal millennium was condemned 
      as superstitious. The Reformers accepted the amillennialist framework without 
      essential change. Today, it is the dominant view in those sections of the

  <blockquote> 
    <p>In the post-millennial view, <strong>the Church will progressively &quot;Christianize&quot; 
      the world (meaning Christianity will hold influence over society) ushering 
      in a period of peace and prosperity.</strong> This is the so-called millennial 
      kingdom, but it is not 1000 years and does not literally fulfill the Old 
      Testament passages like the ones above. After this period, Christ will return 
      (according to some versions) to judge the world and usher in the eternal 
      state. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Role of Israel and the Church: </strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>Post-millennialism, like amillennialism, holds that the church 
      has inherited a spiritualized fulfillment of Israel's kingdom promises. 
      </strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>History:</strong> </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>This view is not widely held today</strong>. This view finds important 
      theological precedent in the early and medieval Roman Catholic church, when 
      they identified themselves with the kingdom of God. It was also popular 
      during the 18th and 19th centuries, corresponding to the ascendancy of optimistic 
      humanism. Subsequent historical events (WW I, WW II, Cold War, Marxism, 
      etc.) have dashed hopes for a period of world peace apart from God's supernatural 
      intervention. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Critique of Post- &amp; Amillennialism</strong></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Both critiques center on the importance of a consistently literal 
    hermeneutic for eschatological passages.</strong></p>
 
  <p><strong>1. Post- and amillennialism interpret the Old Testament prophecies 
    of the first Advent <i>literally</i>, but they interpret the Old Testament 
    prophecies of the second Advent <i>figuratively</i>. </strong></p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>(Zech.&nbsp;14:1-7)</b> Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the 
      spoil taken from you will be divided among you. (2) For I will gather all 
      the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, 
      the houses plundered, the women ravished, and half of the city exiled, but 
      the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. (3) Then the LORD 
      will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day 
      of battle. (4) And in that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, 
      which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will 
      be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that 
      half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward 
      the south. (5) And you will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the 
      valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you 
      fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the 
      LORD, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him! (6) And it will 
      come about in that day that there will be no light; the luminaries will 
      dwindle. (7) For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither 
      day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be 
      light.</p>
   
    <p><b>Dispensationalists: </b>Interpret this as a literal Battle between God 
      and earthly kingdoms when Christ returns (his second advent).</p>
   
    <p><b>Allegorical Amillennial: </b>interpretation is represented by Matthew 
      Henry's commentary on Zech. 14:1-7</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><b>(Commentary, verse 2, 4, 5)</b> &quot;Many of the Jews shall receive 
        the gospel, and so shall prevent their being cut off from the city of 
        God, his church upon earth&#133;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;(4, 5) the Gentiles 
        (will be) made one with the Jews by the breaking down of this middle wall 
        of partition (Eph.&nbsp;2:14). A great mountain of the ceremonial law 
        was in the way of the Jews' conversion, yet before Christ and his 
        gospel it was made plain&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The mountain being 
        divided, one-half towards the north and the other half towards the south, 
        there shall be a very great valley (means) a broad way of communication 
        between Jerusalem and the Gentile world, by which the Gentiles shall have 
        free admission into the gospel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The valley of 
        the mountains is the gospel-church, to which are added of the Jews daily 
        such as should be saved&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&quot; (Matthew Henry, 
        <i>1-Volume Commentary on the Whole Bible</i> [Grand Rapids: Zondervan 
        Publishing House, 1961], p.&nbsp;1191).</p>
     
      <p><strong>This hermeneutic leaves the interpreter in authority over the 
        scripture. In addition, vast portions of scripture become unintelligible 
        and therefore useless. </strong></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
 
  <p><strong>2. Both the Old and New Testaments explicitly state that God will 
    fulfill all of his promises to Israel. </strong></p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>Old Testament</strong></p>
   
    <blockquote> 
      <p><b>(Jer. 31:31-37**) </b>&quot;The time is coming,&quot; declares the 
        LORD, &quot;when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and 
        with the house of Judah. (32) It will not be like the covenant I made 
        with their forefathers when I took them by the hand to lead them out of 
        Egypt, because they broke my covenant, though I was a husband to them, 
        &quot; declares the LORD. (33) &quot;This is the covenant I will make 
        with the house of Israel after that time,&quot; declares the LORD. &quot;I 
        will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be 
        their God, and they will be my people. (34) No longer will a man teach 
        his neighbor, or a man his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' because they 
        will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest,&quot; declares 
        the LORD. &quot;For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember 
        their sins no more. (35) This is what the LORD says, he who appoints the 
        sun to shine by day, who decrees the moon and stars to shine by night, 
        who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar&#151; the LORD Almighty is his 
        name: (36) &quot;Only if these decrees vanish from my sight,&quot; declares 
        the LORD, &quot;<b>will the descendants of Israel ever cease to be a nation 
        before me.&quot; (</b>37) This is what the LORD says: &quot;Only if the 
        heavens above can be measured and the foundations of the earth below be 
        searched out will I reject all the descendants of Israel because of all 
        they have done,&quot; declares the LORD.</p>
     
      <blockquote> 
        <p>God will no more revoke his covenant with Israel than he will revoke 
          his decree to make the sun and moon shine. In other words, <strong>this 
          covenant is in force for as long as this world lasts</strong>. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b>(Isa. 54:9-17)</b> &quot;To me this is like the days of Noah, when 
        I swore that the waters of Noah would never again cover the earth. So 
        now I have sworn not to be angry with you, never to rebuke you again. 
        (10) <b>Though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed,</b> <b>yet 
        my unfailing love for you will not be shaken nor my covenant of peace 
        be removed</b>,&quot; says the LORD, who has compassion on you. (11) &quot;O 
        afflicted city, lashed by storms and not comforted, I will build you with 
        stones of turquoise, your foundations with sapphires. (12) I will make 
        your battlements of rubies, your gates of sparkling jewels, and all your 
        walls of precious stones. (13) All your sons will be taught by the LORD, 
        and great will be your children's peace. (14) In righteousness you will 
        be established: Tyranny will be far from you; you will have nothing to 
        fear. Terror will be far removed; it will not come near you. (15) If anyone 
        does attack you, it will not be my doing; whoever attacks you will surrender 
        to you. (16) See, it is I who created the blacksmith who fans the coals 
        into flame and forges a weapon fit for its work. And it is I who have 
        created the destroyer to work havoc; (17) no weapon forged against you 
        will prevail, and you will refute every tongue that accuses you. This 
        is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and this is their vindication 
        from me,&quot; declares the LORD.</p>
     
      <blockquote> 
        <p><strong>In the same way that God will be faithful to keep the covenant 
          to Noah (never to destroy the world again by flood), he will be just 
          as faithful to keep his covenant promises to Israel. </strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>See also Ezekiel 36:22-38; 37: 1-14; 39: 28-29; Joel 2: 28-3:21.</p>
    </blockquote>
   
    <p><strong>New Testament </strong></p>
   
    <blockquote> 
      <p><b>(Matt.&nbsp;19:27,28)</b> Peter answered him, &quot;We have left everything 
        to follow you! What then will there be for us?&quot; (28) Jesus said to 
        them, &quot;I tell you the truth, at the renewal of all things, when the 
        Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will 
        also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&quot;</p>
     
      <blockquote> 
        <p><strong>Note that Jesus assumes a literal fulfillment of the millennial 
          kingdom as the Old Testament describes it. </strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b>(Rom. 9:3-5)</b> For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut 
        off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, those of my own race, the 
        people of Israel. (4) Theirs is the adoption as sons; theirs the divine 
        glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and 
        the promises. (5) Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the 
        human ancestry of Christ, who is God over all, forever praised! Amen.</p>
     
      <blockquote> 
        <p><strong>Notice that Paul uses the present tense (&quot;is&quot; and 
          &quot;are&quot;) rather than the past tense (&quot;was&quot; and &quot;were&quot;) 
          to describe Jews' covenant privileges. </strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b>(Romans 11:25-29*)</b> I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, 
        brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening 
        in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in. And so all 
        Israel will be saved, as it is written: &quot;The deliverer will come 
        from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob. And this is my covenant 
        with them when I take away their sins.&quot; As far as the gospel is concerned, 
        they are enemies on your account; but as far as election is concerned, 
        they are loved on account of the patriarchs, <strong>for God's gifts and 
        his call are irrevocable.</strong></p>
     
      <blockquote> 
        <p><strong>Paul is crystal clear here that God will never revoke his calling 
          of Israel or their role in the millennial kingdom. </strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>See also Matthew&nbsp;24:20ff.; Luke&nbsp;21:24; 2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:4ff; 
        Revelation&nbsp;7:3-8; 11:2 for excellent evidence to support this view.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition: </strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>Jesus will return to judge the wicked and establish a literal 1000 
      year reign on earth (the Millennial Kingdom).</strong> This view holds that 
      the present age is preceding the literal theocratic rule of Christ on earth 
      as foretold in the Old Testament and affirmed in the New Testament..</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Role of Israel and the church: </strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>The Church, it is claimed, partakes <i>partially</i> in the promises 
      given to Israel, </strong>by virtue of the fact that we are &quot;spiritual 
      Israel,&quot;<strong> but the literal and complete fulfillment of those 
      promises are still to be expected at a later date. </strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Interpretation of the &quot;Kingdom&quot; passages:</strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Premillennialists claim that prophecies concerning the second Advent <strong>can 
      be and should be interpreted according to the same hermeneutical restrictions 
      as applied to the predictions of the First Advent.</strong> As a result 
      of this literal interpretation of unfulfilled prophecy, premillennialism 
      has a much more detailed doctrine of the end-times. While it agrees that 
      God's kingdom has a present aspect, it insists the the kingdom in its fulness 
      will come only at Christ's future bodily return. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>History: </strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>T<strong>he early post-apostolic church, as evidenced by the writings of 
      early church leaders, was pre-millennial.</strong> However, as G. E. Ladd 
      and amillennialists have repeatedly pointed out, their end-times scenario 
      was not well developed. Even if this point is granted, it still cannot be 
      argued that they were amillennial. After going into eclipse after the time 
      of Augustine (along with a literal hermeneutic), this view <strong>reappeared 
      in the early 19th century in connection with the Plymouth Brethren and the 
      rise of Dispensationalism</strong>. Since then, it has been popularized 
      by authors such as C. I. Scofield, L. S. Chafer, John Walvoord, Dwight Pentecost, 
      and Hal Lindsey. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b><strong>Critique of Pre-Millennialism (Dispensational)</strong></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b><strong>1.&nbsp; There are clear instances in which the New Testament 
    authors say that the Church has received a spiritual (non-literal) fulfillment 
    of promises originally intended for the nation of Israel. </strong>(Joel 2:28-32 
    in Acts 2:16ff.; Jeremiah 31:31-34 in Hebrews 10:16,17)</b></p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>This does not prove that there is no literal fulfillment of those 
      same passages.</strong> Dispensationalists respond that <strong>these are 
      examples of <i>partial</i> fulfillment</strong>, and that the partial fulfillment 
      pointed out in the Church Age does not negate the literal fulfillment at 
      the 2nd Advent (see Rom. 9-11). We will take a closer look at this phenomenon 
      next week. </p>
  </blockquote>
 
  <p><strong>2.&nbsp; Premillennialists have difficulty presenting a consistent 
    interpretation of all predictive prophecies. </strong></p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The differing views on Ezek 37,38 are cited. <strong>Since the amount of 
      material involved makes it difficult to harmonize all of them, it is unlikely 
      that we will understand how they all fit together until that time</strong> 
      (Dan. 12:4,8-10). For this reason, we should <strong>stick with the main 
      and clear features of the end-times</strong> and avoid dogmatism about many 
      of the details. </p>
    <p>At least Dispensationalists try, using hermeneutical principles, to present 
      a consistent interpretation of all the predictive prophecies rather than 
      interpreting them allegorically or ignoring them altogether!</p>
  </blockquote>
 
  <p><strong>3. Amillennialists hold that the millennium cannot be literal, since 
    it involves animal sacrifice (see Ezekiel 40-48), which allegedly contradicts 
    the argument of Hebrews. </strong></p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>Dispensationalists view these sacrifices as commemorative of Jesus 
      Christ's sacrifice</strong>, just as the Last Supper is for the Church. 
      Thus, animal sacrifice functions as a foreshadowing of Christ's death 
      under the Old Covenant, while it functions as a commemoration under the 
      New Covenant. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Memory Verses </strong></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Jer. 31:31-37** -</strong> God's promise of the New Covenant for 
    Israel (not just for the Church) will be fulfilled. </p>
 
  <p><strong>Rom. 11:29* -</strong> God's promises to national Israel are irrevocable. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Assignment </strong></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Read Daniel 2,7,8. How many kingdoms does Daniel predict? What are the historical 
    names of these kingdoms, according to the text? How do the visions in chapter 
    7 &amp; 8 correlate to the vision in chapter 2?</p>

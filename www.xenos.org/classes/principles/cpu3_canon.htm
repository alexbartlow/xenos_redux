<h2><a name="a1">Introduction </a></h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Satan knows the power of the Word, so he attacks it. LAST WEEK: inspiration 
    . . . </p>
  <p>Why are some books in the Bible, while others were excluded? 
  <ul>
    <li>Why does the Catholic Bible have a whole extra section? What about books 
      like the Gospel of Thomas (NEW AGE)? </li>
    <li>Was it just the books that were oldest that got gradually revered? No, 
      because some were accepted immediately (while still new), while others were 
      very old but never accepted. </li>
    <li>Was the canon determined by councils of men (Jamnia, Hippo) or was it 
      determined generation by generation through acceptance of inspired writings?<br>
      Was it something decided by men at councils (Modern theory states that the 
      canon of the Old Testament was determined by the council of Jamnia (90 AD) 
      and was therefore determined by a group of Jewish rabbis. Our evidence will 
      show, on the contrary, that the canon was known and immediately recognized 
      as scripture as it developed in each generation. We know for a fact that 
      some books were disputed for periods of time. Was it majority vote that 
      weeded out dozens of other books (as the Jesus Seminar participants voted 
      to weed most of the gospels' statements by Jesus)? Was it a matter of political 
      maneuvering, getting enough supporters for certain factions' causes? In 
      this case, people are deciding what books made it into the Bible. Are the 
      postmodernists right, that the books in the Bible reflect the ideology of 
      the &quot;winners?&quot; </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Unless we are able to answer the above kinds of questions, our confidence 
    in the Word may erode, and we won't be able to answer those who raise these 
    questions (1 Pet. 3:15). If Satan introduces doubt regarding the integrity 
    of the canon, he dilutes and corrupts the authority of God's truth. This is 
    what is at stake in the subject of canonicity. </p>
  <p>&quot;Canon&quot; comes from both a Hebrew word and a Greek word that denotes 
    a &quot;measuring rod&quot; or ruler. <i>Canonicity is the study of the recognition 
    and acceptance of the books given by God's inspiration.</i> 
  <p>This is the first thing we need to understand. The criterion of canonicity 
    is inspiration. &quot;God gives divine authority to a book and men of God 
    receive it. God reveals and His people recognize what He reveals. Canonicity 
    is determined by God and discovered by man.&quot; (Norman Geisler and William 
    E. Nix, <em>From God to Man: How We Got Our Bible</em> (Chicago: Moody Press, 
    1974), Page 66.)&nbsp; Let's see how this process occurred in the Old and 
    New Testaments. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="a2">The Old Testament</a></h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Modern liberal theory states that the canon of the Old Testament was gradually 
    recognized in a series of three steps: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Pentateuch accepted as scripture by 400 BC (1000 years after Moses 
      wrote it. JEDP critics claim it is a collection of various sources compiled 
      by redactors (editors). They deny Mosaic authorship.)</li>
    <li>The Prophets by 200 BC, and </li>
    <li>The Writings not accepted until the Council of Jamnia, in 90 AD. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Our evidence will show, on the contrary, that the canon was known and immediately 
    recognized as scripture as it developed in each generation. </p>
  <h3>CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE CANON </h3>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The criteria used to determine whether a book was part of the canon of 
      the Old Testament was <i>prophetic authorship</i>. During Old Testament 
      times, God inspired the prophets as his official spokesmen. An inspired 
      prophet could be identified using the two prescribed tests for prophets 
      in Deuteronomy. The context is that they are about to go into the Promised 
      Land and Moses will not be with them. They are not to appeal to diviners, 
      sorcerers, etc. (Deut. 18:9-12) for direction. Rather, vs 15,18 imply that 
      God would raise up a succession of prophets through which he would speak 
      to Israel (Jer. 7:25). He did this for about 1000 years, from Moses (1400 
      BC) to Malachi (400 BC). </p>
    <p>How would they know who God's spokesmen would be?</p>
    <p>Test #1 for Prophetic Authorship</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Accurate short-range predictions.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2">Deut.&nbsp;18:18-22 &quot;'I will raise up a prophet 
          from among their countrymen like you, and I will put My words in his 
          mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him. And it shall 
          come about that whoever will not listen to My words which he shall speak 
          in My name, I Myself will require it of him. But the prophet who shall 
          speak a word presumptuously in My name which I have not commanded him 
          to speak, or which he shall speak in the name of other gods, that prophet 
          shall die.' &quot;And you may say in your heart, 'How shall we know 
          the word which the LORD has not spoken?' &quot;When a prophet speaks 
          in the name of the LORD, if the thing does not come about or come true, 
          that is the thing which the LORD has not spoken. The prophet has spoken 
          it presumptuously; you shall not be afraid of him.&quot;</font> </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Deuteronomy 18:15-22 requires that prophets validate their claims by 
        giving short-range, detailed predictions (implied in v. 22). The penalty 
        for any inaccuracy in these predictions was death. Many subsequent passages 
        show that the Israelites applied this test (1 Samuel 3:19,20; Ezek. 33:33;

          that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he has counseled 
          rebellion against the LORD your God who brought you from the land of 
          Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery, to seduce you from

        the Israelites culpable for following false prophets and their gods (see

<ol>

    <ol>
      <li>Moses wrote the Pentateuch (Exodus 17:14; 24:4-7; 34:27; Deuteronomy 
        31:9,22,24; Ezra 7:6; Psalm 103:7; Joshua 8:31, 23:6; 1 Kings 2:3). </li>
      <li>The Major Prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel), except for Daniel, identify 
        themselves as prophets. They stated that they were ordered to write (Jeremiah 
        30:2; Ezekiel 43:11; Isaiah 8:1) because they were aware that they were 
        communicating revelation. This would account for the books by their names 
        plus Lamentations (by Jeremiah).</li>
      <li>All of the 12 Minor Prophets identify themselves as prophets. </li>
      <li>1st and 2nd Samuel, and 1st and 2nd Kings were written by prophets (1 
        Chronicles 29:29; 2 Chronicles 9:29; 12:15; 13:22; 20:34; 32:32; 33:19). 
      </li>
      <li>Joshua (Joshua&nbsp;1:1; 5:13-15), Solomon (1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;3:5ff.), 
        and Daniel (Daniel&nbsp;7:1) all received revelation from God, either 
        directly or through dreams and visions, which squares with God's description 
        of a prophet (Deuteronomy&nbsp;13:1; Numbers&nbsp;12:6-8). Joshua was 
        the first fulfillment of Deut. 18:15&#151;God&#146;s promise to raise up another 
        prophet after Moses. This accounts for Joshua, Daniel, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, 
        and Song of Solomon.</li>
      <li>David and Asaph, the two main authors of the Psalms, are identified 
        as prophets in Nehemiah 12:24,36 (&quot;David the man of God&quot;) and 
        2 Chronicles 29:30 (&quot;Asaph the seer&quot;).&nbsp; </li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Therefore, only Judges, Ruth, Chronicles, Job, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther 
        lack internal evidence for prophetic authorship. This represents less 
        than one-sixth of the Old Testament. <i>But since Israel used prophetic 
        authorship as the determining principle of their canon, we are safe in 
        assuming Israel included these books because they ascertained their prophetic 
        authorship.</i> (See &quot;EXTRA-BIBLICAL EVIDENCE&quot; for more on this.)</p>
      <p>NOTE: Contrary to the &quot;antiquity theory,&quot; </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The prophets' writings were accepted immediately as scripture. <br>
          Joshua received Moses' writing as scripture (Joshua 1:7,8; 8:32). Isaiah 
          and Micah accepted each other's writings as scripture contemporaneously 
          (Isaiah 2:2-4; Micah 4:1-4).<b> Daniel accepted the book of Jeremiah 
          as scripture (Daniel 9:2-Jer. 25:11)</b>. Jeremiah wrote 627-585 B.C. 
          and Daniel was around 537 B.C. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Other ancient writings were not accepted as canon. <br>
          The OT authors were aware of other ancient writings such as the Book 
          of Jasher (2 Samuel 1:18, Joshua 10:13) and the Book of the Wars of 
          the Lord (Num. 21:14).&nbsp; These books were important old documents.</li>
        <li>&quot;The book of Daniel, which critics have said was written as late 
          as 165 BC was received as authoritative by 110 BC, but a book like Ecclesiasticus, 
          similar in subject matter and also written in Hebrew, and dated about 
          180 BC was not accepted into the Hebrew canon.&quot; (Harris, <i>Inspiration

  <h3>EXTRA-BIBLICAL EVIDENCE FOR PROPHETIC AUTHORSHIP OF OLD TESTAMENT BOOKS 
  </h3>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS): Discovered in 1947, the DSS contained writings 
      dated largely from the first and second centuries BC. They contain entire 
      scrolls or portions of virtually every Old Testament book, except the book 
      of Esther (R. Laird Harris, <i>Inspiration and Canonicity of the Bible</i> 
      Grand Rapids: Zondervan Publishing, 1969, p.&nbsp;139). They also contain 
      writings that reflect this Jewish community's view of the Old Testament. 
      It is clear that the DSS community recognized the same Old Testament canon 
      we recognize. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Manual of Discipline and Zadokite Fragments quote from Isaiah, Deuteronomy, 
        Numbers, Leviticus, and Proverbs with the formula &quot;It is written.&quot; 
        Zadokite uses the formula &quot;God said&quot; for Isaiah, Malachi, Amos, 
        Zechariah, Hosea, Deuteronomy, Numbers and Micah. The Commentary on Habakkuk 
        indicates that Habakkuk was considered to be inspired.</li>
      <li>The apocryphal books (more on this later) are quoted also, but never 
        with one of the above formulae (more on the Apocrypha below). </li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>Conclusion</i>: Long before the Council of Jamnia in 90 AD, the Dead 
      Sea Scrolls quoted from all three divisions as scripture and refer to all 
      three as &quot;the Law and the Prophets&quot; or &quot;Moses and the Prophets.&quot; 
      The fact that they referred to all of the non-Penteteuchal books as &quot;the 
      prophets&quot; is additional evidence that they had ascertained prophetic 
      authorship of these books.</p>
    <p>Josephus: Josephus, a Jewish historian, wrote twenty years before Jamnia 
      and over 300 years before the Talmud's Tractate <i>Baba Bathra </i>which 
      is used to support the liberal three-stage development theory. Josephus 
      also had the actual Temple scrolls in his possession as a gift from the 
      Roman general Titus. Josephus should therefore be considered more authoritative 
      than the Talmud regarding the first century view of the canon. Josephus' 
      Old Testament was identical to our own. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>He says there were 22 books in the canon of the Old Testament (5 books 
        of Moses, 13 Prophets, and 4 Writings). This corresponds to our 39 books. 
        He recognized Jeremiah and Lamentations as one book, as he also did Judges 
        and Ruth, 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel, 1 Kings and 2 Kings, 1 Chronicles and 
        2 Chronicles, and Ezra and Nehimiah. The 12 Minor Prophets were also recognized 
        as one book, called &quot;The Book of the Twelve.&quot; </li>
    </ul>
    <p><small>For we have not an innumerable multitude of books among us, disagreeing 
      from and contradicting one another (as the Greeks have), but only twenty-two 
      books, which contain the records of all the past times; which are justly 
      believed to be divine; and of them, five belong to Moses, which contain 
      his laws, and the traditions of the origin of mankind until his death. This 
      interval of time is little short of three thousand years; but as to the 
      time from the death of Moses till the reign of Artexerxes king of Persia, 
      who reigned after Xerxes, the prophets, who were after Moses, wrote down 
      what was done in their times in thirteen books. The remaining four books 
      contain hymns to God, and precepts for the conduct of human life. From Artexerxes 
      to our own time the complete history has been written but has not been deemed 
      worthy of equal credit with the earlier records because of the failure of 
      the exact succession of the prophets.&quot; (Flavius Josephus, <i>Against 
      Apion</i> 1:8)</small> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The point: At 70 A.D. the Jews had the same OT as we do today.</li>
      <li><a name="a3">Josephus also indicates that there was an unbroken succession 
        of prophets from Moses to Malachi, and that the histories written since 
        Malachi were not inspired, because there had been no succession of prophets 
        since the time of Malachi. </a></li>
    </ul>

<h2>The Apocrypha</h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The Apocrypha is a collection of writings included in the Roman Catholic 
    Bible which were composed by Jewish authors in the intertestamental period 
    (200 BC to 50 BC). It contains both historical works and wisdom literature. 
    The Roman Catholic Bible contains the apocryphal books (Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, 
    Ecclesiasticus, Baruch I &amp; II, Maccabbees I &amp; II) and certain additions 
    to Esther and Daniel. Since these works are the primary source documents for 
    this period of Jewish history, they are very important from a historical standpoint. 
    These books should not be included in the canon for these reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>they were not written by prophets, </li>
    <li>they were universally rejected as scripture in their own day, </li>
    <li>they never make the claim to be scripture,</li>
    <li>and subsequently were rejected by both Jews and Christians,</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
<h3>JEWISH EVIDENCE THAT APOCRYPHAL BOOKS ARE NOT CANON</h3>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>The apocryphal books themselves admit that the prophetic succession ended 
        with Zechariah and Malachi. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><small>And they laid up the stones in the mountain of the temple in 
          a convenient place, <i>till there should come a prophet</i>, and give 
          answer concerning them. (1 Maccabees 4:46)</small></p>
        <p><small>And there was a great tribulation in Israel, such as was not 
          since the day, that <i>there was no prophet seen in Israel</i>. (1 Maccabees 
          9:27)</small></p>
        <p><small>And that the Jews, and their priests, had consented that he 
          should be their prince, and high priest for ever, <i>till there should 
          arise a faithful prophet</i>. (1 Maccabees 14:41) </small></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Josephus rejected the canonicity of the apocryphal books, apparently 
        reflecting current Jewish thought. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><small>From Artexerxes to our own time the complete history has been 
          written but has not been deemed worthy of equal credit with the earlier 
          records <i>because of the failure of the exact succession of the prophets</i>. 
          (Flavius Josephus, <i>Against Apion</i> 1:8) </small></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This view is also reflected in the Manual of Discipline in the Dead Sea 
        Scrolls. </p>
      <p>The Council of Jamnia held the same view. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>They debated the canonicity of a few books (e.g., Ecclesiastes), but 
          they changed nothing and never proclaimed themselves to be authoritative 
          determiners of the Old Testament canon. <small>&quot;The books which 
          they decided to acknowledge as canonical were already generally accepted, 
          although questions had been raised about them. Those which they refused 
          to admit had never been included. They did not expel from the canon 
          any book which had previously been admitted. 'The Council of Jamnia 
          was the confirming of public opinion, not the forming of it.'&quot;

      <li>How then did it find its way into the Bible?&nbsp; It was sometimes 
        included at the end of a New Testament codex copy. Since the codex was 
        cut and assembled before copying began, pages were left over. These were 
        often filled with one or more apocryphal books. </li>

        <p>Jerome vigorously resisted including the Apocrypha in his Latin Vulgate 
          Version (400 AD), but was overruled. As a result, the standard Roman 
          Catholic Bible throughout the medieval period contained it. Thus, it 
          gradually came to be revered by the average clergyman. Still, many medieval 
          Catholic scholars realized that it was not inspired. </p>

      <li>When and why did the Roman Catholic church canonize the Apocrypha? The 
        Roman Catholic Church did not officially canonize the Apocrypha until 
        the Council of Trent (1546). This was in part because the Apocrypha contained 
        material which supported certain Catholic doctrines, such as purgatory, 
        praying for the dead, and the treasury of merit. </li>

          who had discovered the things that were hidden. And so betaking themselves 
          to prayers, they besought him, that the sin which had been committed 
          might be forgotten. But the most valiant Judas exhorted the people to 
          keep themselves from sin, forasmuch as they saw before their eyes what 
          had happened, because of the sins of those that were slain. And making 
          a gathering, <i>he sent twelve thousand drachmas of silver to Jerusalem

          and vain to pray for the dead,) And because he considered that they 
          who had fallen asleep with godliness, had great grace laid up for them. 
          It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that

        Mark was.&quot; (Tertullian, <i>Against Marcion</i>, IV, 5, cited in <i>The 
        Ante-Nicene Fathers</i>, edited by Robertson and Donaldson, vol. 3, p. 
        350.)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <li>Luke functioned as Paul's amenuensis. 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><strong>Irenaeus</strong> said of the gospel of Luke: &quot; . . . 
          Luke, the follower of Paul, the gospel being preached by that one (Paul) 
          he put down in a book.&quot; (Penguin Classics: Eusebius, <i>The History 
          of the Church</i>, pp.&nbsp;210,211.)</p>
        <p>It is clear that Luke and Acts have the same author (refer to Luke 
          &amp; Acts introductory comments; read Donald Guthrie, New Testament 
          Introduction).</p>
        <p><strong>Origen</strong> says that Luke, &quot;composed for Gentile 
          converts&#133;the Gospel commended by Paul.&quot; (Origen, <i>Commentary 
          on Matthew</i>, preserved in <i>Eusebius Ecclesiastical History</i>, 
          vi. 25.6. Cf. <i>Zint</i>, vol. 2, p. 385).</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><strong>Tertullian </strong>called it &quot;Paul's gospel written by 
        Luke.&quot; (Tertullian, <i>Against Marcion</i>, iv. 5, in <i>Ante-Nicene 
        Fathers</i>, vol. 3, p. 350) </p>
    </blockquote>
    <li>Hebrews is of uncertain authorship, although it is theologically and conceptually 
      connected with Paul. At the same time, the grammar and vocabulary are quite 
      different from Paul's other books. Two options are possible: </li>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Clement of Rome (quoted by Eusebius) said that &quot;the epistle to the 
        Hebrews is Paul's,&quot; originally written in the Hebrew dialect but 
        later translated by Luke into Greek for use among Greek Christians. This 
        would account for the obvious difference in vocabulary and style between 
        Hebrews and Paul's letters. </p>
      <p>One of Paul's companions may have written it under his supervision, possibly 
        Timothy (see Hebrews 13:23). This would explain the difference in style 
        and vocabulary, as well as the author's third-person reference to the 
        apostles in Hebrews 2:3,4. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <li>Two explanations are possible with James and Jude. 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>The books may have been written by Christ's half-brothers (Matt.13:55; 
          Mark 6:3) who were closely associated with the Apostles (Acts 1:14). 
          James was designated as an apostle after the resurrection (1 Corinthians 
          15:7; Galatians 1:19). Early church sources indicate that James and 
          Jude, the half-brothers of Jesus, are the authors of these books. </p>
        <p>They may have been written by James and Jude the Alpheus brothers, 
          two of Jesus' original disciples (Luke 6:16; Acts 1:13). This possibility 
          comes about from a comparison of the crucifixion accounts, which seem 
          to establish that James the Less (James Alpheus) and Jesus were first 
          cousins on their mothers' side. Therefore, James the Less might have 
          called himself &quot;the Lord's brother&quot; (Galatians 1:19) within 
          the common usage of the day. </p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Conclusion: Therefore, the church did not create or determine the New Testament 
    canon. Church leaders and councils debated apostolic authorship of select 
    New Testament books. After they determined apostolic authorship, they recognized 
    the books as inspired. </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><small>&quot;We need speak of no strong intuition of the early church, 
      as does Westcott, whereby these holy writings were distinguished from others. 
      It was not an intuition: It was simple obedience to the known commands of 
      Christ and his apostles.&quot; (R. Laird Harris, <i>Inspiration and Canonicity</i>, 
      p.&nbsp;234) </small></p>
    <p><small>&quot;By thirty years after the death of John virtually all of them 
      were known and used in all the centers from which our evidence comes. Certain 
      of the smaller books were still, in some quarters, questioned as to their 
      authorship, and therefore as to their authority, for perhaps another fifty 
      years.&quot; (Ibid. p.246.) </small></p>
    <p><small>&quot;What is particularly important to notice is that the New Testament 
      canon was not demarcated by the arbitrary decree of any church council. 
      When at last a church council-the Synod of Hippo in AD 393-listed the 27 
      books of the New Testament, it did not confer upon them any authority which 
      they did not already possess, but simply recorded their previously established 
      canonicity.&quot; (F. F. Bruce, <i>The Books and the Parchments</i>, pp.&nbsp;112,113)

<h2><a name="a5">New Testament Pseudepigraphal Writings </a></h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p>New Testament pseudepigraphal writings refer to a large body of literature 
    written from the second century AD into the middle ages. &quot;Pseudepigraphal&quot; 
    means &quot;false writings&quot;-works that are forgeries, claiming apostolic 
    authorship so they will be viewed as authoritative. In general, these writings 
    fall into two categories: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Cheap devotional literature focusing on the miraculous and bizarre, written 
      to satisfy the desire for further information about the life of Jesus and 
      the careers of the apostles, 
      <p>EXAMPLE:&nbsp; The <em>Infancy Gospel of Thomas </em>dates from the middle 
        of the third century. It records various alleged incidents in Jesus' early 
        childhood. For example, Jesus molds clay pigeons on the Sabbath. When 
        people object to this, he claps his hands and the pigeons fly away. When 
        another child disperses a pool of water Jesus made, Jesus calls him an 
        insolent, godless dunderhead and paralyzes him. When another child bumps 
        into his shoulder, Jesus becomes exasperated and kills the child by cursing 
        him. When his parents complain about this to Joseph, Jesus smites them 
        blind. </p>
    </li>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>This account clearly portrays Jesus as an amoral (or immoral) miracle-worker. 
        Furthermore, the canonical gospels indicate that Jesus did not perform 
        miracles until the wedding at Cana (John 2:11). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <li>Attempts to propagate different and heretical teachings (e.g. Gnostic).</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Pseudepigraphal literature was written by heretics in an effort to foist 
      their ideas on the church with the alleged endorsement of Jesus or the apostles 
      (which shows that the false teachers had the same criteria of authority: 
      apostolic authority). Some of these writings are historically valuable because 
      they provide information about the post-apostolic church and the doctrinal 
      aberrations it faced. But they are not apostolic and therefore should not 
      be regarded as canonical. </p>
    <p>The Gospel of Thomas is the best known writing of this sort. Recently, 
      it has been used by New Age advocates to claim Jesus' support of their views 
      of spirituality. It was written in the early second century, and was discovered 
      in 1945 among the literature excavated at Nag Hammadi. The Gospel of Thomas 
      is a collection of 114 alleged sayings of Jesus, many of which are similar 
      to canonical sayings, but many of which (like the following) clearly contradict 
      the canonical gospels. </p>
    <ul>
      <li><small>&quot;These are the secret sayings which the living Jesus spoke 
        and which Didymus Judas Thomas wrote down. And he (Thomas) said, `Whoever 
        finds the interpretation of these sayings will not experience death.'&quot; 
        (1) </small> </li>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Notice the Gnostic view of salvation which comes through learning secret 
          knowledge. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <li><small>&quot;Jesus said, ` . . . the Kingdom is inside of you, and it 
        is outside of you. When you come to know yourselves, then you will become 
        known, and you will realize that it is you who are sons of the living 
        Father. But if you will not know yourselves, you will dwell in poverty 
        and it is you who are that poverty.'&quot; (3) </small> </li>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Salvation is not receiving God's forgiveness through Christ; it is 
          coming to realize that we are already sons of God. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <li><small>&quot;Jesus said, `Blessed is the lion which becomes man when 
        consumed by man; and cursed is the man whom the lion consumes, and the 
        lion becomes man.'&quot; (7)</small></li>
      <li><small>&quot;The disciples said, `We know that you will depart from 
        us. Who is to be our leader?' Jesus said to them, `Wherever you are, you 
        are to go to James the righteous, for whose sake heaven and earth came 
        into being.'&quot; (12)</small> </li>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Heaven and earth weren't made for James the righteous! </p>
      </blockquote>
      <li><small>&quot;Jesus said to his disciples, `Compare me to someone and 
        tell me whom I am like.' Simon Peter said to Him, `You are like a righteous 
        angel.' Matthew said to Him, `You are like a wise philosopher.' Thomas 
        said to Him, `Master, my mouth is totally incapable of saying what you 
        are like.' Jesus said, `I am not your master. Because you have drunk, 
        you have become intoxicated from the bubbling spring which I have measured 
        out.'&quot; (13) </small> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Jesus is saying Thomas has become so impressed by his teaching that 
            Thomas has wrongly ascribed to Jesus an authoritative role. Jesus 
            claimed to be the Messiah, the Lord, etc. and when Thomas worshipped 
            him as &quot;my Lord and my God&quot; (John 20:28), Jesus accepted 
            this worship. </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li><small>&quot;Mary said to Jesus, `Whom are your disciples like?' He 
        said, `They are like children who have settled in a field which is not 
        theirs. When the owners of the field come, they will say, &quot;Let us 
        have back our field.&quot; They will undress in their presence in order 
        to let them have back their field and to give it back to them . . . '&quot; 
        (21)&nbsp; </small></li>
      <li><small>&quot;His disciples said to Him, 'When will the repose of the 
        dead come about, and when will the new world come?' He said to them, 'what 
        you look forward to has already come, but you did not recognize it'&quot; 
        (51)</small> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p>In Matthew 19:28, Jesus clearly speaks of the millennial kingdom 
            as a future event, and of the disciples' roles in that future kingdom. 
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li><small>&quot;Simon Peter said to them, `Let Mary leave us, for women 
        are not worthy of Life.' Jesus said, `I myself shall lead her in order 
        to make her male, so that she too may become a living spirit resembling 
        you males. For every woman who will make herself male will enter the Kingdom 
        of Heaven.&quot; (114) </small> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p>I wonder why New Age advocates of this book don't quote this saying!

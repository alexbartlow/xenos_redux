<h3><strong><font face="Arial" size="3">Introduction</font></strong></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">C. S. Lewis spoke of the two most common 
    errors people tend to make about Satan: &quot;There are two equal and opposite 
    errors into which our race can fall about the devils. One is to disbelieve 
    in their existence. The other is to believe, and to feel an excessive and 
    unhealthy interest in them. They themselves are equally pleased by both errors, 
    and hail a materialist or a magician with the same delight.&quot; </font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Following the naturalism of the nineteenth 
    and twentieth centuries, liberal and neo-orthodox Christianity rejected Satan's 
    literal existence as primitive superstition. They reinterpreted the biblical 
    accounts of demon-possession in accordance with then-current psychological 
    theories. While evangelicals never went this far because of their high view 
    of scripture, they were sometimes guilty of mere mental assent without maintaining 
    an effective theology of spiritual warfare. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Pentecostals and charismatics, on the 
    other hand, have always emphasized the importance of spiritual warfare. They, 
    however, have often fallen into the opposite error against which Lewis warned. 
    Deeds of the flesh become demons to be exorcised. For example, on the topic 
    of sanctification, some Christian authors emphasize freedom from demonic influence 
    rather than ongoing choices to walk in the Spirit. For some, fear of Satan's 
    plots and powers overshadows Christ's victory over him (e.g. satanic ritual 
    abuse), and superstitious remedies become more popular than solid biblical 
    response (e.g., spiritual mapping; exorcism rituals). Over the last twenty 
    years, our culture has also become much more open to occultic spirituality, 
    so this error is now at least as prevalent as the first one. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This is the first of three lessons 
    on Satanology: the biblical study of Satan, demons and spiritual warfare. 
    Tonight we will consider the &quot;career&quot; of Satan (origin, fall, and 
    destiny) and his overt tactics. The next two weeks will be devoted to his 
    covert tactics.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<h3><strong><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name="a1">Scripture and Satan's Existence</a></font></strong></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The biblical testimony for the literal 
    existence of Satan and demons is extensive. The biblical worldview is seriously 
    incomplete without this material. We stand to suffer greatly if we do not 
    understand the reality of Satan and his efforts to attack us (I Peter 5:8,9; 
    Eph. 6:12).&nbsp; It is very dangerous to be in the midst of a war and not 
    realize it.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>The Old Testament</strong><b>:</b> 
    Mentions Satan and demons less frequently than the New Testament, but its 
    testimony is clear and consistent. See Gen.&nbsp;3:1 (see also Rev.&nbsp;12:9 
    &quot;the serpent of old&quot;); Lev.&nbsp;17:7; Deut.&nbsp;32:17; Ps.&nbsp;106:37; 
    1&nbsp;Chron.&nbsp;21:1; Job&nbsp;1,2; Zech.&nbsp;3:1,2 (Vision of Joshua 
    being accused by Satan)..</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">(<strong>Gen. 3:1</strong>) Now the serpent was
    more crafty than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the
    woman, &quot;Indeed, has God said, 'You shall not eat from any tree of the garden'?&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">(<strong>Lev. 17:7</strong>) &quot;And they shall
    no longer sacrifice their sacrifices to the goat demons with which they play the harlot.
    This shall be a permanent statute to them throughout their generations.&quot;' </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">(<strong>Deu. 32:17</strong>) &quot;They
    sacrificed to demons who were not God, To gods whom they have not known, New gods who came
    lately, Whom your fathers did not dread.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">(Zech. 3:1-2) 
      </font></b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Then he showed me

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><strong>(Eph. 6:12) </strong>For 
      our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against 
      the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual 
      forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name="a1">The Bible emphasizes </a>three 
    key attitudes in the area of spiritual warfare: </font></strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1) Alertness: </font></strong></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><strong>(1 Pet. 5:8*) </strong>Be 
        of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls about 
        like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Be a supernaturalist. Assume Satan 
        is at work: anticipate where he is working; pray for discernment; check 
        with fellow-workers, etc. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2) Militance: </font></strong></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><strong>(Rev 12:11*) </strong>And 
        they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the 
        word of their testimony, and they did not love their life even to death. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Satan loves to intimidate us so 
        that we flee from our spiritual responsibilities. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Satan would agree with Sun Tzu 
        who wrote the Art of War: &quot;Supreme excellence consists in breaking 
        the enemy's resistance without fighting.&quot; (as quoted in Bevin Alexander's, 
        &quot;How Great Generals Win&quot;, p. 31). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">That's what he wants to do to us. 
        We must determine to endure suffering and keep going no matter what the 
        cost is. This is key to spiritual warfare.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3) Confidence: </font></strong></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><strong>(1 John 4:4*)</strong> 
        You are from God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater 
        is He who is in you than he who is in the world. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><strong>(Eph. 6:10-18**)</strong>&nbsp; 
        Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of His might. (11) 
        Put on the full armor of God, that you may be able to stand firm against 
        the schemes of the devil. (12) For our struggle is not against flesh and 
        blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces 
        of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly 
        places. (13) Therefore, take up the full armor of God, that you may be 
        able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. 
        (14) Stand firm therefore, HAVING GIRDED YOUR LOINS WITH TRUTH, and HAVING 
        PUT ON THE BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, (15) and having shod YOUR FEET 
        WITH THE PREPARATION OF THE GOSPEL OF PEACE; (16) in addition to all, 
        taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish 
        all the flaming missiles of the evil one. (17) And take THE HELMET OF 
        SALVATION, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. (18) 
        With all prayer and petition pray at all times in the Spirit, and with 
        this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all 
        the saints&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Stand on the authority of God's 
        Word and Christ's victory over Satan. This prevents us from becoming paranoid 
        about Satan </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Question: Which of the above 
      attitudes do you tend to lack? </font></strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong><font face="Arial" size="3">Covert Tactics: </font></strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">While the gospels and Acts narrate 
      overt attack and deliverance, the epistles focus on covert tactics and response, 
      and we see people taken out of their walk more from these tactics than overt. 
      We should not conclude from this that overt attack no longer happens, but 
      that covert attack is more normal and should be our area of focus. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><strong>(2 Cor. 2:11) </strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;in 
          order that no advantage be taken of us by Satan; for we are not ignorant

    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In saying this to the Corinthians, 
        <strong>Paul implies that he had instructed the Corinthian believers in 
        Satan's covert tactics</strong> (e.g., division). Can you say &quot;I 
        am not ignorant of schemes?&quot; Can you help younger Christians and 
        fellow workers in this area? </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Satan is a pragmatist! 
        He will keep going to your weak area(s) until you take it away from him!</strong> 
        For example, until you resist in the area of the <i>kosmos</i> (seduction), 
        you probably won't experience many of his other covert tactics. </font></li>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The goal of the next two weeks is 
      to familiarize you with the main covert tactics discussed in the Bible.

      moral discipline may also make us vulnerable to doubt. </font></p>

      </i>You're not the first one to ever have this kind of doubt! One of the 
      main values of apologetics is to strengthen Christians against doubt. Many 
      suffer needlessly from doubt because they are too lazy to do this work. 
      <br>
      We run the risk of suppressing our own doubts with self-soothing behavior.</font></p>

      Learn to doubt your doubts! Satan will accuse God to us (e.g., that he will 
      abandon you), and unless we respond aggressively by rejecting such thoughts 
      on the basis of scripture, they will tend to grow into serious doubts. </font></p>

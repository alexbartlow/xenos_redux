<h3><strong><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name="a0"></a>Introduction</font></strong></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> In order to get the most out of what 
    God wants to teach you and I through the material of this and next week, we 
    should engage in an exercise of sorts with the Lord. In fact, regardless of 
    what material we study -- in a class, personal time with the Lord, at a teaching, 
    or wherever -- we will get NOTHING out of it if are not able to see ourselves 
    as God does. So tonight let's prepare our own spiritual soil for the Lord 
    to plant seeds by first reminding ourself of the need to be self-aware and 
    secondly to consider what do we expect and pursue from God.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1) Self-Awareness</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Too many Christians do not take 
        the time to examine themselves. They examine the situation or circumstances 
        they are in but not their character and motives that underly and actually 
        drive their actions, words, attitudes, and thought-life. Do we take the 
        time to look deeper at ourselves? EG. - When we taught on &quot;appropriating 
        our new identity&quot; in week 3, if you found it difficult to understand 
        the <i>necessity of</i> or <i>how to </i>examine your self on the level 
        of false beliefs about your identity, then you probably need to develop 
        more in this area.</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Socrates says, &quot;An unexamined 
          life is not worth living.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We should resolve to want to 
          see ourselves as God does. That under grace we want him to reveal things 
          about us that we know under grace he will grow us through. David has 
          the courage to pray in Ps. 139:23,24 (read) - we should as well. </font></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">2) What do we expect 
      from our relationship with God? And similarly, What do we pursue in our 
      relationship with God?</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Do we primarily follow God because we expect and pursue the benefits 
        to ourselves? Or to bear fruit which brings glory to God?</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>If we PRIMARILY expect &quot;the blessed life&quot; we might dabble 
          in God's purposes (ministry), or even do a fair amount...for a while. 
          But when the benefits don't come our way, we fold (EG. don't feel a 
          real closeness with God, don't bear fruit in leading people to Christ 
          or discipleship, tough circumstances in life continue, financial setbacks 
          still happen, relationships are still difficult to maintain). </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Our expectations have been dashed upon the rocks. Do we secretly, 
            down deep primarily pursue God because of what we believe is in it 
            for us?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>If we PRIMARILY are driven by a desire to bear fruit in God's purposes 
          then we understand that the personal benefits (growing experience of 
          depth with God, diminishing anxieties in areas of bad circumstances, 
          experience of fulfillment, etc.) will occur but what really consumes 
          our thinking and prayer is a desire to bring him glory by being used 
          by him in the Great Commission -- reaching the lost and discipling Christians.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>One of the best ways to self-examine here is to ask &quot;what do I pursue?&quot; 
        Where are my energies spent? </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Also, what causes me the most distress? Lack of comfort, pleasure, 
          &amp; secure living, lack of close experience with God - or lack of 
          bearing fruit for the Lord?</p>
        <p>Consider Paul: Look at his description of his &quot;joy&quot; and note 
          what it is inevitably associated with (Phil. 1:3-5,7; 2:2,17-18). Note 
          his joy is always associated with the Gospel being furthered - fruit 
          being born.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Our &quot;expectations&quot; of how God works in the life of the Christian 
      has a direct bearing on our susceptibility to the topic of this and next 
      week. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong><a name="a1"></a>Definition of Restorationism:</strong> 
    A movement emphasizing the belief that God's miraculous working in the gospels,

        early 20th cent.): Many believe speaking in tongues is a necessary evidence 
        of personal salvation (Apostolic Church) and that physical healing can 
        always be appropriated by faith (healing in the atonement). They tend 
        to be concerned about doctrine, and are somewhat sectarian. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><em>Charismatic Movement </em>(started 
        mid 20th cent.): They believe a second act of grace of being &quot;Spirit-filled&quot; 
        or Spirit-baptized&quot; is necessary after conversion, and tongues are 
        evidence of this; more focused on experience than doctrine, so it spread 
        through Catholic and dead, ritualistic, liberal Protestant denominations 
        (Episcopalians). </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><em>&quot;Third Wave&quot; </em>(started

        goal is to bring the full power of the Spirit as they see him working 
        in the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles, into mainstream evangelical churches.&nbsp; 
        They don't hold to a second act of grace, tongues as evidence of salvation,

      expectation of God's supernatural involvement, and focus on evangelism and 
      missions. We disagree with some features of restorationism and find that 
      many in this camp have serious problems in their interpretation of scripture

  <h3><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><a name="b1" id="b1"></a>1. Miracles 
    are not normative in biblical history.</font></h3>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">How frequent are miracles in the 
      Bible?&nbsp; Christians commonly assume that people living in biblical times 
      experienced overt miracles as a normal state of affairs. But this is not 
      the case. When we look at the entire biblical record (which covers over 
      2200 years), we discover that there are a few periods of concentrated miraculous 
      activity. These periods usually correspond to crucial junctures in God's 
      redemptive plan (e.g., Abraham; the Exodus &amp; Conquest; Elijah &amp; 
      Elishah; Jesus &amp; the Apostles; the end of the age). </font></p>
    <p><img src="cpu2w91.jpg" alt="wpe1.jpg (13076 bytes)" width="820" height="275"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Old Testament psalmists frequently 
      look back on the Exodus as special because of the outpouring of miracles 
      (Psalm 105:27ff), and Old Testament prophets look forward to the coming 
      of Messiah as a period of special miraculous activity (see Isa.&nbsp;35,61). 
      This clearly implies that they were not experiencing a lot of miraculous 
      activity in their own days.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">&quot;The popular notion 
      that Bible abounds with miracles, so that they are present on practically 
      every page, is refuted by a simple reading of the Scriptures. As Sir Robert 
      Anderson showed in his volume The Silence of God, miracles have generally 
      occurred in periods, the great ones being the creation, the exodus, the 
      age of Elijah and Elisha, the time of Daniel, and the days of Christ and 
      the apostles. That we should be living in a period of the silence of God 
      (so far as miracle is concerned) should not trouble us unduly, seeing there 
      have been other times when this was true.&quot;</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

          were preceded or followed by teaching in which he explained his unique

              qualitatively greater miracles (how could you do something greater 
              than raising people from the dead?), but quantitatively greater. 
              Whereas Jesus was limited to one body and a three year ministry, 
              the body of Christ is composed of many people over a long period 
              of time. So, Jesus predicts that the church (by the power of the 
              Holy Spirit) will do even more miracles than Jesus did. &quot;Might 
              'greater' mean 'more numerous' or 'more widely dispersed?' In that 
              sense, Christians have indeed done 'greater' things than Jesus did. 
              We have preached all over the world, seen millions of men and women 
              converted, dispensed aid, education, and food to still more millions. 
              The 'greater' works may therefore be the gathering of converts into 
              the church through the witness of the disciples (cf. 17:20; 20:29), 
              and the overflow of kindness that stems from transformed lives.&quot;

    <p>Summary of the Acts accounts:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">(D. A. Carson) &quot;Acts provides 
        not a paradigm for individual Christian experience, but the account of 
        the gospel's outward movement, geographically, racially, and above all 
        theologically.&quot; (D.A. Carson, <em>Showing the Spirit</em>, p. 150.)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Luke was narrating a &quot;highlights 
        film&quot; of a unique period in church history led by unique spokesmen. 
        His purpose was to narrate the expansion of the gospel in fulfillment 
        of Acts 1:8. There is no evidence that Luke intended his record to serve 
        as a paradigm for all churches or individuals, because we do not see some 
        of the extraordinary events and practices described in Acts (e.g. Acts 
        19:11,12) reiterated in the epistles. However, the early church as described 
        in Acts does serve as a model for us in whatever areas <em>are also mandated 
        in the didactic portions </em>of the New Testament (e.g., evangelism and 
        missions; prayer; sacrificial giving; etc.). </font></p>

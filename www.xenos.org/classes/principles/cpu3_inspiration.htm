<h3>Introduction </h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>REVIEW definition of Verbal Plenary Inspiration: <i>God so moved the human 
    authors of scripture that the resulting product was the Word of God written, 
    totally without error in all that it affirms in the original autographs, in 
    every area including theology, history, geography and science.</i></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Remember the qualifications to this definition described toward the end 
      of last week's teaching.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>OBJECTION: What is problematic with these statements? (play the devil's advocate):</p>
  <ul>
    <li> 
      <p><i>&quot;The Bible is inspired because it/Jesus claims to be inspired.&quot; 
        </i>(2 Pet 1:20-21*; 2&nbsp;Tim. 3:16*) But this is circular reasoning-we 
        must assume the validity of the conclusion in order to reach the conclusion. 
        What evidence is there that we should trust the Bible's claims for itself?&nbsp; 
        And what about the Quran which also claims inspiration yet contradicts 
        the Bible's content?&nbsp; Why should we believe what Jesus says, and 
        what confidence can we have that the gospels record reliably what Jesus 
        said?</p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <p><i><em>&quot;I believe the Bible is inspired by God because its contents 
        resonate with me.&quot;&nbsp; </em></i>There is some truth to this statement.&nbsp; 
        Since the Bible is living and active (Heb. 4:12) and since the Spirit 
        convicts people of the truth (John 16:8) we can expect that people will 
        resonate with the Bible's content to some extent. &nbsp; But this is an 
        inadequate basis for belief in inspiration because it is too subjective.&nbsp; 
        People commonly report &quot;resonating&quot; with the Celestine Prophecy 
        and other books which clearly contradict the Bible.&nbsp; Furthermore 
        the offensive content in scripture leads to &quot;selective resonation.&quot;</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 align="center">EVIDENCE FOR INSPIRATION</h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The nature of investigation and evidence: Like all matters of historical 
    inquiry, we do not have a scientific, empirical, &quot;knock out&quot; proof 
    of verbal plenary inspiration. Imagine for example, a crime scene where various 
    evidence is gathered. We have <i>lines</i> of evidence that provide us with 
    <i>sufficient</i> evidence to put our trust in Christ, whose authority <i>then 
    </i> assures us of the verbal plenary inspiration of the scriptures. This 
    is an argument from authority (Christ's). We do this by studying, then concluding: 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>There is sufficient evidence that Jesus is the Messiah. </li>
    <li>Jesus viewed scripture as inspired by God.</li>
    <li>The Gospels accurately recorded what Jesus said.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Therefore our belief in inspiration is anchored in persuasive and abundant 
    evidence. </p>
  <p>WARNING: It takes time to master this material, but your investment will 
    yield rich dividends in terms of strengthening your own faith and helping 
    others! View your notes as a source of valuable information that you can review 
    for your own sake, and for use with non-Christians and newer Christians. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="a1"></a>1. There is sufficient evidence that Jesus is the Messiah: 
  <em>Fulfilled Prophecy </em></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>God uses fulfilled prophecy to validate scripture.</p>
    <p><b>ITS IMPORTANCE: </b>Of all so-called &quot;scriptures,&quot; the Bible 
      is the only one which anticipates our need for external validation of its 
      contents, and provides a unique means for this through fulfilled historical 
      prophecy.</p>
    <p>Other &quot;scriptures&quot; either do not even claim to be revelation 
      (e.g., Eastern religious &quot;scriptures&quot; claim only to be human speculation), 
      or provide no means of external verification for their claim (e.g., the 
      Qu'ran, the Book of Mormon, and the Writings Baha'u'llah claim inspiration, 
      but have historical inaccuracies and have only general predictions of the 
      end of the age &#151; not detailed historical predictions that have been 
      fulfilled &#151; see <a href="cpu4_evang_2.htm#a2">Unit Four</a> notes for 
      more information). </p>
    <p>See God's response to Israel's idolatry during Isaiah's day. &quot;I will 
      give you unique evidence that I am the only true God&#151;I will predict 
      the future.&quot; </p>
    <ul>
      <li> 
        <p>Isa. 41:21-29 &quot;Present your case,&quot; says the LORD. &quot;Set 
          forth your arguments,&quot; says Jacob's King. &quot;Bring in your idols 
          to tell us what is going to happen. <i>Tell us what the former things 
          were, so that we may consider them and know their final outcome. Or 
          declare to us the things to come, tell us what the future holds, so 
          we may know that you are gods. </i>Do something, whether good or bad, 
          so that we will be dismayed and filled with fear. But you are less than 
          nothing and your works are utterly worthless; he who chooses you is 
          detestable. &quot;I have stirred up one from the north, and he comes&#151;one

          say, 'He was right'?</i> No one told of this, no one foretold it, no 
          one heard any words from you. I was the first to tell Zion, 'Look, here 
          they are!' I gave to Jerusalem a messenger of good tidings. I look but 
          there is no one&#151; no one among them to give counsel, no one to give

          pass. <i>For I knew how stubborn you were; the sinews of your neck were 
          iron, your forehead was bronze. Therefore</i> I told you these things

          not say, 'My idols did them; my wooden image and metal god ordained

    <p>Biblical predictions were written down so they could be preserved and provide 
      verification for subsequent generations. We have sufficient historical evidence 
      to establish the fulfillment of many Biblical predictions.</p>
    <p><a name="a2">F</a>ULFILLED MESSIANIC PROPHECY: Although there are many 
      kinds of fulfilled biblical prophecies (e.g., the destruction of Tyre in 
      Ezek. 26 and the dispersion and regathering of Israel), fulfilled messianic 
      prophecies are especially important because they demonstrate that Jesus 
      is the Messiah and therefore his teaching about the Bible is authoritative. 
      The Old Testament contains over 300 prophecies that were fulfilled by Jesus. 
    </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Jesus and the apostles considered these prophecies to be sufficient evidence 
        for believing in his Messiahship.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Luke 24:44-46 He said to them, &quot;This is what I told you while 
          I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about 
          me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.&quot; Then he opened 
          their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. He told them, &quot;This 
          is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on 
          the third day . . . &quot; </p>
        <p>Acts 17:2-4 As his custom was, Paul went into the synagogue, and on 
          three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, explaining 
          and proving that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead. &quot;This 
          Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Christ, &quot; he said. Some of 
          the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number 
          of God-fearing Greeks and not a few prominent women. </p>
        <p>1 Cor. 15:3-4 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance 
          : that Christ died for our sins <i>according to the Scriptures</i>, 
          that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day <i>according 
          to the Scriptures</i> . . . </p>

          Note in Luke that the genealogy runs through Nathan and not Solomon. 
          Matt. 1:12 note Jeconiah who God curses in Jer. 22:30. The Matt. genealogy 
          is Joseph's and the Luke 3 genealogy is Mary's. This makes Jesus a blood 
          descendent of David through Mary, thus excluding Jeconiah fulfilling 
          the curse, but Jesus has legal rights to the throne since he is an &quot;adopted&quot;

    <p><strong>Daniel 9:24,25 </strong>(Time of death)</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>How long is a &quot;week?&quot; </i> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p>&quot;Shabua&quot; means &quot;seven&quot; (NIV). When Jews used 
            this term to refer to time, they used it as weeks of days or weeks 
            of years. One must examine the context to determine whether the meaning 
            is a &quot;seven&quot; of days or a &quot;seven&quot; of years. </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Illustration: we say &quot;dozen&quot; - but a dozen of what? Context 
              decides that usually.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>In several instances <i>shabua</i> refers to &quot;seven&quot; of 
            years.(Gen. 29:27-30)</p>
          <p>There are several reasons why this passage refers to weeks of years.&nbsp; 
          </p>
          <p>COMMON SENSE: 69 weeks of days would only be a little over one year. 
            This was nowhere near enough to rebuild the city. It took them over 
            46 years just to rebuild the Temple (Jn.&nbsp;2:20). <br>
            <br>
            FOLLOWING CONTEXT: In Dan. 10:2, Daniel says literally &quot;(I) had 
            been mourning three entire weeks of days.&quot; Why would Daniel go 
            out of his way to notify his audience of such an obvious thing, unless 
            he had been using &quot;week&quot; in a different way in chapter 9?<br>
            <br>
            HISTORICAL SETTING: Israel's 70 year exile (Dan.&nbsp;9:2) was God's 
            punishment for their neglect of the sabbath land rest (Lev. 25:1-7; 
            26:34,35,43). God removed them from their land one year for every 
            year they violated this law (2 Chron. 36:20,21)-490 years or 70 &quot;weeks&quot; 
            of years. Therefore as Daniel looks ahead to 70 future &quot;sevens&quot; 
            they would most likely be sevens of years and not days.</p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p>Lev. 25 1:-4 The LORD then spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai, saying,2 
              &quot;Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, `When you come 
              into the land which I shall give you, then the land shall have a 
              sabbath to the LORD. 3 `Six years you shall sow your field, and 
              six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its crop,4 
              but during the seventh year the land shall have a sabbath rest, 
              a sabbath to the LORD; you shall not sow your field nor prune your 
              vineyard.<br>
            </p>
            <p>2 Chron. 36:20,21- And those who had escaped from the sword he 
              carried away to Babylon; and they were servants to him and to his 
              sons until the rule of the kingdom of Persia, to fulfill the word 
              of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed 
              its sabbaths. All the days of its desolation it kept sabbath until 
              seventy years were complete.<br>

        <p>The Jews used a lunar year of twelve 30-day months, irregularly adding 
          a leap month to correct the calendar. So Daniel's audience would have 
          understood this to refer to 360-day years. Other passages referring 
          to the last &quot;week&quot; (Rev.&nbsp;11:2,3) confirm this 360-day

          was the one given in 444 BC by Artexerxes Langimanus (see Neh.&nbsp;2:1-8).

        <p>Converting from Daniel's 360-day lunar years to our present solar years 
          makes 69 &quot;weeks&quot; just over 476 years long. Crossing from BC 
          to AD requires that we move one year further because there is no &quot;zero&quot; 
          year. This brings us to 33&nbsp;AD, the very year that Jesus rode into 
          Jerusalem, was hailed as Messiah by the multitude of disciples (see 
          Luke&nbsp;19:35-44), and was crucified. No other Jewish Messiah claimant

        <p>NOTE: &quot;They pierced my hands and my feet&quot; (22:16) describes

          that Christians altered the text. The Jewish Bible (using the Masoretic 
          text) says &quot;like a lion, they are at my hands and my feet.&quot; 
          The Hebrew word for &quot;they pierced&quot; is <i>ka'arey</i>. The 
          word for &quot;like a lion&quot; is <i>ka'aru</i>. The only difference 
          is the length of the stem of the last letter. Did the Christians alter 
          the text to help their cause? Two reasons say this is not so. </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>First, the phrase &quot;like a lion, my hands and my feet&quot; makes

            and even if one assumes those words the image of a lion being at someone's 
            hands and feet makes no sense.</p>
          <p>Second, the Septuagint (LXX), authored by Jewish scholars in 250 
            BC, translates &quot;they pierced.&quot; This means their Hebrew text 
            was <i>ka'arey</i>. Therefore, <i>ka'aru</i> is a scribal error or

<h3>2. Jesus Viewed Scripture as Inspired</h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>This is an argument from authority. As Christians, our view of the Bible 
    rests on the authority of Christ. The Bible claims that Jesus is God incarnate. 
    Jesus claims that of himself (John 8:58; 10:30-33). If this is true, then 
    what he has to say about the Bible should carry the ultimate authority in 
    establishing our views about Scripture. <i>Does Christ view scripture as inspired 
    and authoritative?</i> </p>

      you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, 
      not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law 
      until everything is accomplished. </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Jesus says the Old Testament is eternally authoritative down to the very 
        <i>letters</i> used. </p>
      <p>In Matthew 22:22-32, Jesus draws attention to the tense of the verb &quot;to 
        be&quot; to prove the resurrection from the dead.</p>

    <p>John 10:35,36 &quot;If he called them 'gods,' to whom the word of God came&#151;and

      set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse 
      me of blasphemy because I said, 'I am God's Son'?&quot; </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Jesus is responding to the Jews' charge of blasphemy because he said 
        &quot;I and the Father are one.&quot; Citing Ps. 82:6, in which God called 
        people &quot;gods&quot; (<i>elohim</i>), Jesus argues (<i>a fortiori</i>) 
        that if it is appropriate for humans to be called &quot;gods,&quot; how 
        much more appropriate is it for him (as the Son of God) to refer to himself 
        as &quot;one with the Father.&quot; </p>
      <p>Notice that Jesus views the entire Old Testament, even seemingly incidental 
        statements, as incapable of error. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Mark 7:5-13 &quot;You have let go of the commands of God and are holding 
      on to the traditions of men . . . Thus you nullify the word of God by your 
      tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that.&quot; 
    </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Jesus viewed the Old Testament in a totally different category than religious 
        tradition. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> Jesus affirmed the historicity of Old Testament characters and events. 
      See also Matthew 12:38-40 [Jonah]; Matthew 19:4-5 [creation of Adam and 
      Eve]; Luke 17:26-32 [Noah]; Luke 20:37 [call of Moses]; John 3:14 [Moses/serpent 
      in wilderness]. </p>

      that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. 
      But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice 
      is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain came down, the

    <p>John 12:48 &quot;There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not 
      accept my words; that very word which I spoke will condemn him at the last 
      day.&quot; 
    <blockquote> 
      <p>In both of these passages, Jesus claims that people's eternal destiny 
        will be decided by how they respond to his words (see also Jn. 5:24).

    <p>John 8:31,32 To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, &quot;If you 
      hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the 
      truth, and the truth will set you free.&quot; 
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Notice that Jesus regards his teaching as &quot;the truth&quot; which 
        is capable of setting people free from sin. Old Testament passages like 
        Ps. 119 make similar claims for the word of God. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> NOTE: Old Testament prophets' &quot;Thus said the Lord&quot; is similar 
      to Jesus' &quot;Truly I say to you&quot;.&nbsp; This would have been heard 
      loud and clear by his audience as a statement of divine authority.</p>

      me receives the one who sent me . . . &quot; 
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Notice how similar this statement is to John 12:48 (see above). Jesus 
        is the Father's authoritative spokesman, so that to reject his words is 
        to reject the Father. So also the apostles (the original audience in this 
        passage) are his authoritative spokesmen, so that to reject their words 
        is to reject Jesus and the Father. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Jesus promised the apostles that the Holy Spirit would enable them to speak 
      for him. In other words, the Holy Spirit would inspire their words. 
    <blockquote> 
      <p>John 14:26 &quot;But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father 
        will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of 
        everything I have said to you.&quot; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Holy Spirit gave them supernatural recall of Jesus' words and the ability 
      to interpret Jesus' life and death. </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>John 15:26,27 &quot;When the Counselor comes, whom I will send to you 
        from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father, he 
        will testify about me. And you also must testify, for you have been with 
        me from the beginning.&quot; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Holy Spirit gave them the authority to &quot;bear witness&quot; (provide 
      legal testimony) concerning Jesus. </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>John 16:13 &quot;But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide 
        you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what 
        he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.&quot; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Holy Spirit would enable them to interpret Jesus' coming death and 
      resurrection, and to prophesy concerning the future (e.g., John in Revelation).

    <p>Who were the Apostles? Jesus' original twelve disciples, minus Judas, plus 
      Matthias (Acts 1:26), plus Paul (Gal. 1:1) and James the Lord's brother 
      (Gal.&nbsp;1:19), were given apostolic authority. </p>
    <p>The New Testament speaks of many others as being &quot;apostles&quot; in 
      a more generic sense, but it refers to this special class of &quot;Capital 
      A&quot; apostles as uniquely authoritative (generic: Phil. 2:25; 2 Cor. 
      8:23; probably Rom. 16:7 cf. 2 Cor. 12:12). (<a href="cpu2w9.htm">See Unit 
      #2 Week #9</a>) .</p>
    <p>{There was no apostolic succession, contrary to Roman Catholicism's doctrine 
      of papal authority. One had to have witnessed the resurrection to be an 
      Apostle (1&nbsp;Cor. 9:1), and Paul was the &quot;last of all&quot; to have 
      witnessed the resurrected Christ (1 Cor. 15:8).}</p>

        <p>1 Thess. 2:13 &quot;And we also thank God continually because, when

      <li>
        <p>1 Jn. 4:4-6 &quot;You (his Christian audience), dear children, are

          than the one who is in the world. They (the Gnostic heretics) are from 
          the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the 
          world listens to them. We (the apostles) are from God, and whoever knows 
          God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us.

<p>Let's review what has been established so far: </p>

  <p>BUT our claims for the Bible are coming from the Bible. With the exception 
    of several fulfilled prophecies (which secular historical sources can verify), 
    our arguments depend upon the Bible being a reliable historical document.<br>
    Therefore we must determine whether the Bible accurately records Christ's 
    words and actions. </p>
  <p>There are three tests to which <i>all</i> historical source documents are

        Testament) and the earliest extant evidence becomes so small as to be 
        in fact negligible, and the last foundation for any doubt that the Scriptures 
        have come down to us substantially as they were written has now been removed. 
        Both the authenticity and the general integrity of the books of the New 
        Testament may be regarded as finally established. </i>(Sir Frederick Kenyon,

  <p>OLD TESTAMENT</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Many have been skeptical about the Old Testament's historical reliability. 
      Scholars in past generations have rejected the extraordinary prophecies 
      concerning Christ in the Old Testament while contending that these prophecies 
      were inserted after the fact by Christians to prove their case. Why? Because 
      the earliest extant copies dated to about 900 A.D.&#151;fully 1,300 years 
      after the Old Testament was completed (400 B.C.). Certain discoveries have 
      demonstrated the accuracy of Old Testament transmission. </p>
    <p>The Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) were discovered in 1947. These texts were left 
      by the Qumran community, a Jewish sect. These copies have been reliably 
      dated to between 200 B.C. and A.D. 70. The copies include complete copies 
      of much of the Old Testament. This is important for 2 reasons: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> The copies of the Old Testament were virtually identical to the Old 
        Testament we read today! There is only a 5% variation between DSS and 
        the modern Old Testament. Where variation exists, it is in the area of 
        spelling and punctuation. There is therefore no substantial change in 
        the meaning of the text. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li> 
        <p>Specific prophecies about Jesus Christ were not written after the fact. 
          The Isaiah scroll (which includes Isa. 53) is dated to around 200. B.C. 
          Fragments of Daniel also date to the second century B.C.</p>

          <p>This is why F. F. Bruce (New Testament scholar) said: <i>The earliest 
            preachers of the gospel knew the value of . . . first-hand testimony, 
            and appealed to it time and again. 'We are witnesses of these things,' 
            was their constant and confident assertion. And it can have been by 
            no means so easy as some writers seem to think to invent words and 
            deeds of Jesus in those early years when so many of His disciples 
            were about who could remember what had and had not happened (and been 
            said).</i> </p>
          <p><i>And it was not only friendly eyewitnesses that the early preachers 
            had to reckon with; there were others less well disposed who were 
            also conversant with the main facts of the ministry and death of Jesus. 
            The disciples could not afford to risk inaccuracies (not to speak 
            of willful manipulation of the facts), which would at once be exposed 
            by those who would be only too glad to do so. On the contrary, one 
            of the strong points in the original apostolic preaching is the confident 
            appeal to the knowledge of the hearers; they not only said, 'We are 
            witness of these things,' but also, 'As you yourselves also know' 
            (Acts 2:22). Had there been any tendency to depart from the facts 
            in any material respect, the possible presence of hostile witnesses

        <p>The trustworthiness of a testimony is to a great extent dependent on 
          the consistency of the claims being made. When an account states a fact

        there is no way to do history. This is the problem with liberal scholarship

        <li>They are explained by using textual criticism as applied to errors 
          in transmission or translation. (E.G. 2 Kings 8:26 vs. 2 Chron. 22:2 
          [in KJV]; 2 Chron. 22 in KJV &#151; says Ahaziah was 42 when became 
          king, 2 Kings says 22.&nbsp; 2 Kings is correct since his father died 
          at age of 40.&nbsp; In some manuscripts, the proto-Hebrew [old Phoenician] 
          alphabet was used and the 42 and 22 were very similar. NASB &amp; NIV 
          have corrected this and have both at 22.)</li>
        <li>They are explained by a thorough inductive study of the passage which 
          shows how to harmonize the apparent contradiction. Luke 18:35 vs. Matthew&nbsp; 
          20:29; There were two Jerichos &#151; Roman &amp; Greek.&nbsp; Makes 
          sense that Luke, as a Greek, would be referring to the Greek one.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Gleason Archer has written the book, <i>Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties,</i> 
        to address this very issue. Dr. Archer is uniquely equipped for this job. 
        He has command of ancient languages and of the tools of biblical scholarship, 
        as well as years of personal study and teaching. With regard to the issue 
        of inconsistency, contradiction and error, he concludes: </p>
      <p><i>As I have dealt with one apparent discrepancy after another and have 
        studied the alleged contradictions between the biblical record and the 
        evidence of linguistics, archaeology, or science, my confidence in the 
        trustworthiness of Scripture has been repeatedly verified and strengthened 
        by the discovery that almost every problem in Scripture that has ever 
        been discovered by man, from ancient times until now, has been dealt with 
        in a completely satisfactory manner by the biblical text itself&#151;or 
        else by objective archaeological information.</i> (Archer, Gleason. <i>Encyclopedia 
        of Bible Difficulties.</i> Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1982, p. 12.) </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To get a look at some of the more common contradictions cited and cogent 
      explanations, see R.L. Harris, <i>Inspiration and Canonicity</i>, pp. 104-108.</p>
    <p>Because so many apparent contradictions have been resolved like this in 
      the past, we are justified in expressing confidence that presently unresolved 
      problems could be resolved similarly if and when enough data becomes available.

  <p><strong><a name="a8">Historical Reliability of ancient texts:</a> <em>External 
    Test</em></strong> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Are there sources outside of the Bible which can contradict or confirm 
      the witness of the accounts themselves? Even an eyewitness account loses 
      credibility if it can be proven to have factual inaccuracies from sources 
      outside (external) itself. </p>
    <p>When we look at other &quot;scriptures,&quot; we find they do not interface 
      with history at all, or they interface inaccurately.</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>The eastern &quot;scriptures&quot; have no interest in history, because 
        this is the world of illusion from which we are to be delivered. Ancient 
        polytheistic religions likewise had no interest in history. Their gods 
        acted only in myths, removed as far as possible from real history.</p>
      <p>The Koran is almost entirely assertions of Allah. It has very little 
        historical interface, and what there is contains clear inaccuracies.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><i>Sura 26:55-60</i> says that the Israelites under Pharaoh were but 
          &quot;a scanty band&quot; (in contrast to the multitude mentioned in 
          Ex.&nbsp;1:9) and that in leaving Egypt they forsook &quot;their gardens 
          and fountains and splendid dwellings&quot; (in contrast to their slavery 
          and hardship mentioned Ex. 1:11-14). This renders the whole motive for 
          Israel's deliverance obscure.</p>
        <p><i>Sura 5:119 </i>reflects Muhammad's gross misunderstanding of the 
          Trinity&#151;that it is composed of the Father, Jesus and Mary.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The Book of Mormon makes many historical references, but it too is full 
        of historical anachronisms and geographical inaccuracies.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>1 Nephi 2:5-8 states that the river Laman emptied into the Red Sea. 
          But there has never been any river that emptied into the Red Sea, either 
          in historic or prehistoric times.</p>
        <p>Alma 46:15 states that believers were called &quot;Christians&quot; 
          back in 73 BC&#151;fully seven decades before Jesus was even born!</p>

    <p><i>Early extra-biblical Records </i>- Most of what we know about Jesus 
      Christ is reported in the Bible. But there is also early extra-biblical 
      attestation to Jesus. </p>

        <p><i>Tacitus</i> (Roman historian) - During his comments on Nero's attempt 
          to blame Christians for the burning of Rome, he says &quot; . . . Nero 
          fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class 
          hated for the abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, 
          from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during 
          the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one or our procurators, Pontius 
          Pilatus . . .&quot; (Tacitus, <i>Annals</i> xv, 44. The Oxford Translation, 
          Revised [New York: Harper &amp; Bros., Publishers, 1858], p. 428).&nbsp;

      <li> <i>The Early Church Fathers</i>, who wrote from the end of the first 
        century through the second century, confirm the highest regard for the 
        apostles and the inspiration of the letters they had written. They viewed 
        them as &quot;Sacred Scriptures,&quot; &quot;Holy Word.&quot; Between 
        them, they quote and name all the books of the New Testament canon. </li>

      <li><i>Archaeology</i> has also resolved many apparent discrepancies, thus 
        demonstrating the Bible's historical and geographical accuracy. 
        <blockquote> 
          <p><em>With regard to the Old Testament</em>, higher critics have taught 
            that during the time of Moses and his alleged writings, humans did 
            not yet write. Such detailed legislation, they alleged, wasn't recorded 
            until the Persian period (about 538 B.C. or about 900 years after 
            Moses). They also claimed that many of the cities and people of the 
            Old Testament were fictitious. Many recent discoveries have refuted 
            their objections. </p>
          <p>In 1968, the statue of King Ibbit-Lim of Ebla Kingdom was discovered 
            in northern Syria (part of Moses' world). This kingdom's power flourished 
            between 2500-2200 B.C. Since 1974, 17,000 tablets have been unearthed. 
            These tablets contain detailed descriptions of laws, customs, and 
            historical events of that kingdom. </p>

            <p>They confirm the biblical description of the people, customs, and 
              laws of this time which modern scholars were trying to deny. </p>
            <p>Their economic records include references to biblical sites such 
              as Hazier, Gaze, Megiddo, and Jerusalem. Their commercial texts 
              mention the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.. </p>
            <p>They also mention Chedorloamer and the other city-kings mentioned 
              in Gen. 14&#151;who were long considered fictitious by higher critics. 
              They also describe the wealth and affluence of their society before 
              the calamity described in Gen. 14, which supports the biblical account.

            <p>Several discoveries including evidence for King David's existence 
              are summarized in a <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/home.htm">US

              in stone found in excavation at Dan in 1993.</p>
            <p>This is why the renowned Jewish archeologist Nelson Glueck says, 
              &quot;It may be stated categorically that no archeological discovery 
              has ever controverted a biblical passage. Scores of archeological 
              findings have been made which confirm in clear outline or exact 
              detail historical statements in the Bible.&quot;&nbsp; Nelson Glueck,

      <p><em>With regard to the New Testament,</em> there has been less critical 
        opposition. Higher critics rejected Acts, citing several presumed historical 
        inaccuracies until archeological evidence demonstrated its reliability.</p>
      <p>Sir William Ramsay, one of greatest archaeologists who ever lived, researched 
        much of Asia Minor in an effort to disprove Luke's history by demonstrating 
        inaccuracies. He entered his research with the assumption that &quot;Luke&quot; 
        had written almost 100 years later than he claimed, inferring that it 
        wasn't written by an eyewitness at all. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>After 30 years of archaeological research, Ramsay concluded: <i>Luke's 
          historicity is unsurpassed in respect to its trustworthiness . . . Luke 
          is a historian of the first rank; not merely are his statements of fact 
          trustworthy . . . this author should be placed along with the very greatest 
          of historians.</i> (Ramsay, W. <i>The Bearing of Recent Discovery on 
          the Trustworthiness of the New Testament. </i>Grand Rapids: Baker (1953). 
          p. 222) </p>

      <p>Consider this summary by Joseph Free: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><i>We pointed out that numerous passages of the Bible which long puzzled 
          the commentators have readily yielded up their meaning when new light 
          from archaeological discoveries has been focused on them. In other words, 
          archaeology illuminates the text of the Scriptures and so makes valuable 
          contribution to the fields of Biblical interpretation and exegesis. 
          In addition to illuminating the Bible, archaeology has confirmed countless 
          passages which have been rejected by the critics as unhistorical or 
          contradictory to known facts. </i>(Free, J.P. <i>Archaeology and Bible 
          History. </i>Wheaton: Scripture Press Publication, Inc. 1973)</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In the area of the tests for historical reliability for Scripture - the 
      Bible has shown itself to be trustworthy. This allows us to place confidence 
      in the truthfulness of it's claims. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3>Conclusion </h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>There are usually two ways to approach verbal plenary inspiration: </p>
  <p>Above argument (Christological), coupled with the historical reliability 
    of the gospels. </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The argument may start by providing evidence for Jesus' messiahship (primarily 
      messianic prophecy); then look at Jesus' view of scripture and then the 
      historical reliability of the text (bibliographical, external, and internal 
      evidence). Volumes of material have been written on this subject. Or, the 
      starting point might instead be the historical reliability of the Bible, 
      and then look at what Jesus says about the Word's inspiration. Regardless 
      of the starting point, the crux of the defense is Christ's perspective of 
      the Bible. </p>
    <p>Another line of evidence: &quot;The integrity of the Bible's message&quot; 
      (overhead). The biblical message corresponds with reality in a way that 
      no other worldview does.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When approaching difficulties in scripture, Christians should remember Jesus' 
    view of it. The heart of the issue of inspiration is that if we come to Christ 
    believing his words of salvation then we must also believe his words about 
    the Bible. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Memory Verses </h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>2 Timothy 3:16,17* - All scripture is &quot;God-breathed.&quot; </p>
  <p>2 Peter 1:20,21* - All scripture has its origin in God rather than in humans. 
  </p>

<h3>Assignment </h3>

    7 and 9. </p>

<h3><b><b><a name="a1"></a>Introduction </b></b></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Having settled on <b>Dispensational pre-millennialism</b> as the 
    best way to understand the Bible's eschatological material, we want to elaborate 
    on that picture. There is an immense amount of biblical material to correlate, 
    and because of this there is some disagreement on some of the details. We 
    want to get the main picture tonight. </p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>There's lots of prophetic material associated with the final days. 
      </b>We won't be able to address every question or show how prediction 
      fits. </p>
    <p><b>We assume you have done your homework assignment</b>, so we 
      will only allude to (rather than cover) the passages involved in many of 
      these end-times events. </p>
    <p><b>See the Old Testament and New Testament prophecy charts&#151;they 
      help to correlate this material.</b> See also J. Dwight Pentecost, 
      <i>Things To Come</i> and John Walvoord, <i>Daniel: The Key To Prophetic 
      Revelation</i> for solid Dispensational treatments. </p>
  </blockquote>
 
  <p><b>We will use the Olivet Discourse (Matt. 24:1-31**) as our anchor 
    text.</b> While it doesn't cover all the events, it is the most comprehensive 
    passage concerning the end times. </p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The disciples actually ask three questions because they assumed that the 
      destruction of the Temple would herald the end of the age. Actually, the 
      Temple was destroyed in 70 AD, while Jesus' coming and the end of the age 
      has obviously not yet occurred. </p>
    <p>Matthew only records Jesus' response to the disciples' last two questions. 
      Luke&nbsp;21:20-24 records his answer to their first question. Jesus answers 
      the question about the sign of &quot;end&quot; in Matt. 24:15, and the question 
      about the sign of his coming in Matt. 24:30.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="a2"></a><b>The Church Age </b></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>The entire period from the death of Christ through the Rapture is called 
    a &quot;mystery&quot; because it was not clearly revealed in the Old Testament.</b>&nbsp; 
    (Rom. 11:25) The Old Testament prophets did not understand that God would 
    temporarily suspend his work through Israel and instead work through the church 
    to bring the news of salvation to all people-groups. Jesus calls this period 
    &quot;the times of the Gentiles&quot; (Lk. 21:24). The Church receives a partial, 
    unforeseen fulfillment of the New Covenant. Therefore, virtually all of our 
    information about the Church Age comes from the New Testament. </p>
  <p>The Matt. 13 parables describe the &quot;mysteries of the kingdom&quot;&#151;the 
    portion of God's kingdom which was not revealed in the Old Testament (Church 
    Age). While affirming that the kingdom will come in its fullness as predicted 
    by the Old Testament prophets, Jesus explains several key contrasts between 
    the Church Age and the Millennial Kingdom. (NO TIME FOR THIS LAST YEAR) </p>

<h3><b><a name="a5"></a>The Rapture </b></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>What is it? </b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Of the few passages which speak of the Rapture, 1 Thess. 4:13-18 and 1 
      Cor. 15:50-53 are the clearest. Christ will descend from heaven to catch 
      up all living and dead believers to meet him in the air. They receive their 
      resurrected bodies at this point. Therefore, <b>some Christians will never 
      experience physical death</b>. Instead, they will be instantly translated 
      like Enoch and Elijah in the Old Testament. </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><b>(1&nbsp;Thess. 4:16,17)</b> For the Lord himself will come down from 
        heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with 
        the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. (17) 
        After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together 
        with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be 
        with the Lord forever.</p>
      <p><b>(1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;15:50-53)</b> I declare to you, brothers, that flesh 
        and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit 
        the imperishable. (51) Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, 
        but we will all be changed&#151;(52) in a flash, in the twinkling of an 
        eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be 
        raised imperishable, and we will be changed. (53) For the perishable must 
        clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Why is it called the &quot;Rapture?&quot; &nbsp; </b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>This word is not found in the bible, but is derived from the Latin verb 
      <em>rapere </em>for "seized" or "caught up".&nbsp; We see this type of formulation 
      in 1 Thes. 4:17.</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><b>(1 Thes. 4:<small>17)</small></b><small> Then we who are alive and 
        remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the 
        Lord in the air, and thus we shall always be with the Lord.</small><br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>When will it occur?</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>None of the Rapture passages directly speak about the timing of the 
      Rapture in relation to the Second Advent.</b> Its timing must therefore 
      be inferred from other eschatological passages. <i>The key issue here is 
      how one understands God's commitment to Israel.&nbsp; If God's covenants 
      with Israel still stand, then the focus of God's dealing during the tribulation 
      will be with Israel. </i></p>
    <p><b>Covenantalists:</b></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><b>Because Covenantalists see the Church replacing Israel, they see the 
        Rapture as the first event of the Second Coming</b> (POST-TRIBULATIONAL 
        VIEW). </p>
      <p><b>Parousia: </b>The word <i>parousia</i> (&quot;coming&quot;), which 
        is repeatedly used to refer to the second coming of Christ, has a special 
        meaning in some cases. When a general staged a triumphal entry into a 
        city, the citizens would go out to meet him, and immediately return in 
        company with him and his army and/or captives. This could be the intended 
        meaning of the word when it is used in passages like 1 Thess. 4:15; 1 
        Cor. 15:23. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>Dispensationalist: </b></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><b>Because Dispensationalists see the Church as a parenthesis in God's 
        working through Israel, they see the Rapture as a distinct event separated 
        by a period of time</b> (PRE- or MID-TRIBULATIONAL VIEWS - the distinction 
        between these views is minor). As we have already seen, the focus of the 
        tribulation is on Israel rather than on the Church. </p>
      <p>If the Dispensational hermeneutic is accepted, there is ample additional 
        support for the Rapture as an event which precedes the Second Coming by 
        a significant period of time . </p>

            <li> 
              <p> The &quot;day of Christ&quot; is for the church and is looked 
                forward to<i> </i>(1 Cor. 1:8; 1 Cor. 5:5; 2 Cor. 1:14; Phil. 
                1:6). </p>
            </li>
            <li> 
              <p> The &quot;day of the Lord&quot; is for Israel and unbelievers 
                and is feared as a time of God's judgment (Is. 13:6,9 Is. 34:8; 
                Ezek. 30:3; Amos 5:18; Zeph. 1:7-13; 1 Thess. 5:2; 1 Thess. 3:2; 
                2 Thess. 2:2). </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p> God usually removes believers before he judges catastrophically 
            (e.g., Noah; Lot). Several New Testament passages suggest that he 
            will remove Christians before the Tribulation (2 Pet. 2:5-9; 1 Thess. 
            1:10; 5:9). </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>Note: The desire to believe in a pre-tribulational Rapture because 
          it means deliverance from suffering is suspect and unhealthy.</b> The 
          New Testament predicts that <i>all </i>committed Christians will be 
          persecuted to some extent (2 Tim. 3:12), persecution has been the norm 
          for Christians for the whole Church Age, and more Christians were martyred 
          in the 20th century than in all previous 19 centuries combined! (Need 
          citation.) Do you hold this view because you don't want to suffer&#151;or 
          because it makes the most sense? </p>
      <p>Application<b>:</b> How should the Rapture affect us as Christians? </p>
      <p>1 Thes. 4:13,18 says we should not grieve hopelessly about Christian 
        friends who die, because we'll see them again on that day. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>(1 Thess. 4:13,18) But we do not want you to be uninformed, brethren, 
          about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve, as do the rest 
          who have no hope&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; (18) Therefore comfort one 
          another with these words.</p>
        <p>1 Cor. 15:58 says we should keep abounding in ministry because this 
          work has eternal impact.</p>
        <p>(1 Cor. 15:58) Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, 
          always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is

<h3><b><a name="a7"></a>The Judgment-Seat of Christ (1 Cor. 3:10-15**) </b></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>(1 Cor. 3:10-15**)</b> According to the grace of God which was given to 
    me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building 
    upon it. But let each man be careful how he builds upon it. (11) For no man 
    can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 
    (12) Now if any man builds upon the foundation with gold, silver, precious 
    stones, wood, hay, straw, (13) each man's work will become evident; for the 
    day will show it, because it is to be revealed with fire; and the fire itself 
    will test the quality of each man's work. (14) If any man's work which he 
    has built upon it remains, he shall receive a reward. (15) If any man's work 
    is burned up, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so 
    as through fire.</p>
  <p><b>What is the purpose of this judgment? </b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>This judgment evaluates the service Christians rendered to Christ in 
      this life.</b> Like the judgment of Olympic contestants, <b>it evaluates 
      our performance for the purpose of reward, not acceptance.</b> Paul makes 
      it clear that Christians could receive no reward, yet still be saved (1&nbsp;Cor. 
      3:15). Therefore, while this judgment should sober us, we should not fear 
      it as the place where we may be rejected by God. </p>
    <p><b>Furthermore, Christ will be perfectly fair in his evaluation.</b> He 
      will take into account all the differences in our gifting, opportunities, 
      etc.&#151;and he will evaluate us by what we did with what he has entrusted 
      us (Matt. 25:14-23). For this reason, some who appeared to be great will 
      be rewarded less than those who were little-known&#151;and vice-versa. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>When will it occur? </b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>It is not clear when this judgment takes place. The most logical place 
      is immediately after the Rapture. </b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>What is the reward?</b></p>
  <p>The reward is multifaceted, including: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>The satisfaction of seeing the true significance of our work for Christ 
      </b>(1 Cor. 3:13 &quot;each man's work will become evident&quot;&#151;<b>not 
      to Jesus, but to us). </b> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>(1 Cor. 3:13)</b> &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;each man's work will 
          become evident; for the day will show it, because it is to be revealed 
          with fire; and the fire itself will test the quality of each man's work.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li><b>God's praise for faithful service.</b> This may include bestowing different 
      degrees of glory on us (Rom. 8:18; 2 Cor. 4:17). 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>(1 Cor. 4:5)</b> Therefore do not go on passing judgment before 
          the time, but wait until the Lord comes who will both bring to light 
          the things hidden in the darkness and disclose the motives of men's 
          hearts; and then each man's praise will come to him from God.</p>
        <p><b>(Matt. 25:20-23)</b> &quot;And the one who had received the five 
          talents came up and brought five more talents, saying, 'Master, you 
          entrusted five talents to me; see, I have gained five more talents.' 
          (21) &quot;His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful slave; 
          you were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many 
          things, enter into the joy of your master.' (22) &quot;The one also 
          who had received the two talents came up and said, 'Master, you entrusted 
          to me two talents; see, I have gained two more talents.' (23) &quot;His 
          master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful slave; you were faithful 
          with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into 
          the joy of your master.'</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li><b>Roles of rulership in God's eternal kingdom.&nbsp; </b>Responsibility 
      in God's future kingdom will be given according to our faithfulness to Christ 
      in this life (Lk. 19:17,19). 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>(Luke 19:17-19)</b> &quot;And he said to him, 'Well done, good slave, 
          because you have been faithful in a very little thing, be in authority 
          over ten cities.' (18) &quot;And the second came, saying, 'Your mina, 
          master, has made five minas.' (19) &quot;And he said to him also, 'And 
          you are to be over five cities.'</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>Conclusion:</b> 2 Cor. 4:17 For momentary, light affliction is producing 
    for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison,18 while we look 
    not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for 
    the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen 
    are eternal.

    <li> 
      <p>The reward resounds throughout eternity.</p>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <p>It is absolutely fair.&nbsp; We are evaluated based on what we did with 
        what we had (Matt. 19:30).</p>

  <p>Read Matt. 24:15-20. Notice Jesus assumes that the Temple will be rebuilt 
    (vs 15) and that the Jews will be in Judea practicing some form of Old Testament 
    observance (vs 16,20). This is one of many Old and New Testament passages 
    that predict the dispersion of the Jewish nation for their sins&#151;and their 
    future regathering as a precursor to the end of the age and the Messianic 
    kingdom (Deut. 28:58-68; 30:1-6; Ezek. 38:8; Lk. 21:24). </p>

      became a nation again in 1948. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Jerusalem must be back in the hands of the Jews</b> (Zech. 12,14; Lk.

    <p><b>Fulfillment:</b> This occurred in 1967 as a result of the 6 Day War. 
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><b>The Jews are regathered while still in an unregenerate state</b> (Ezek.

<h3><b><a name="a4">The Tribulation, Antichrist, &amp; Abomination of Desolation</a> 
  </b></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>The Tribulation is a time when God's focus returns to the nation 
    of Israel.</b> All of the passages (Old and New Testament) describe its 
    reference to Israel <i>rather than </i>to the Church. It is the &quot;70th&quot; 
    week of God's dealings with Israel (Dan. 9:27*). It is called &quot;the time 
    of Jacob's trouble&quot; (Jer. 30:7). Jesus calls it the &quot;great tribulation&quot; 
    (Matt. 24:15-28, see especially vs&nbsp;21,22). God works through the Tribulation 
    to prepare Israel for the Second Coming. </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>(Dan. 9:27*)</b> &quot;And he will make a firm covenant with the many 
      for one week, but in the middle of the week he will put a stop to sacrifice 
      and grain offering; and on the wing of abominations will come one who makes 
      desolate, even until a complete destruction, one that is decreed, is poured 
      out on the one who makes desolate.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>The Tribulation is approximately 7 years long&#151;the 70th &quot;week&quot; 
    of Dan. 9:27*. </b>This period is divided into two 3.5 year periods. 
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><b>During the first 3.5 years, the Antichrist rules the world</b> (Dan. 
        7:25; Rev. 13:5,7) through his military might (Dan. 11:38; Rev. 13:4) 
        and monetary control (Rev. 13:16,17). This will be a time of worldwide 
        peace (1 Thess. 5:2,3)&#151;but it will be a time of persecution for true 
        Christians (Dan. 7:25; Rev. 13:7). </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>At the midpoint, he will suspend regular Jewish sacrifices </b>(Dan. 
        9:27), <b>enter the temple and demand to be worshipped</b> (2 Thess. 2:4; 
        Dan. 11:31; Matt. 24:15). This is the &quot;abomination of desolation.&quot; 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>This act precipitates a 3.5 year period of judgment by God on the 
        Antichrist.</b> Various nations rebel against his rule (Dan. 11:40-45), 
        culminating in a final battle in the Middle east (Armageddon&#151;Rev. 
        16:16). </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Ending event: Jesus returns at this point to rescue the world from 
        annihilation</b> ( Matt. 24:16-22). Many other passages describe this 
        period, including Dan. 9:27b; Dan. 7:26,27. It is often called &quot;the 
        day of the Lord&quot; because it is a time of God's judgment (2 Thess. 
        2:2; Joel 1:15; 2:1,11,31; 3:14). </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>The central figure of the Tribulation is the &quot;Antichrist.&quot;</b> 
    He is also known as the &quot;little horn&quot; (Dan. 7:8), the &quot;man 
    of sin&quot; (2 Thes. 2:3), and &quot;the one who makes desolate&quot; (Dan. 
    9:27*). Among his important features: (THIS WAS COVERED LAST WEEK) </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>He is a Gentile.</b> He arises from a 10-nation Gentile confederacy 
      (Dan. 2:41,42; 7:7-10). He arises from the sea (Rev. 13:1), which is a reference 
      to the Gentile nations (Rev. 17:15). </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><b>(Rev. 13:1,2)</b> And the dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And 
        I saw a beast coming out of the sea. He had ten horns and seven heads, 
        with ten crowns on his horns, and on each head a blasphemous name. (2) 
        The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear 
        and a mouth like that of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power and 
        his throne and great authority.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>He achieves world wide power </b>for a brief period of time 
      (Rev. 13:8; Dan. 7:23-25). </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><b>(Rev. 13:8)</b> All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast&#151;all 
        whose names have not been written in the book of life belonging to the 
        Lamb that was slain from the creation of the world.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>He sets himself up as an object of worship</b> </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><b>(Dan 11:36,37)</b>&nbsp; &quot;The king will do as he pleases. 
        He will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will say unheard-of 
        things against the God of gods. He will be successful until the time of 
        wrath is completed, for what has been determined must take place. (37) 
        He will show no regard for the gods of his fathers or for the one desired 
        by women, nor will he regard any god, but will exalt himself above them 
        all.&quot;. </p>
      <p><b>(Rev. 13:4)</b> Men worshiped the dragon because he had given authority 
        to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, &quot;Who is 
        like the beast? Who can make war against him?&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>He is energized by Satan</b> (Rev. 13: 4)</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><b>(2 Thess. 2:9)</b> The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance 
        with the work of Satan displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracles, 
        signs and wonders,</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>He is a great adversary of believers</b><i> </i></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><b>(Dan 7: 25)</b> &quot;And he will speak out against the 
        Most High and wear down the saints of the Highest One, and he will intend 
        to make alterations in times and in law; and they will be given into his 
        hand for a time, times, and half a time.&quot;. </p>
      <p><b>(Rev. 13:7)</b> He was given power to make war against the saints 
        and to conquer them. And he was given authority over every tribe, people, 
        language and nation.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>He hates Jesus Christ</b><i> </i></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><b>(Rev 17:14) </b>&quot;They will make war against the Lamb, 
        but the Lamb will overcome them because he is Lord of lords and King of 
        kings&#151;and with him will be his called, chosen and faithful followers.&quot;. 
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>He is accompanied by &quot;the false prophet,&quot;</b><i> 
      </i>a Jewish(?) leader who helps his rise to power by using miraculous powers 
      to persuade people to follow him (Rev. 13:11-14). </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><b>(Rev. 13:11-14) </b>Then I saw another beast, coming out of the earth. 
        He had two horns like a lamb, but he spoke like a dragon. (12) He exercised 
        all the authority of the first beast on his behalf, and made the earth 
        and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been 
        healed. (13) And he performed great and miraculous signs, even causing 
        fire to come down from heaven to earth in full view of men. (14) Because 
        of the signs he was given power to do on behalf of the first beast, he 
        deceived the inhabitants of the earth. He ordered them to set up an image 
        in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived.</p>

<h3><b><a name="a9"></a>The Millennial Kingdom </b></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Mortal believers who are still alive at the Second Coming enter the 
    Millennial Kingdom</b>. They still die, though after a longer life (Isa. 
    65:20,21), therefore they have mortal bodies. They are evidently still fallen, 
    as inferred from various judgments and the fact that they die. They have children 
    (Isa. 65:23) and repopulate the earth (inferred from Rev. 20:8). The curse 
    on nature is evidently ameliorated removed to some extent (Isa. 65:25). </p>
  <p><b>Satan is bound in the abyss for most of this period</b>, which 
    lasts for 1000 years (Rev. 20:2,3,4,5,6,7). </p>
  <p><b>Satan is released at the end of this period and incites a rebellion 
    against Jesus, at which time he is thrown into hell.</b> This evidently 
    demonstrates that the problem with humans is not environmental, but moral 
    and spiritual. Even in a perfect environment and a perfectly just government, 
    humans still revolt. It is also probably the final piece of evidence for Satan's 
    condemnation. </p>
  <p><b>Jesus rules from Jerusalem</b> (Obadiah 1:12-20; Zech. 14:16). 
    Gentiles come to Jerusalem to worship the Lord (Zech. 14:16-21). Jews have 
    a new temple and offer commemorative sacrifices there (Ezek. 40-48). Resurrected 
    believers may participate in the administration of the messianic kingdom (Matt.

    before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which 
    is the book of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written 
    in the books, according to their deeds. (13) And the sea gave up the dead 
    which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; 
    and they were judged, every one of them according to their deeds. (14) And 
    death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, 
    the lake of fire. (15) And if anyone's name was not found written in the book

      a loud voice from the throne, saying, &quot;Behold, the tabernacle of God 
      is among men, and He shall dwell among them, and they shall be His people, 
      and God Himself shall be among them, (4) and He shall wipe away every tear 
      from their eyes; and there shall no longer be any death; there shall no 
      longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed 
      away.&quot; (5) And He who sits on the throne said, &quot;Behold, I am making 
      all things new.&quot; And He said, &quot;Write, for these words are faithful 
      and true.&quot; (6) And He said to me, &quot;It is done. I am the Alpha 
      and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to the one who thirsts 
      from the spring of the water of life without cost. (7) &quot;He who overcomes 
      shall inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son. 
      (8) &quot;But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers 
      and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part 
      will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second 
      death.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>This is the eternal state. God destroys our present universe </b>(Rev. 
    21:1; 2 Pet. 3:10-13) <b>and creates a new universe in which his reign endures 
    forever</b> (Rev. 21:1-22:5). </p>
  <p>How can God give people free will in this state and yet guarantee that there 
    will never be a rebellion again? Part of the answer may be that we will be 
    able to see the complete record of revolt against God, the full demonstration 
    that only he has the right to rule (Isa. 66:24). </p>

<h3><b><a name="a6"></a>The Intermediate States </b></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Where do people go after they die, but before their eternal states?</b> 
    Are they conscious or not? These are the questions most people have about 
    the intermediate state. There is not a lot of material on this subject, but 
    we can infer what might happen. </p>
  <p><b>Believers are divided into two groups: </b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Those who died before Christ's death</b> went to a waiting place which 
      Jesus called &quot;Abraham's Bosom&quot; (Lk. 16:22). They were conscious 
      and comforted. They evidently could not go into God's presence because their 
      sins had not yet been paid for in history. 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>(Luke 16:22)</b> &quot;The time came when the beggar died and the 
          angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was 
          buried.&quot;</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li><b>Those who die after Christ's death</b> go directly to be consciously 
      with Christ in heaven (2 Cor. 5:8; Phil. 1:23; Lk. 23:43). However, they 
      do not receive their resurrected bodies until the Rapture (1 Cor. 15:52). 
    </li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b>(Luke 23:43)</b> Jesus answered him, &quot;I tell you the truth, today 
        you will be with me in paradise.&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>Therefore, the New Testament refers to dead Christians as &quot;asleep&quot; 
      not because they are unconscious, but to emphasize that they will be raised 
      from the dead just as a sleeping person will awaken</b> (<i>contra</i> &quot;SOUL 
      SLEEP&quot;). </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Nonbelievers:</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>Nonbelievers evidently go to a waiting place Jesus called &quot;Hades&quot;</b> 
      (Lk. 16:23). They are conscious and in agony&#151;probably because they 
      are aware of their coming judgment. They will be raised at the end of the 
      Millennial Kingdom to be judged and sentenced to hell (Rev. 20:11-15). </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><b>(Luke 16:23)</b> &quot;And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in 
        torment, and saw Abraham far away, and Lazarus in his bosom.</p>
      <p><b>(Rev. 20:13,14)</b> The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and 
        death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was 
        judged according to what he had done. (14) Then death and Hades were thrown 
        into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death.</p>

        chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, 
        nor can anyone cross over from there to us.'</p>

<h3><b>Assignment </b></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Answer the following questions concerning Christology. </b></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p> Could Jesus fall to temptation or not? See Lk. 4:1-12 and Jas. 1:13. 
        Use scripture to support your answer. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> What limitations did Jesus take on by becoming a human being? See Jn. 
        5:19,30; 8:28; 12:49; 14:10; Acts 2:22; 10:38; Phil. 2:6,7. What application 
        does this have for the Christian life? </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Where did Jesus go between his death and resurrection? See 1 Pet. 3:19; 
        4:6; Eph. 4:9. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Why is the resurrection of Jesus important? See Mt. 12:39,40; Jn. 2:19; 
        Rom. 4:25; 6:4,5; 1 Cor. 15:14,17,18-23; Eph. 1:19,20; 2:6; 1 Pet. 1:3. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> What is Jesus doing now? See Eph. 1:20-23; Heb. 7:25; Rom. 8:34; 1 Jn. 
        2:1,2. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Which of these issues are essential? Which are not? Why? </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

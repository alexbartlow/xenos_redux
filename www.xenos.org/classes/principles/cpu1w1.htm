<h3><strong><font face="Arial" size="3">Introduction </font></strong></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><strong>(Eph 4:11,12)</strong> It was 
    he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, 
    and some to be pastors and teachers, (12) to prepare God's people for works 
    of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up&#133;</font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The purpose of this course: </font></b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Our role as teachers is to <i>equip 
      </i>you, for <i>works of service.</i> The Biblical model of the church relies 
      on the work of every member and not only the pastors and teachers. This 
      is one weakness of many churches today: an unhealthy reliance on the clergy 
      for performance of God's work. When the people are mobilized to serve God 
      in the church, they benefit and the Lord's causes are more greatly advanced.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Over the next four units we 
    will cover... </font></strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Unit 1: Foundations of Spiritual 
      Growth.</strong> This lays a groundwork of most basic areas of theology. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Unit 2: Dynamics of Spiritual 
      Growth.</strong> This covers the key concepts involved in sanctification 
      (EXAMPLES: new identity; faith; flesh; law; Holy Spirit). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Unit 3: Provisions for Spiritual 
      Growth. </strong>This focuses especially on your part in sanctification 
      (means of growth), and bibliology </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Unit 4: Challenges &amp; 
      Opportunities of Spiritual Growth. </strong>This covers 5 key areas which 
      are a necessary part of effectively playing your role (EVANGELISM; STEWARDSHIP; 
      SPIRITUAL WARFARE; DECISION-MAKING; IDENTIFYING AND USING YOUR GIFTS).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>REMINDER ABOUT HOME GROUP 
      REQUIREMENT</strong>: According to Col. 2:2, real spiritual knowledge of 
      Christ (and the assurance that comes from that knowledge) requires that 
      we be &quot;knit together in love&quot; with other Christians.&nbsp;Academic 
      or &quot;classroom&quot; learning is only one dimension of your becoming 
      equipped.&nbsp;You need a practical context for putting this knowledge into 
      practice in relationships and ministry&#151;and a home group is the best 
      place for that to occur.&nbsp;Our statistics indicate that less than 50% 
      of people who are not in a home group finish the course, whereas over 70% 
      of those who attend a home group finish.</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">If you are not yet involved in 
        a home group, but intending to get into one, you can stay in this class 
        as long as you get into one before the end of the quarter. Talk to your 
        instructor at the break to find out more about becoming involved in a 
        home group.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <h3><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Take note! (Manage expectations for 
    this class) </font></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Not every truth/doctrine 
      will have immediate application.</strong> Store it away for future use . 
      . . </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>This is not like central 
      teaching.</strong> The teacher must cover more material in more depth, etc. 
      He cannot always be at his homiletical best. We expect you to exert more 
      effort to concentrate, ask questions, take notes, etc. . . . </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>This class requires perseverance, 
      like any long-term goal.</strong> It will get tedious at times, and Satan 
      will try to get you to quit. We know sometimes people must drop out for 
      legitimate reasons, but determine before God now that you won't quit for 
      illegitimate reasons!!</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>We also recommend that you 
      get a study partner.</strong>&nbsp; This is one reason we require home group 
      membership to be in Principles.&nbsp; It will increase your understanding 
      of the material, increase your ability to apply the material personally, 
      and it will deepen your relationship with your study partner.&nbsp; Ideally, 
      this should be with someone in your home group, but it may also be someone 
      in this class.</font></li>

<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Four Statements about the Centrality of Missions</font></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>If you plan to become a worker 
    for God, you need an understanding of God's overall purpose.</strong> (We 
    begin with the end in mind.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Definition:</strong> When we 
    say &quot;missions&quot; tonight, we are referring to God's core purpose for

    notes.)&nbsp; We are going to look at some passage that through time increasingly

  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Xenos Mission Statement:</strong> 
    </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">God has called on the church to cooperate 
      with him as he reconciles the world to himself (2 Corinthians 5:19). Therefore, 
      Xenos Christian Fellowship exists to help people learn to draw close to 
      God. This work begins by inviting people to receive the gift of forgiveness 
      offered through Christ.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We are committed to fostering spiritual 
      growth by encouraging people to respond to God's love through loving service 
      toward God and all people. Specifically, we direct our resources to serving 
      the family, the non-Christian community locally and internationally, and 
      the broader Christian community. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">There is nothing different about Xenos 
    in this regard. We have been blessed by God (in part) because we have continued 
    to obey the light that we have received. That light has consistently moved 
    us in the direction described here. But God is not dependent on us to accomplish 
    his purpose. If we move away from this purpose or shrink back from the steps 
    of faith he asks&nbsp; us to take (domestic work and frontier work and example 
    for others), God will find someone else to use.&nbsp; We will be bypassed 
    in that sense, begin to experience inner &quot;rot&quot; and become eventually 
    an empty husk.&nbsp; We are committed to not letting that happen in our lifetime. 
    </font></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The church is the only social 
    entity that exists primarily for the benefit of its nonmembers.</font></strong></p>

<h3><strong><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name="a4"></a>4. Missions is a key 
  to victorious Christian living</font></strong></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The average Christian bookstore is 
    glutted with books on how to appropriate God's blessings for <i>you</i>, how 
    to be all God wants <i>you</i> to be. American narcissistic, therapeutic, 
    self-absorbed &quot;spirituality&quot; is antithetical to biblical spirituality. 
    Where are the books that teach us how to follow, suffer for and die for Christ?&nbsp;They 
    don't sell, so they aren't printed, so Christians don't read them.&nbsp;But 
    there is no lasting fulfillment in Christianity apart from this!! </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><strong>(John 12:24,25)</strong> 
      I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, 
      it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. (25) 
      The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life 
      in this world will keep it for eternal life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><strong>(Mark 8:34,35) </strong>Then 
      he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: &quot;If anyone 
      would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow 
      me. (35) For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses 
      his life for me and for the gospel will save it.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Any spirituality which merely 
    develops and fulfills that individual, and does not focus on God's mission, 
    is unbiblical and therefore doomed to failure and disappointment. </strong></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Recall that by mission we mean the 
      extension of God's blessing (redemption and rule) to all people.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Have you ever given up your small 
      ambitions? &nbsp; Have you ever laid down your plans for your life, asking 
      God to bless your agenda&#151;and told him: &quot;Here is my life&#151;use 
      it to fulfill your purpose?&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong>The goal of this Class is to help equip 
  you to play your role in this purpose.</strong></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is not primarily for self-improvement, 
    knowledge quest or experiences with God. Though all of these are good, and 
    may happen in this class, they are a byproduct of following Christ into his 
    purpose. </font></p>
 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><strong>(Eph. 4:11,12)</strong> It 
      was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, 
      and some to be pastors and teachers, (12) to prepare God's people for works 
      of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up . . . </font></p>

    </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Xenos has set out to build a highly 
      trained, sophisticated, caring, leadable, cohesive, committed, and flexible 
      workforce of Christian servants who continually strive to serve the Lord 
      and do his will. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This is one of the big reasons why 
    we urge you to be actively involved in evangelism and a home group. In this 
    context, you can practice this lifestyle, and begin to share what you are 
    learning with others. </font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Gen. 12:1-3**</strong> - The 
    Abrahamic covenant, in which God promised to provide his redemptive blessing 
    to the world through Abraham's descendants. Key elements of the promise: land, 
    nationhood, personal blessing, and all the nations blessed through one of 
    Abraham's descendants.</font></p>
 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Matt. 28:18-20*</strong> - 
    The Great Commission, in which Jesus commands the church to both evangelize 
    and train people from every people group. </font></p>

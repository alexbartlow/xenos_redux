<h3><font size="+1">I. The Need For Planting Strategies</font></h3>
</font></b> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">Nobody knows how house churches multiplied within a city 
    in New Testament times, but they must have done so. This is because no church 
    buildings or references to church buildings have been found dating from the 
    apostolic period, or post-apostolic period. This is in contrast to the period 
    from the late second century onward, when church buildings are mentioned frequently.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Instead, we find frequent references to house churches, usually 
    in conjunction with public space (like the schoolroom of Tyrannus, Acts 19:9). 
    The natural limitation on group size imposed by meeting in houses is conducive 
    to several features of <a href="../um2-7.htm">church life</a> envisioned in 
    the New Testament. Staying in homes would dictate that Home Churches remain 
    relatively small, which would facilitate body life and real community. As 
    they grew, they must have been divided and new churches planted, resulting 
    in situations like that in Corinth, where Paul refers to the group as one 
    &quot;church in Corinth,&quot; but also as &quot;the churches&quot; apparently 
    referring to various house churches in the city.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Our strategies therefore, should create options that will 
    have the desired effect-- adding healthy, growing home churches, while respecting 
    any restrictions imposed by sound ministry ethics.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Following are several strategies used for successful house 
    church planting in the past. Remember that each of the existing models was 
    created at some time in the past by home church leaders, so we see no reason 
    why home church leaders today can't devise new methods, as long as we work 
    together and communicate our plans.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Today, Xenos requires a senior leader be named for new home 
    churches. Your sphere leader will help you decide who this should be for both 
    groups.</font></p>

      <p><font size="+1">a) In this method, the leadership, teachers, and workers 
        of the home church are divided as evenly as possible, hopefully along 
        existing lines of influence in the home church. For instance, if you have 
        two couples leading together, each couple takes their disciples and related 
        friends, groups, ministry houses, and guests, and adds new leadership 
        as needed before parting ways.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">b) This model promotes equality between the groups in 
        terms of experience. The conventional model seems to also offer a sense 
        of continuity to the people in that they have some of the same leaders 
        to look to, and usually they have their friends with them as well. The 
        results have, so far, been good. To date, the conventional model remains 
        the most successful model in use.</font></p>

      <p><font size="+1">a) Unless they are careful, the home church leaders could 
        suffer major disruption of their long-standing relationships when planting 
        this way. After working together with a team for years, separating from 
        them could be difficult for some leaders. In-depth relationships and spiritual 
        community support are just as important for leaders as for non-leaders. 
        Further, while suffering for the sake of the gospel is reasonable and 
        biblical, we don't want leaders to become aversive to further church planting 
        attempts, or to lose effectiveness because of depression.<br>
        <br>
        To avoid such hazards, leaders in a conventional church plant should plan 
        ahead carefully. The leaders need to build deeply into relationships with 
        others (usually their disciples) who will accompany them in the new church, 
        because they won't have their former fellow-leaders with them any more. 
        If we build ministry spheres, and whole cell groups are sent out together, 
        people should already have good relationships in the new group.</font></p>

            they would have been &quot;sitting in&quot; leaders' meetings for
            some time). Both new teams should already be looking
            forward to possible future planting plans.</font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">(2) We prefer to delay recognizing new Home church 
            leaders until time for the plant in order to keep the focus on home 
            church planting. Exceptions would include spouses, where one spouse 
            is a leader and the other is not, or a clear need for more home church 
            leaders in the current home church.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">3. Transition</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">a) After the leaders decide how they will plant the group, 
        go over your plans with the rest of the home church members to make sure 
        they agree to go to the side you envision for them. In the case of those 
        not in a cell group, you may need to discuss their options one-on-one. 
        Be sure everyone decides which side they will attend before the actual 
        plant to avoid a lopsided division or &quot;church-tasting.&quot; A taste-test 
        approach could amount to a popularity contest, which would be unedifying. 
        <br>
        <br>
        We think people should be taught that an important basis for deciding 
        where to go is where they can be used by God the most--that is, where 
        they are needed. Other criteria could include relational history and ministry 
        investment. Remember, however, we can't replicate churches and at the 
        same time stay with everything and everyone with whom we have invested. 
        In cases where ministry spheres are clearly defined everyone will know 
        where they belong and little needs to be said. Normally, the church plant 
        should be known to all for months in advance, if not a year or more. But 
        we should never try to compel people to go to a particular home church 
        against their will.</font></p>

    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">a. In the Mission Church model, the leaders of the original
           home church stay together, while sending out an all-new leadership
          team 
        with their own home church.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">b. In theory this model has much to commend it, because
           the new leaders get the opportunity to take the next step in ministry
          
        maturity-- taking responsibility for their own home church. This is an
           opportunity and a challenge that sometimes results in unexpected progress
          
        in the lives of the new leaders. This experience sometimes bears out
          the  theory that some people won't learn to swim until the water gets
          too deep 
        for wading.<br>
        <br>
        On the other hand, be sure the new leaders actually have the ministry
         power to do the job. To date, the mission model has been problematic,
        
        resulting in a somewhat higher proportion of failures, so try to be sure
         the new leaders are ready. Your home group sphere leader and the elders
        must 
        agree that your mission church is sufficiently experienced and trained
         to make success plausible.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Also, the new church should plan on remaining in a mentoring
           relationship with the parent church for a period of months (3 to 6
          months or 
        more is typical). The parent church, in consultation with their oversight
           leaders, should decide when they are no longer needed. One method
          for 
        insuring adequate supervision is to alternate between separate home church
           leaders meetings and joint home church leaders' meetings for a period
          
        of time after the plant. Finally, if the mission church looks shakey,
          sphere leaders may call on the planting church to &quot;warrant&quot; the new
          plant. If it later fails, the sending church would be obligated to
          receive them back,
          so
          planting 
        a failing church is a major waste of time and effort.</font></p>

  <ul>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">a. The size of the mission church should be adequate. 
        In most cases, this means the actual attendance at the new church (rather 
        than the list of members) should usually be in the upper teens or higher 
        if a student or singles' group, and over twelve if middle-aged. In general, 
        small churches are vulnerable to demoralization during times when a proportion 
        of their membership are missing for vacations etc. or some members are 
        lost. People may feel like the extremely small size of the group signals 
        failure, and may lose confidence. Let the mission group have the larger 
        numbers. The experienced side is far less likely to fail, and therefore 
        can be smaller.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">An exception to this would be cases where ad-hoc Bible
          studies have been started by members in the sending church, and growth
          has justified planting them off as a new home church. Such groups may
          be quite small.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">b. The new (mission) leaders should already have their 
        own cell groups before the planting attempt occurs, and the people in 
        those cells should have demonstrated real life-changing growth before 
        the planting attempt. This is the best proof of readiness on the part 
        of the new leaders. Be sure each cell group has &quot;top-end&quot; and 
        &quot;low-end&quot; potential (i.e. potential future leaders, and potential 
        outreach to new people).</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">c. Try to build a &quot;church within a church,&quot; 
        in the sense that all of the functions of home church life and growth 
        are evident within the sphere of the new leaders before the planting attempt. 
        In this way the leadership can determine that the new leaders are sufficiently 
        mature and experienced in Christian work to succeed in their own home 
        church. Also, the new home church will already have a structural and relational 
        basis for carrying on its ministry with a minimum of disruption. </font></p>

    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">a. The new leadership should have been sitting in on 
        leader's meetings for at least a period of months learning how to lead 
        a home church, how to think about ministry, and how to relate to other 
        leaders. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">b. In addition, try having the new team meet with each 
        other separate from the old leaders periodically. This enables them to 
        get used to taking initiative and working with each other without help. 
        They should evaluate their own ministry sphere, and determine what action 
        to take in various ministry situations. Then, they can report to the old 
        leaders on their conclusions. This should provide an opportunity for a 
        fairly realistic look at the ministry dynamic in the mission church before 
        actually taking the risk involved in planting.<br>
        <br>
        </font><font size="+1">When the new leaders report on their ministry decisions 
        they should also explain their thinking. In cases where judgment is involved, 
        encourage the new leaders to implement their own decisions, and note the 
        outcome. The older leaders should only overrule the new leaders' judgment 
        in cases where they see clear evidence that serious damage might result. 
        Until we can trust the ministry judgment of the new leaders, we can't 
        really have confidence in their ability to lead a new church.</font></p>

        for Two&quot; planting attempt. This is to be distinguished from a reorganization, 
        which may involve more than one church, but does not result in an actual 
        gain in numbers of home churches. We have also seen 4 for 3 or 5 for 4 
        arrangements, especially when opening up a new geographical area or special 
        field (age group, special affinities, etc.). </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">b. In most situations, a &quot;three for two&quot; planting 
        attempt is the result of an inequity in growth, either at the upper, or 
        lower end. In other words, a home church may have grown in terms of numbers 
        without having raised up adequate leadership (excessive low-end growth) 
        or has developed leaders without having grown very much in numbers (excessive 
        high-end growth). Both of these situations are problematic.</font></p>

          <p><font size="+1">I</font><font size="+1">) In the case of the &quot;low-end 
            only&quot; church, why has the church increased in numbers but not 
            in leaders? Has there been an activistic focus that might result in 
            a superficial understanding of community and maturity (i.e. evangelism 
            is the only thing that matters)? If so, such a group needs to grow 
            up into the fullness of Christ, and build real depth, or they will 
            always need to depend on others to supply their leadership. The leadership, 
            in consultation with their supervision, need to determine whether 
            it might be better to wait in a no-growth situation, using the crowding 
            as incentive to complete the work of discipleship.</font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">ii) In the case of the &quot;top-end only&quot; church, 
            a different question arises. Namely, if the leaders are so mature 
            and numerous, why is no one interested in listening to their message? 
            Are there moral or ideological problems (such as an unbalanced tribalism 
            or search theology) which will make them ill-suited to lead a group 
            of new Christians? Is their concept of maturity limited to a &quot;Bible 
            club&quot; mentality? Generally, if a home church needs more members, 
            the first place to seek them is in the world, not from another church!

            <br>
            These are the painful questions that have to be asked and resolved 
            in the case of a &quot;three for two&quot; church planting arrangement. 
            In cases where they can be resolved, the &quot;three for two&quot; 
            model has proven to be a successful model, answering many of the needs 
            for sharing resources. Upper level leaders, like the elders, Pastoral, 
            Student Ministries, or Adult Ministries staffers should get involved 
            in making this judgment.</font></p>

        a reasonable number of marginally involved people are being sent to join 
        the new group.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">b. Your sphere leader will undertake a search for a suitable 
        home church before that home church's leaders are approached. This is 
        to prevent friction between home churches as well as wasted time. It is 
        not our policy to have home churches canvassing the fellowship for &quot;three 
        for two&quot; arrangements, as this would waste much time, and cause unnecessary 
        stress on the part of home church leaders. Besides, one home church is 
        rarely in a position to assess what is happening in another, still less 
        the overall needs of the fellowship. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">c. If the supervisory staff find a possible home church 
        partner, the initiating home church leaders or sphere leader should approach 
        the other home church leaders only in confidential discussion. They should 
        carefully avoid the appearance of applying pressure to the other leaders 
        by agitating the members of the other home church. If the proposed partner 
        church is interested, negotiations can begin.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">d. The elders or supervisory staff should be informed 
        of the outcome of the negotiations. When everyone agrees, the workers 
        and members of the home churches should be approached. All who join the 
        planting attempt must agree freely to go. Leaders should avoid compelling 
        or pressuring people to go on the planting attempt. We may plead and persuade, 
        but not pressure.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">e. Before the plant, make sure the people from both sides 
        who will be in the new group meet with each other socially and in other 
        ways, so the first meeting of the new church is not the first time they 
        meet each other. Try to build community before going out.</font></p>

<h3><font size="+1"> <b>V. Deciding on A Church Planting Model</b></font> </h3>

  <p><font size="+1">1. Who makes the decision about which model to follow? </font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">a. This decision is made by the original home church
           leaders in consultation with the elders or staff supervisors. The
          elder's 
        policy is to extend freedom of choice to home church leaders in this
          area,  provided that reasonable requirements for survival of both new
          churches 
        are present. Also, the option being chosen should not cause excessive
           delays in planting. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">b. First, determine whether the original leaders want
           to continue working together. If one or more leaders prefer the challenge
          
        of starting a new home church with their own disciples, they are allowed
           to, given the same provisions as above (including approval from the
          sphere leaders). 
        Even in cases where the leaders of a given home church are unable to
          agree,  this basic right of the worker to stay with his/her work remains
          with 
        few exceptions.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">c. It should be obvious that if you intend to plant
          a  Mission Church, or a &quot;three for two&quot; home church, the
          new leaders  must also be willing to play their part. However, the
          decision for how 
        to plant should be made by the home church leaders and supervisory staff,
           not by potential leaders or members. It would definitely be erroneous
          
        to put the decision up for a vote in the home church, because the result
           would be confusion and dissension. Instead, the leaders should arrive
          
        at a solid defensible position, and then present it to the opinion leaders
           in the group, and finally to the whole church with full persuasion.</font></p>

<h3><font size="+1"> <b>VI. New Home Church Leadership Composition</b></font> 
</h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">1. When we plant home churches in Xenos, we are planting 
    a team. Thinking in terms of teams means studying things like the personality 
    composition of the leaders of both home churches. Studies of home church growth 
    have shown that some balance in the composition of personality types in a 
    leadership band is preferable. Also, some compositions should be avoided if 
    possible, because they tend to cause problems for growth and quality of fellowship.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">2. Types of composition to avoid.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">a. The most common problem in home church leader composition 
        is the all-passive leadership. In this context, &quot;passive&quot; means 
        that a person is, comparatively speaking, less directive in his/her ministry 
        style, and more fearful of confronting others. They are also less apt 
        to be abusive or forceful when they do confront than their more aggressive 
        brethren. <br>
        <br>
        On the negative side, the passive leader will tend to be less willing
        to initiate new projects or methods. They may be less strategic in their
        output because they tend to react to situations, rather than proactively
        creating new situations. Such leaders may find it hard to motivate people
        because people generally feel motivated more by innovative and aggressive
        personalities. But leaders with passive tendencies can overcome all these
        problems with experience and growth. They may also be too soft on issues
        of sin, whether of commission or omission.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">On the positive side, these kind of leaders often project 
        more warmth, and sometimes (though not always) more stability than the 
        aggressive type. They may be better able to project grace and kindness 
        in their relationships. They are definitely more apt to reflect before 
        acting, and therefore can serve as a needed restraint in situations where 
        the more aggressive leader is inclined to &quot;lunge.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font size="+1">i) When an entire leadership group is composed only 
            of this type, they face the dangers of apathy, indecisiveness and 
            boredom in the leaders as well as the members. To solve this problem, 
            no answer is as effective as introducing one or more aggressive leaders 
            into the home church. Repeatedly, passive leaders are the ones who 
            restrain aggressive ones from wrongful action. At the same time, they 
            depend on the aggressive leaders to demand action, and to provide 
            the stimulation that is so important for excitement and good evangelism. 
            This passive/aggressive duality may be related to the &quot;transactional/transformational&quot; 
            leadership duality found commonly in leadership literature of the 
            past two decades. Be sure to distinguish between positive aggression 
            and aggression that is only exercised in a negative way (i.e. a problem-oriented 
            outlook). Positive aggression involves initiation of ideas for solving 
            problems, and agitation for action. Those who are aggressive only 
            when expressing recriminations or demanding personal rights are not 
            reflecting a helpful leadership style.</font></p>

      <p><font size="+1">b. The all-aggressive leadership is much less common, 
        but no less problematic than the all-passive. In the few cases where leader 
        groups have been composed of all, or mostly aggressive leaders, the results 
        have been very poor. These home churches have manifested a lack of patience 
        toward the members of the home church. At the same time, they have a tendency 
        to change direction abruptly and erratically at times. </font></p>

            leaders of the opposite type. Study shows that diversity is important 
            in a leadership group. Leaders should realize that any feelings of 
            condescension toward other types of leaders are usually a very immature 
            expectation that everyone &quot;be like me,&quot; not to mention a 
            lack of humble recognition that &quot;I need others to balance my 
            extremism and oppose my self-indulgence.&quot; Leaders should expend 
            effort to appreciate the value of other types of people in the local

<ul>
  <ul>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">a. Subjective vs. objective leaders. Church leadership 
        composed of all subjective or all objective leaders have a poor record 
        in our fellowship. The all-emotional leadership is to be avoided because 
        of the danger of hysteria or panic. All cognitive teams tend to be too 
        boring to hold a group's interest.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">b. Male vs. female strength. Try to get an aggressive 
        passive balance in both sexes, even though this may lay outside your control. 
        Complete balance between men and woman is never possible, but relative 
        balance is a plus.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">d. Leaders who are &quot;stay at home&quot; or are depth-oriented 
        (tribalistic) in their relating, vs. those who tend to enjoy outreach 
        and new relationships (diffuse). If a home church is made up of all depth-oriented 
        leaders, the group will tend to become ingrown, and to many, suffocating. 
        If the leadership is all outreach and stimulation oriented, the group 
        might become shallow, activistic, and ill-suited to personal growth or 
        discipleship.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">e. Leaders and members strong in evangelism, vs. those 
        strong in pastoring and discipleship. Hopefully both new home churches 
        have those strong in high and low end work.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">f. Note; Many of these factors will automatically be

</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">4. <b>Timing</b>-- When the home church is already at a

      if we wait until we are able to provide leaders of both types. We are always

<h3><font size="+1"> <b>VII. Time Needed to Plant a Church</b></font> </h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><a name="leaderage"></a>1. We doubt that very many can be 
    adequate home church leaders in the modern western setting when less than 
    three years old in the Lord. In rare cases, we are prepared to bring in one 
    team member who may be as young as two years in the Lord (e.g. a spouse of 
    an older believer). Most Christians will need over four years of rapid spiritual 
    growth and learning before they will be ready.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">a. This position does not square well with the example
           of Paul, who apparently regularly installed leaders who were younger
          than 
        three years, and sometimes less than two years. However, Paul may have
           been drawing from a base of mature believing Jews and God-fearing
          Gentiles. 
        These would have been middle-aged men and women who knew the Bible and
           who had enjoyed a personal relationship with God for many years before
          
        meeting Christ. Even though they would have to learn an entirely new
          way  of doing things, these believers would have probably grown rapidly.
          The 
        same is sometimes true today when true Christians transfer in from other
           churches.<br>
        <br>
        Another limiting factor in our culture is the sophistication of fortifications
         raised up against the knowledge of Christ in the modern west. For instance,
        
        western people are literate and better educated, and this fact dictates
         that modern home church leaders be capable of a more sophisticated level
        
        of persuasion. Missionaries report on the other hand, that in many tribal
         cultures they successfully appoint leaders of house churches at a much
        
        earlier stage of growth than would be practical in the west. Also, the
         failure of family in the west and widespread drug use and sexual immorality
        
        are factors that leave young people often needing more time to grow before
         leading. On the other hand, a good background, or former spiritual growth
        
        in another church could shorten the time needed to be ready.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">b. Based on these factors, we suggest the period from
          beginning a new home church to the next planting attempt will usually
          need to be two years, sometimes longer. An exception would be college-aged
          home churches, where we find experienced leaders may often plant after
          less than two years. Set a goal in your church to plant again in 2
          years or in 3
        if this is the first time your team has lead a home church. Student home
        churches should plan on 2 years, or more  for their first church.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3><font size="+1"> <b>VIII. Other Considerations</b></font> </h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">1. Consider the time of year when planning home church planting 
    attempt. Certain times of the year are better than others. The most questionable 
    times are late November and December, and spring. The best times are late 
    summer/early fall and early winter after the holidays. Consult the past history 
    of your own group to discover if your group doesn't fit these norms.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">2. Your group supervisors (and through them, the elders) 
    should be informed if you are planning a church plant. You need to get an 
    outside perspective on your plan for the sake of objectivity, and the elders 
    reserve the authority to veto planting plans if necessary. Your plan will 
    need to be reviewed at several levels in our organization, so don't wait too 
    long.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">3. Some of the proposed new home church leaders may be objectionable
      to the fellowship at the time planned. Make
    sure they qualify well in advance of the proposed date for planting. Leaders
      requires the character requirements for a deacon in I&nbsp;Tim. 3.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">4. Marriages and likely marriages will have to be considered,
      especially if they involve leaders. The elders will resist plans to establish
      only one spouse as a servant team member, or home church leader, because
      of
    the very poor record of such arrangements in the past. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><font size="+1"> <b>IX. Execution</b></font> </h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">The object of a plan of execution is to move from one meeting 
    to two meetings in a way that is edifying and motivating. With adequate preparation, 
    you can usually avoid any of the likely problems, and make planting a time 
    of high excitement and vision. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">1. <b>Lack of understanding</b>-- The members don't understand 
      the reasons for, or the importance of, church planting. </font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">a. You should tackle this problem well in advance through 
        a process of careful instruction. It's often a good idea to begin pointed 
        instruction in cell groups months before the planting attempt. Even though 
        you may have taught on it earlier, you probably have new members in the 
        group who missed the earlier instruction. You should also take the initiative 
        in the home church meeting to lead the attitude of the home church in 
        the right direction a few weeks before planting. By taking initiative 
        early, you can avoid complaints and unedifying remarks from members who 
        don't understand. Ideally, the group has seen planting as its goal since 
        the time of the last plant.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">b. Point out that the home church's prayers to God (that 
        he would grant growth) have been answered. Comment that, &quot;We are 
        excited to realize that the job we embarked on three (?) years ago has 
        finally been completed!&quot; Argue that the most exciting part of home 
        church growth is now at hand--an opportunity for new workers to step forward 
        and fulfill their role in the Body of Christ. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">c. You may want to denounce an antigrowth mentality that 
        would seek its own comfort and let others remain lost by not planting.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">d. Explain the various components of the planting effort, 
        remembering how foreign some aspects might seem to those who are not accustomed 
        to growth through home church replication. We should explain that, &quot;In 
        this fellowship, we use the strategy of home church planting, in much 
        the same way as the New Testament Church did, and it has had striking 
        success...&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">e. Explain the advance of the church in light of the

            as well as classes and other activities. </font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">ii) The adjustment will be easier than they think. 
            Those who have been involved in church planting are able to point

            the new situation was fine after only a short time. Note the tendency

  <ul>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">a. The amount of outreach in each of the new home churches 
        may be reduced after division for the simple reason that there are only 
        half as many people actively witnessing. At the same time, new groups 
        often experience a higher level of motivation immediately after a planting 
        attempt. Also, habits in the area of follow-up may be slack because the 
        larger group others could take care of follow up relying on key people 
        who will not be around after the plant. Try to have the new home church 
        hit the ground running, and be sure early opportunities for follow-up 
        are not wasted. Otherwise, the church will find itself in the position 
        of being without good outreach and bridges.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">b. Cell group leaders should urge cell group members 
        to pray for continued action in the new home church. Having first-timers 
        at the first meeting of the new home church would be good for morale. 
        Watch for signs of fatigue and encourage your members not to falter just 
        before the finish line. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">c. Both partner groups in a plant should continue to 
        pray for the other group, and leaders should keep their members informed 
        about progress in their sister church.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">d</font><font size="+1">. Some home churches use the 
        last meeting of the combined home church as a special night to review 
        past blessings, to give thanks to God, and to create motivation for further 
        outreach. This is the so-called &quot;Harvest Meeting.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font size="+1">i) A good way to do this is to combine a short talk 
            by a teacher with several testimonies from members. New Christians 
            should share how they were reached by someone in the home church (this 
            stresses the importance of human agency). The teacher should point 
            out that the home wants to plant a new group so others can be reached 
            and grow. Another effective type of testimony is a worker or leader 
            who did little or nothing until the last home church division, but

            years from now this home church family will have 133 home churches 
            with 5,320 people and over 3000 new Christians!&quot;</font></p>

            contributing their shares if this goal is to be reached (Eph. 4:15,16).

            in the idea of a replicating church planting movement and that they 
            cannot make it without the workers.</font></p>

        good thing. Texts such as Mk. 10:40-44 and John 10:1-15 are very suitable 
        here. Young believers will hopefully conclude that they too are called 
        to serve and later be recognized as leaders. Call on members to show respect 
        for the new leaders just as they did for the old ones. Paul consistently 
        did this (I&nbsp;Cor.16:15-16 &amp; parallels). Some groups lay hands

<h3><font size="+1">X. Failure in Church Planting</font></h3>
</b></font> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">Regardless of how much we prepare, home church planting always 
    contains the risk of failure. This is a reasonable risk, and if you handle 
    it in a godly way, failure will do little or no harm.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">1. Attitudes</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="+1">a. The first thing to realize is that failure is not 
          the end of the world. Any time Christian workers go out to work, they 
          must realize that failure is a distinct possibility. However, the grace 
          of God enables us to face failure with courage and humility. Anyone 
          who is too ego-involved or legalistic to risk having to admit failure 
          is ill-suited to Christian work. </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">b. If our members have a naive mentality in this area 
          we should speak to it early on. Some young Christians may expect nothing 
          but success in Christian work. But why should we expect no failure in 
          Christian work, when there is virtually no other area of life or work 
          where we would expect to have no failure? For too long, workers in Xenos 
          Fellowship have experienced nothing but success. In a more realistic 
          scenario, it will sometimes be necessary to try ministry projects like 
          church planting more than once before achieving success.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">c. Discontinuing an unfruitful group should be viewed 
          as a good way to renew morale and gain confidence through reorganization 
          and retooling. It is sometimes the shortest path to fruitfulness.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">d. In cases of failure, the leadership should point 
          out certain truths to the work force of both home churches: Namely, 
          that God has not been unfaithful, nor has anything unusual or catastrophic 
          occurred. Instead, they need to understand that a Christian ministry 
          project was attempted and it failed. Anyone who has ever tried to witness 
          and had their message rejected should be able to understand failure 
          in ministry. We have no promise in Scripture of perpetual success, only 
          eventual victory. Further, the home church will now be called on to 
          bend to the task of ministry and eventually to try again!</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font size="+1">i) The immature may have certain negative tendencies 
            that need to be countered by the mature. Failure could lead to a sense 
            of guilt and failure that is unacceptable to the ego-involved and 
            the legalistic mentality. Therefore, they will seek ways of shifting 
            the burden of blame and guilt off self, and onto others. Leaders will 
            often discover feelings of hate and recriminations at such a time, 
            and should be prepared to counsel and teach the young a true attitude 
            of Christian grace. Don't underestimate the extent of temptation in 
            this area and hence relax vigilance, giving opportunity to the devil. 
            The leaders of failed home churches are particularly vulnerable to 
            accusation at this time.</font></p>

  <ul>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">a. The fact that a failure has occurred should be determined
           by the elders in consultation with the staff overseers. We should
          never 
        jump to the conclusion that a church has failed when it is only being
           tested and sifted. Such temporary reversals are to be expected as
          a normal 
        feature of Christian work. Unless we teach members to expect this beforehand,
           the work force of struggling home churches will tend to lose their
          composure 
        during times of adversity. Avoid hysteria.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">b. In this fellowship, we have a safety net of other
           home churches to fall back on in time of distress. Recombination of
          home 
        churches has proven to be an effective answer to the problem of failed
           home churches. </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="+1">i) When failure occurs, the sending, or sister, home
             church is usually responsible to help the failed church through
            recombination 
          or other acceptable means.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">ii) In most situations, the leaders will need to step
             down from leadership (but not from the Servant Team) at the time
            of 
          recombination. This is necessary in order to prevent proliferation
            of  leaders without proliferation of home churches. It will also
            help in 
          the efficiency of the newly constituted home church. Every leader should
             be willing to forsake the title of home church leader if necessary
            for 
          the benefit of the home church. </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">iii) In many cases, leadership may call for recombination
             with a home church other than the sister or sending home church
            in order 
          to better serve the strategic needs of the moment and/or to avoid problems.
             This is especially likely if the plant happened many years earlier.</font></p>

<h3><font size="+1"> Conclusion</font></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">The multiplication of home churches poses a mortal threat 
    to the kingdom of Satan. No one knows this better than the enemy himself. 
    Yet, in spite of the most vicious counterattacks, the church should be able 
    to continue to advance if careful planning and sound theory animate their 
    actions.</font></p>

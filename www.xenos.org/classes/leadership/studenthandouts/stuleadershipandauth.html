<h2><font size="+1">A unified statement of policy from the leaders at Xenos' 
  College Ministry </font></h2>

<p><font size="+1">9/20/97</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">During recent discussions with members and each other, we have
discovered confusion and possible misinterpretation of our position on leadership and
authority boundaries. To avoid further confusion and to bring glory to God, we have
consulted the elders and come together in a combined leaders' meeting to compose our
thoughts on this key subject. The elders have reviewed the paper, and have affirmed these
findings as accurately reflecting Xenos policy. This paper can be freely disseminated as
members see fit. </font></p>

<h3><font color="#000000" size="+1">What is Leadership Authority?</font></h3>

<p><font size="+1">Although the heart of leadership according to Scripture is 
  servanthood (Mark 10:42-45), the Bible also teaches that legitimate leaders 
  have authority, in the sense of a right to direct others. This authority comes 
  from God and is delegated to leaders for the good of the church. The following 
  verses reflect the clear teaching that leaders should be respected and obeyed 
  when operating within their legitimate sphere of authority: </font> 
<dl>
  <dt><font size="+1">1 Cor. 16:15-18 </font></dt>
  <dd><font size="+1">You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in
    Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints. I urge you,
    brothers, to submit to such as these and to everyone who joins in the work, and labors at
    it. . . Such men deserve recognition. </font></dd>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><font size="+1">1 Thes. 5:12,13 </font></dt>
  <dd><font size="+1">Now we ask you, brothers, to respect those who work hard among you, who
    are over you in the Lord and who admonish you. Hold them in the highest regard in love
    because of their work. Live in peace with each other.</font></dd>
  <dt>&nbsp; </dt>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><font size="+1">Titus 2:15 </font></dt>
  <dd><font size="+1">[Speaking to a leader] These, then, are the things you should 
    teach. Encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone despise 
    you. </font></dd>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><font size="+1">Heb. 13:7 </font></dt>
  <dd><font size="+1">Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the
    outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith. </font></dd>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><font size="+1">Heb. 13:17 </font></dt>
  <dd><font size="+1">Obey your leaders and submit to their authority. They keep 
    watch over you as those who must give an account. Obey them so that their 
    work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no advantage to you. 
    </font></dd>

<p><font size="+1">Dissent vs. rebellion</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="+1">In addition to these points, we would remind people of key 
  qualifications from another of the earlier elders' papers on <a href="../authority.html">authority 
  in the church</a>:</font></p>

<h3><b><font size="4">1. Leadership Accountability</font></b></h3>
<ol>
</ol>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">Delegated authority</font> </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font size="+1">Leaders are accountable</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">1&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;3; Tit.&nbsp;1</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</ol>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font size="+1">Members have recourse<br>
    </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font size="4">2. Leadership Limitations</font></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>The scope of the authority is limited to </i></font><font size="+1"><i><b> </b><strong>the
          area of the authority given to them by God.</strong></i><strong> <br>
God
          does not require us to obey delegated authorities outside the legitimate
          sphere of their authority.
    This is why wives are urged to &quot;be submissive to your <i>own</i> husbands&quot; -
    not to all men </strong>(1 Pet. 3:1; Eph. 5:22)<strong>. For the same reason,
    it is inappropriate for parents to tell their adult children whom they must
    marry, or for civil
    authorities to tell their citizens what religious beliefs they must hold,
  or for church authorities to tell Christians what jobs they may take.&quot;</strong> </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">Paul uses the family metaphor in a qualified way:</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">We notice two exceptions: 1)Paul compares himself to 
        a mother nursing and a father to the Thessalonians (1 Thess. 2:7, 11). 
        However, the similarity with mothers is the affection they have for their 
        children, and the similarity to fathers was in the way they were &quot;exhorting 
        and encouraging and imploring&quot; the Thessalonians. These actions suggest 
        pleas, not commands. 2) He calls himself the Corinthians' father (1 Cor. 
        4:15) and implies that this gives him a measure of authority, but this 
        applies only to those who were actually converted through his ministry.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">Examples of inappropriate leadership relationships:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h3><font size="+1">Sample Legitimate Uses of Home Church Leaders' Authority</font></h3>
  <ol>
    <ol>
      <li><font size="+1">Deciding how a home church will use or not use music 
        in its meetings. </font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Deciding on membership of cell groups or other study 
        groups focusing on discipleship. (But not regulating who attends public 
        meetings like home churches. Note that campus ministry home churches are 
        technically &quot;<a href="../../../admin/minteam.htm">Ministry Teams</a>&quot; 
        in Xenos, which means they do have the right to restrict attendance at 
        their meetings.) </font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Deciding who is admitted to ministry houses. (However, 
        terms for admission and removal from houses must be disclosed to prospective 
        members <i>before</i> they move in) </font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Deciding who will teach at meetings, and what will be 
        taught. </font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Deciding what ministries will be prioritized at meetings, 
        but not preventing people from practicing ministries they feel led to 
        practice. </font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Deciding when and how to apply formal church discipline. 
        (The elders insist on an opportunity to review and possibly veto any proposed 
        formal discipline involving removal from the church) </font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Deciding what standards will apply in judgment areas 
        of ministry, such as how strict or lenient to be on gray matters, or how 
        certain problems should be counseled. For instance, how soon after a serious 
      moral failure should a personal be allowed to teach? </font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Mapping out a doctrinal position on areas open to question, 
        such as the role of women in the church or social or divorce ethics (but 
        not forbidding members to hold different views in these non-essential 
        areas). </font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Recognizing or removing ministry house leaders, cell leaders, high school leaders (but get sphere leader approval for Sr. leader changes), or sit-in leaders. </font><br>

  group of students and leaders. We thank God that we have such a motivated and 
  energized group. We are not calling in this paper for a shift that would make 
  us a soft group. </font><font size="+1">We want full involvement. We want zeal. 
  We want commitment. These are the least we should offer the Lord. By making 
  sure we all have a proper understanding of church leadership and authority, 
  we believe we will sustain our zeal and commitment without stain of wrong-doing 
  or over-doing. While we may see some take advantage of the grace of God, in 
  the long run we will see deeper and more lasting results if we all accept only 
  that authority we should have in our position, and refuse any more.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In Mark 10, Jesus warns about &quot;the spirit of the Gentiles&quot; 
  who love to lord it over one another. John also rebuked &quot;Diotrephes, who 
  loves to be first among them.&quot; (3 John) We are thankful we have the kind 
  of leadership that will take positive measures to prevent these problems in 
  our church. Our leaders are our most important assets and we are glad we have 
  good ones.</font></p>

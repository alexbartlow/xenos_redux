<p><font size="+1">In the New Testament God used human leaders to bring blessing 
  and feeding to the church. From the day of Pentecost, the apostles acted as 
  <i>de facto</i> leaders. They preached, taught, (Acts 2:42) and ruled on issues 
  that came up for debate (Acts 6:1,2). They were able to ____________ leadership 
  to others(Acts 6:3,4).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">After the period of the Jerusalem church, attention shifts 
  to Paul's missionary journeys. Paul, too, was an apostle, and an obvious leader. 
  He served in Antioch with a group of men who were said to be &quot;prophets 
  and teachers.&quot; (Acts 13:1) These may have been the elders in Antioch, though 
  it never says that. It does record that &quot;they&quot; [probably the same 
  men] ______________ on Paul and Barnabas and sent them off on the first journey.&quot; 
  The reason they chose Paul and Barnabas was divine election (see below). 
  On that journey we see them appointing elders in the new churches they 
  planted. (Acts 14:23) The fasting and prayer that preceeded these appointments 
  suggests they were seeking God's choice for leaders.</font></p>
<font size="+1">During the second journey, Paul added<b> </b>Timothy to his band, 
likely leading to Timothy's eventual recognition as an apostle. Although this 
is never actually stated, Timothy acts in the role of an apostle in appointing 
elders in and overseeing elders according to 1 Timothy. (Ch. 3; 5:17ff) The only 
criteria given for why Paul chose Timothy is that &quot;The brothers at Lystra 
and Iconium &quot;spoke well of him&quot; (Acts 16:2) Paul refers to bestowing<b> 
</b>gifts on Timothy by the laying on of his own hands<b> </b>(most likely the 
gift of apostleship). This is also referred to in 1 Tim. 4:14 where Paul reminds 
him of his gift, &quot;which was bestowed upon you through prophetic utterance 
with the laying on of hands by the presbytery.&quot; Thus, if a prophetic utterance 
was the occasion of Timothy's choosing, we again have a case of <b>_______________.</b></font> 
<p><font size="+1">Both Timothy and Titus are given the job of appointing elders. 
  Of interest is the fact that Paul has left them behind to do this work, implying 
  that it was _______________ to select elders when he was there. This suggests 
  that they wanted to see these men<b> </b>actually<b> </b>living out<b> </b>leadership 
  roles<b> </b>before making the choice to recognize them as elders. Likewise, 
  Paul cautions Timothy about deacons: &quot;They must first be tested; and then 
  if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons.&quot; (1 Tim. 3:10)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Overarching these observations about leadership in the early 
  church, we see other evidence of divine election in the selection of leaders. 
  This should be clear for the following reasons.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Even with these principles, the business of determining God's 
  calling remains subjective. We are often reduced to guesswork<b> </b> when 
  naming leaders, because there are<b> </b>so many<b> </b>variables<b>.</b> We 
  usually are faced with compromise in at least some areas with every leader we 
  recognize.</font><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="+1"></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Even churches that work toward installing only leaders<b> </b>chosen 
  and manifested<b> </b>by God will sometimes find they have leaders who don't<b> 
  </b>belong<b>.</b> These are usually painful situations that call for grace 
  and firmness. Certainly every church would hope to keep such situations to a<b> 
  </b>minimum<b>.</b> Ideally, we should have all our leaders <b>actually functioning </b> 
  as leaders, all belonging in their roles because God himself has chosen to put 
  them there. Realistically, this will<b> </b>not be the case, because even some 
  who were chosen to be leaders at one time, later act in such a way to discredit 
  themselves, or for other reasons are no longer able to serve (e.g. Paul and 
  Barnabas sent away from Antioch). Therefore, this issue becomes<b> </b>a perpetual 
  area of<b> </b>tension in the church as new leaders are considered, and older 
  leaders are reconsidered. Our best move is to follow principles calculated to 
  maximize the likelihood of chosen leaders holding authority so we have a God-made, 
  not a man-made leadership in the church.</font></p>

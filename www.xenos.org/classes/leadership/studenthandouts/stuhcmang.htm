    <blockquote>&nbsp;</blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1"><b>Assigning follow-up</b>- </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">1. The person who <b>brought</b> a new member to the 
      home church should have the first opportunity to disciple that member 
      (see II Cor. 10:13-16; II Tim. 2:6). Exceptions to this rule of thumb 
      would be: </font></p>
    <blockquote><blockquote> 
        <p><font size="+1">a) cases where the original outreacher is of the opposite 
          sex. <br>
          <br>
          Also, in cases of cross-gender outreach, candidates 
          to follow the person up should normally be limited to members of the 
          cell group directly related to the bringer's group. In other words, 
          when a new home church is planted, they should end up in the same home 
          church. You should not violate this principle without good reason.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">b) cases where the original outreacher is <b>too young</b> 
          in the Lord to have a teaching ministry, (although in this case he/she 
          should be invited to help disciple the new one in a cell group). Remember, 
          in the early church, people commonly became leaders during their first 
          year in the Lord. Avoid over-qualifying people for ministry! Of course 
          you might be able to do a better job, but ministry is a powerful motivation 
          for growth. Because ministry is a means of growth, it will help immature 
          members to <b>overcome sin problems</b> that may hold them back otherwise. 
          If the bar is too high for getting involved in ministry, the morale 
          in your group will suffer.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">c) cases where the outreaching one has character flaws 
          so serious that they absolutely disqualify him/her from Christian work. 
          These flaws should be objective, <b>serious</b>, and recent. Again, 
          remember that ministry is a means of growth, and people may need responsibility 
          to help them overcome their bad habits.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">d) when the outreacher doesn't want to disciple the 
          new person, or fails to do so even after repeated reminders. New people 
          should not have to pay the price for sins of omission committed by our 
          established members. A <b>warning</b> is usually in order before by-passing 
          such an omitter.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">e) when the new person <b>refuses to accept</b> the 
          leadership of the one who brought him/her, then this principle may also 
          be nullified. However, effort should be made to persuade the new 
          one to follow the outreacher.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">f) in <b>rare</b> cases where one cell group has been 
          overwhelmed with new people because of a powerful evangelist or a people 
          movement, they may plead for help from other cells. This should be the 
          decision of the <b>overwhelmed group</b>, not a move that is imposed 
          on them. The norm should be that even large numbers won in such situations 
          remain in the same cells together.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">g) in student groups, <b>incoming students</b> from 
          younger ministries (high school to college, etc.) are often unconnected, 
          but not if workers in the older group were responsible for recruiting 
          the new members (e.g. a college member has been working with the high 
          schooler in a college-led high school group.)</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">h) <b>transfers</b> from other Xenos home churches, 
          recombinations, or <b>referrals</b> from Home Group Connection are typically available 
          to all.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">NOTE: It is very <b>dangerous</b> and <b>wrong</b> 
          to nullify the principle of allowing the outreacher to work with the 
          new person without just cause. The effect can be loss of motivation 
          in the work force, distrust of leaders, division, and faulty leadership 
          selection.</font></p>
      </blockquote>

    <p><font size="+1">2. Those leaders or workers who have a proven record of 
      delivering competent, devoted home church leaders should be allowed to work 
      with some promising young believers if possible. </font> </p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">3. People who need to be followed-up by someone other than 
      the one who brought them are considered &quot;<b>neutral</b>&quot; first 
      timers, and should be followed up by someone else. In the case of neutral 
      first timers, the decision on who should disciple them can be affected by 
      the following considerations: </font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">a) The one who originally followed the new person up 
        effectively might be a reasonable choice to disciple, unless there are 
        reasons why he/she should not. For instance, some people always quickly 
        move to spend time with new people, but may not follow through as well.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">b) Follow the principle of &quot;<b>finishing old business</b> 
        before going <b>on to new</b>.&quot; We should resist the tendency of 
        some leaders and workers to jump from person to person. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        In cases where workers plead they need someone new to work with because 
        they have <b>failed</b> with their former person, the following questions 
        should be resolved. </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="+1">(1) What <b>lessons</b> were <b>learned</b>?</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">(2) Was the failure <b>legitimate</b>, or the result 
          of negligence, over-aggressiveness, or other errors? </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">(3) Note the tendency of some workers to attribute 
          failures to the fact that the new person was &quot;<b>a bad apple</b>.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          These issues should be discussed at the home church <b>leaders' meeting</b> 
          before a neutral first timer is given into the care of the one who failed. 
          Be merciful, but firm in these discussions.<br>
          <br>
        </font></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">Since any assignment to follow someone up will be <b>respected</b> 
      from that time on, and will not likely be <b>changed</b> in the future, 
      these are rather big decisions. <br>

              of the home church are divided as evenly as possible, hopefully along
              existing lines of influence in the home church. For instance, if you
              have two couples leading together, each couple takes their disciples
              and related friends, groups, ministry houses, and guests, and adds
              new leadership as needed before parting ways.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">b) This model promotes equality between the groups in
              terms of experience. The conventional model seems to also offer a sense
              of continuity to the people in that they have some of the same leaders
              to look to, and usually they have their friends with them as well.
              The results have, so far, been good. To date, the conventional model
              remains the most successful model in use.</font></p>

            <p><font size="+1">a) Unless they are careful, the home church leaders
              could suffer major disruption of their long-standing relationships
              when planting this way. After working together with a team for years,
              separating from them could be difficult for some leaders. In-depth
              relationships and spiritual community support are just as important
              for leaders as for non-leaders. Further, while suffering for the sake
              of the gospel is reasonable and biblical, we don't want leaders to
              become aversive to further church planting attempts, or to lose effectiveness
              because of depression.<br>
                    <br>
              To avoid such hazards, leaders in a conventional church plant should
              plan ahead carefully. The leaders need to build deeply into relationships
              with others (usually their disciples) who will accompany them in the
              new church, because they won't have their former fellow-leaders with
              them any more. If we build ministry spheres, and whole cell groups are
              sent out together, people should already have good relationships in the
              new group.</font></p>

            <p><font size="+1">a) After the leaders decide how they will plant the
              group, go over your plans with the rest of the home church members
              to make sure they agree to go to the side you envision for them. In
              the case of those not in a cell group, you may need to discuss their
              options one-on-one. Be sure everyone decides which side they will attend
              before the actual plant to avoid a lopsided division or &quot;church-tasting.&quot; A
              taste-test approach could amount to a popularity contest, which would
              be unedifying. <br>
                    <br>
              We think people should be taught that an important basis for deciding
              where to go is where they can be used by God the most--that is, where
              they are needed. Other criteria could include relational history and
              ministry investment. Remember, however, we can't replicate churches and
              at the same time stay with everything and everyone with whom we have
              invested. In cases where ministry spheres are clearly defined everyone
              will know where they belong and little needs to be said. Normally, the
              church plant should be known to all for months in advance, if not a year
              or more. But we should never try to compel people to go to a particular
              home church against their will.</font></p>

<h3><font size="4"><b>III. The Mission Church Model</b></font></h3>

  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="+1">1. Definition </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="+1">a. In the Mission Church model, the leaders of the original
                home church stay together, while sending out an all-new leadership
              team with their own home church.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">b. In theory this model has much to commend it, because
                the new leaders get the opportunity to take the next step in ministry
                maturity-- taking responsibility for their own home church. This is
                an opportunity and a challenge that sometimes results in unexpected
                progress in the lives of the new leaders. This experience sometimes
                bears out the theory that some people won't learn to swim until the
                water gets too deep for wading.<br>
                    <br>
              On the other hand, be sure the new leaders actually have the ministry
              power to do the job. To date, the mission model has been problematic,
              resulting in a somewhat higher proportion of failures, so try to be sure
              the new leaders are ready. Your home group sphere leader and the elders
              must agree that your mission church is sufficiently experienced and trained
              to make success plausible.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">Also, the new church should plan on remaining in a mentoring
                relationship with the parent church for a period of months (3 to 6
                months or more is typical). The parent church, in consultation with
                their oversight leaders, should decide when they are no longer needed.
                One method for insuring adequate supervision is to alternate between
                separate home church leaders meetings and joint home church leaders'
                meetings for a period of time after the plant. Finally, if the mission
                church looks shakey, sphere leaders may call on the planting church
                to &quot;warrant&quot; the new plant. If it later fails, the sending
                church would be obligated to receive them back, so planting a failing
              church is a major waste of time and effort.</font></p>

        <ul>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="+1">a. The size of the mission church should be adequate.
                In most cases, this means the actual attendance at the new church (rather
                than the list of members) should usually be in the upper teens or higher
                if a student or singles' group, and over twelve if middle-aged. In
                general, small churches are vulnerable to demoralization during times
                when a proportion of their membership are missing for vacations etc.
                or some members are lost. People may feel like the extremely small
                size of the group signals failure, and may lose confidence. Let the
                mission group have the larger numbers. The experienced side is far
              less likely to fail, and therefore can be smaller.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">An exception to this would be cases where ad-hoc Bible
                studies have been started by members in the sending church, and growth
                has justified planting them off as a new home church. Such groups may
              be quite small.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">b. The new (mission) leaders should already have their
                own cell groups before the planting attempt occurs, and the people
                in those cells should have demonstrated real life-changing growth before
                the planting attempt. This is the best proof of readiness on the part
                of the new leaders. Be sure each cell group has &quot;top-end&quot; and &quot;low-end&quot; potential
              (i.e. potential future leaders, and potential outreach to new people).</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">c. Try to build a &quot;church within a church,&quot; in
                the sense that all of the functions of home church life and growth
                are evident within the sphere of the new leaders before the planting
                attempt. In this way the leadership can determine that the new leaders
                are sufficiently mature and experienced in Christian work to succeed
                in their own home church. Also, the new home church will already have
                a structural and relational basis for carrying on its ministry with
              a minimum of disruption. </font></p>

            <p><font size="+1">a. The new leadership should have been sitting in on
                leader's meetings for at least a period of months learning how to lead
                a home church, how to think about ministry, and how to relate to other
              leaders. </font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">b. In addition, try having the new team meet with each
                other separate from the old leaders periodically. This enables them
                to get used to taking initiative and working with each other without
                help. They should evaluate their own ministry sphere, and determine
                what action to take in various ministry situations. Then, they can
                report to the old leaders on their conclusions. This should provide
                an opportunity for a fairly realistic look at the ministry dynamic
                in the mission church before actually taking the risk involved in planting.<br>
                    <br>
              </font><font size="+1">When the new leaders report on their ministry
                  decisions they should also explain their thinking. In cases where judgment
                  is involved, encourage the new leaders to implement their own decisions,
                  and note the outcome. The older leaders should only overrule the new
                  leaders' judgment in cases where they see clear evidence that serious
                  damage might result. Until we can trust the ministry judgment of the
                  new leaders, we can't really have confidence in their ability to lead
                a new church.</font></p>

            <p><font size="+1">a. In some cases, you can cooperate with another home
                church to produce a new home church. This is the so-called &quot;Three
                for Two&quot; planting attempt. This is to be distinguished from a
                reorganization, which may involve more than one church, but does not
                result in an actual gain in numbers of home churches. We have also
                seen 4 for 3 or 5 for 4 arrangements, especially when opening up a
                new geographical area or special field (age group, special affinities,
              etc.). </font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">b. In most situations, a &quot;three for two&quot; planting
                attempt is the result of an inequity in growth, either at the upper,
                or lower end. In other words, a home church may have grown in terms
                of numbers without having raised up adequate leadership (excessive
                low-end growth) or has developed leaders without having grown very
                much in numbers (excessive high-end growth). Both of these situations

                    only&quot; church, why has the church increased in numbers but
                    not in leaders? Has there been an activistic focus that might result
                    in a superficial understanding of community and maturity (i.e.
                    evangelism is the only thing that matters)? If so, such a group
                    needs to grow up into the fullness of Christ, and build real depth,
                    or they will always need to depend on others to supply their leadership.
                    The leadership, in consultation with their supervision, need to
                    determine whether it might be better to wait in a no-growth situation,
                  using the crowding as incentive to complete the work of discipleship.</font></p>
                <p><font size="+1">ii) In the case of the &quot;top-end only&quot; church,
                    a different question arises. Namely, if the leaders are so mature
                    and numerous, why is no one interested in listening to their message?
                    Are there moral or ideological problems (such as an unbalanced
                    tribalism or search theology) which will make them ill-suited to
                    lead a group of new Christians? Is their concept of maturity limited
                    to a &quot;Bible club&quot; mentality? Generally, if a home church
                    needs more members, the first place to seek them is in the world,
                    not from another church! <br>
                    <br>
                  These are the painful questions that have to be asked and resolved
                  in the case of a &quot;three for two&quot; church planting arrangement.
                    In cases where they can be resolved, the &quot;three for two&quot; model
                    has proven to be a successful model, answering many of the needs
                    for sharing resources. Upper level leaders, like the elders, Pastoral,
                    Student Ministries, or Adult Ministries staffers should get involved

          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="+1">a. The <b>elders or other overseers should be approached
                first</b> with a proposal, or with a request for help. The home church
                leaders must demonstrate 1) real need or opportunity, 2) that the
                people they propose to send include good workers and members, and
                3) that only a reasonable number of marginally involved people are
              being sent to join the new group.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">b. Your sphere leader will undertake a search for a
                suitable home church before that home church's leaders are approached.
                This is to prevent friction between home churches as well as wasted
                time. It is not our policy to have home churches canvassing the fellowship
                for &quot;three for two&quot; arrangements, as this would waste much
                time, and cause unnecessary stress on the part of home church leaders.
                Besides, one home church is rarely in a position to assess what is
              happening in another, still less the overall needs of the fellowship. </font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">c. If the supervisory staff find a possible home church
                partner, the initiating home church leaders or sphere leader should
                approach the other home church leaders only in confidential discussion.
                They should carefully avoid the appearance of applying pressure to
                the other leaders by agitating the members of the other home church.
              If the proposed partner church is interested, negotiations can begin.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">d. The elders or supervisory staff should be informed
                of the outcome of the negotiations. When everyone agrees, the workers
                and members of the home churches should be approached. All who join
                the planting attempt must agree freely to go. Leaders should avoid
                compelling or pressuring people to go on the planting attempt. We may
              plead and persuade, but not pressure.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">e. Before the plant, make sure the people from both
                sides who will be in the new group meet with each other socially and
                in other ways, so the first meeting of the new church is not the first
              time they meet each other. Try to build community before going out.</font></p>

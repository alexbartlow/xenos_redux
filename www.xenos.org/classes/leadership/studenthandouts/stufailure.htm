<p><font size="4">The biggest problem with many of us in Xenos is that we are 
  soft from<i> too much success</i>. We are like a child riding a bike on training 
  wheels who thinks he has actually learned to ride. His parents warn him, "It’s 
  a little harder when you take the wheels off," but until you actually do take 
  them off, the kid continues to enjoy a false sense of mastery. Once the wheels 
  come off, the child may have to endure a few nasty crackups that could lead 
  to tears, and even a refusal to ride any more. But without removing the wheels, 
  he will never learn to ride.</font></p>
</font> 
<p><font size="4">In our training, failure has played a prominent role, and in 
  fact a crucial role that success never could have played. We have failed at 
  more ministry attempts than most in our church have ever tried! Bible studies, 
  personal evangelism, discipleship, and overall fellowship direction are all 
  venues where we have tasted deeply of failure, often with embarrassment and 
  disgrace. While we still don’t like to fail, we increasingly realize that nothing 
  teaches us more than our failures.</font></p>

<p><font size=4>Leaders thus broken through failure become suitable tools in the hands of the 
  Lord. But unbroken leaders pose a threat to the health and spirituality of the 
  church. Leaders accustomed to nothing but success become, themselves, hard to 
  lead. They are always convinced they are right, and will fight to preserve their 
  base as though their self-worth depended on it, which it often does. In their 
  dread of failure, they may become downright unethical and manipulative. They find 
  it hard to listen to the wisdom of others because they can’t help but observe 
  that their own ideas seem to be working perfectly well. Such unbroken leaders 
  not only fear failure in themselves, but also in others. They may become unwilling 
  to let others have the chance to fail, and this leads to poor delegation in discipleship. 
  When success becomes the be-all and end-all in ministry, it is an idol that God 
  must throw down. Note that failure may come in an area other than our main ministry, 
but it will surely come. </font></p>
<p><font size="4">Note that super-spiritual believers have particular problems
    with failure. Their theology assumes that such things shouldn't happen if
    the leader is truly spirit-filled. When failure comes the leader is likely
    to lose composure, and their following (who have been taught super-spiritual
    principles) are likely to reject them because they don't have God on their
    side (or some formula along these lines).</font></p>
<font size=4>
<p>Nothing would advance most of us more than getting some good failure under 
  our belts! It isn't that bad once you get used to it, and the fruit over the 
  long haul is well worth the pain. Consider how fear of failure can affect the 
  church:</p>
<dir> 
  <dir> 
    <ol>
      <li><br>
        <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>If you suffer from fear of failure, ask yourself, &quot;What is the worst thing 
  that could happen to me if I fail?" Does failure in ministry really endanger 
  our lives, or only our egos? The ego-centered minister dreads failure mainly 
  because he will have to admit it to colleagues or others he hopes to impress. 
  Just imagining himself admitting defeat can send the ego-driven leader into 
  a panic of self-protection. But God has called us to deny self and serve in 
  ministry, not to be glorified by it. Mentally practice shrugging your shoulders 
  before colleagues and saying, "Yeah, that didn’t work out, but at least we tried" 
  and don’t forget to add, "I guess we’d better try again!" The only defense you 
  need is, "I felt like I did my best."</p>

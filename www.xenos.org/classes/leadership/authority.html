    <p><font size="+1">Rom. 13:2</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h5><font size="+1">Three limiting features for delegated authorities: </font></h5>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">- <i>The scope of the authority is limited to the area
          of authority assigned to them by God.</i> This is why wives are urged
          to &quot;be submissive to your <i>own</i> husbands&quot; - not to all
          men (1Pet. 3:1; Eph. 5:22). For the same reason, parents should not
          tell their adult children who they must marry, nor can civil authorities
          tell their citizens what religious beliefs they must hold. Likewise,
          church leaders should not tell Christians what jobs they may take,
          how to spend their money, who to date, or other issues unrelated to
          running the church.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">- <i>Human authority should never be autonomous.</i> All
        leaders should be under God's authority. This is why when scripture addresses
        those under delegated authority, it usually also addresses those in authority
        in the same passage and reminds them of their responsibilities before
        God. This is also why we should disobey delegated authorities whenever
        they tell us to do something contrary to God's will (Acts 4:19,20; 5:29).</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">- <i>God's design for leadership is to serve (Mk.&nbsp;10:41-
          45; Rom.&nbsp;13:4).</i> Even though God often permits wicked people
          to hold positions of authority, the scripture condemns the abuse of
          that authority for the purpose of exploitation or oppression, and God
          will personally call them to account for their actions.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3><font size="+1">Actions &amp; attitudes for those under authority</font></h3>
  <ol type="A">
    <ol>
      <li><font size="+1" face="Times">Believers should have an attitude of respect
          and the inclination to follow their leaders (Heb. 13:17).</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Following should be active--not passive. We should
          seek out leadership, and find ways to help them succeed in accomplishing
          legitimate goals.</font> </li>
      <li><font face="Times" size="+1">Whenever possible, we should be sure that
          we understand why leaders are asking us to do something. This is important
          because such understanding enables us to follow their instructions
          more enthusiastically, and to do so out of genuine obedience to God
          (see Eph. 6:5,7; Col. 3:22,23 - &quot;as to the Lord&quot; has this
          meaning).</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times" size="+1">The burden of proof is on those under
          authority to justify why they should not follow, not vice-versa.</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1" face="Times">When we cannot obey a leader's directive
          for reasons of conscience, we should seek a constructive alternative
          that will fulfill leaders' desires as much as possible, and also enable
          us to obey God (see Dan. 1:8-16 for an example of this). In this spirit,
          we can and should ask questions, make suggestions, and even raise objections,
          but with a respectful demeanor.</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1" face="Times">When we find it necessary to disobey a
          leader, we should do so respectfully, not rebelliously or maliciously.
          We should explain our reasons (see Acts&nbsp;4:19,20; 5:29). In most
          ongoing relationships, especially in the church, we should have the
          courage to declare our intention to disobey.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times" size="+1">Within the church, dissent is different
          than rebellion or disobedience. We may disagree with delegated authorities
          over issues, and we are free to express that disagreement as long as
          we handle the disagreement properly. Most areas of disagreement are
          so minor that we can simply go along with those who lead. Some issues,
          however, are important enough that our conscience requires that we
          take further measures. In these cases, the first thing to do would
          be to talk about the issue with those in leadership. </font>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font face="Times" size="+1">Perhaps we will persuade our leaders
                that our viewpoint is correct, or perhaps they will persuade
                us. Either of these results would end the dissent. If the disagreement
                is not resolved, we should decide how important the issue is. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times" size="+1">If we think the issue is important
                and we may be disobeying God or our conscience to follow the
                leadership, we should either: </font></p>
            <ul>
              <li><font face="Times" size="+1">Inform the leadership that we
                  will be unable to obey and ask what they want to do, or </font></li>
              <li><font face="Times" size="+1">Inform higher leadership (i.e.
                  sphere leaders) of your dilemma and appeal for intervention
                  (note, your leaders should have no objection to your going
                  to higher authority, like sphere leaders, with an appeal),
                  or </font></li>
              <li><font face="Times" size="+1">Leave the group and find leadership
                  we can follow, making clear to the old leadership what our
                  reasons are for withdrawing.</font></li>
            </ul>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times" size="+1">If we decide the issue is not important
              enough to violate our conscience, we should be able to serve with
              a good attitude toward the leadership, though in disagreement in
              a specific issue.</font></p>
      </li>
      <li><font size="+1" face="Times">We could possibly find ourselves unable
          to agree with the leadership on a fairly important point, but not so
          important that we feel we should leave the church. In this case, we
          may declare ourselves to be loyal dissenters. A loyal dissenter is
          unwilling to remain quiet about his dissent, but also unwilling to
          leave. Such a posture is permissible, but often questionable. Such
          dissenters need to exercise special care to avoid division in the church.
          Their dissent must be shared only in helpful ways, and qualified carefully.
          They must take care to avoid portraying other's positions unfairly
          or leaving out important material. Leaders may call on dissenters to
          restrict their dissent in various ways for the sake of unity and reducing
          confusion. (For instance, why share your area of disagreement with
          new people who are still trying to understand the basics?)</font></li>

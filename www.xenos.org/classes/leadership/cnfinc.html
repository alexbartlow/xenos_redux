    <p><font size="+1">2. Money should be handled in such a way that is defensible 
      against any accusation (2&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;8:21).</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">3. Money stewards should be trustworthy people. More than 
      one person should perform every function so that we have accountability 
      (2&nbsp;Cor. 8:18-24; Acts&nbsp;6:3-6).</font></p>
  </dir>

<font size="4"><b> 
<p><font size="+1">How the church should collect its money </font> 
</b></font> 
<dir> 
  <dir> 
    <p><font size="+1">1. It should not demand that its people tithe. The tithe 
      was a tax levied on Israelites which supported the Levites. There is no 
      evidence that it was prescribed for Christians. However, it is not wrong 
      to suggest ten per cent as a rule of thumb for what consistent and significant 
      giving means. We would also hope that because grace produces a righteousness 
      superior to that produced by law, giving under grace will also exceed giving 
      mandated by law.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">2. Collections should be done with sensitivity to the non-Christian 
      (2&nbsp;Cor. 2:17; 2&nbsp;Thes. 3:7-9; 1&nbsp;Cor. 9:12). NonChristians 
      are often suspicious about collections because of the existence of so many 
      religious charlatans and hucksters. When collections are taken with nonChristians 
      present, we should make it clear that giving is an opportunity for Christians 
      to thank and serve God, and that we do not want our guests to feel obligated 
      in any way to give. We should also periodically publicly articulate key 
      <a href="../../aboutxenos/strange.htm#elderlimit">Xenos financial policies</a> 
      designed to decrease suspicion. At the same time, we should be frank unapologetic 
      with nonChristian guests that giving is an important part of Christian living.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">3. Collections should be done in a regular and orderly 
      manner (1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;16:1-3). We should facilitate consistent individual 
      giving by reminding members in a variety of ways, including taking collections 
      on a regular basis. We should view this as no different than calls to pray 
      or witness.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">4. The church should teach Christians the many biblical 
      reasons for giving. These reasons include:</font> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">a.<i> Out of gratitude for what God has given us through 
        Christ.</i> The image of giving ourselves as a thank-offering in response 
        to God's grace is cited in Rom.&nbsp;12:1. Notice that this same image 
        is applied specifically to giving money to support God's work in Phil.&nbsp;4:18. 
        This seems to be the primary motivation taught in the Bible.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">b.<font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman"> </font><i>To 
        meet real needs in the name of Christ.</i> In Phil.&nbsp;4:16, Paul says 
        that their financial giving to his missionary work has met his needs. 
        Similarly, in 2&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;9:12, Paul says that the Corinthians' financial 
        giving was &quot;fully supplying the needs of the saints.&quot; In a very 
        real way, God transmutes the money that we give to the church into ministry 
        which meets peoples needs. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">c.<i> To experience eternal reward. </i>In<i> </i>Phil. 
        4:17, Paul says he wants them to give, not simply so that he may receive 
        their money, but so that they experience &quot;profit in their account.&quot; 
        This probably refers to the reward that they will receive at the judgment-seat 
        of Christ, when he evaluates our service for him as Christians (1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;3:10-15). 
        In a very real way, we are making an investment in our own eternal futures 
        when we give our money to God's work. This is one very practical way to 
        &quot;lay up treasure in heaven&quot; (Matt.&nbsp;6:20).</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">d.<i> As a way of experiencing God's faithfulness to 
        provide for our material needs.</i> Phil.&nbsp;4:19 makes the promise 
        that as we give to support God's work, he will care for our material needs. 
        Many passages teach this (Matt.&nbsp;6:33; 2&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;9:8,10). God 
        invites us to learn experientially about this exciting aspect of his loving 
        care for us as we give in this way. Stated differently, it is not possible 
        to say that we are trusting God with our finances unless we are giving 
        significantly and consistently of our money to his work.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">e.<i> To increase our commitment to God.</i> In Lk.&nbsp;12:33,34, 
        Jesus urges us to give of our money to help the poor because &quot;where 
        your treasure is, there will your heart be also.&quot; This passage is 
        not saying that our giving is an index of our commitment (though this 
        is often true), but rather that our giving affects our level of interest 
        and commitment to God. If we invest in stocks, our interest in, and commitment 
        to, that company will increase. The more we invest in God's work, the 
        more our interest in and commitment to God will increase.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">f.<i> To be morally responsible.</i> Several passages 
        teach that because we receive spiritual benefit from God's servants, we 
        are responsible to minister to their material needs. Rom.&nbsp;15:27 teaches 
        this principle and applies it extra-locally (Gentile Christians should 
        acknowledge their spiritual &quot;debt&quot; to Jewish Christians); Gal.&nbsp;6:6 
        applies it locally (those taught should share materially with those who 
        teach). 1&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;5:17,18 applies it to elders. 1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;9:4-11 
        applies it to paying apostles. Many of us have wrongly dichotomized the 
        idea of grace-motivation with this complementary truth that such giving 
        is a moral obligation. Certainly, we should be able to render to God what 
        is his, and do it with an attitude of thanksgiving because he is so good 
        to us (2 Cor. 8:9 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that 
        though He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, that you through 
        His poverty might become rich.).</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">g. <i>To prevent our mission from failing</i>. Our history 
        as a church shows that all our efforts can be blocked completely by widespread 
        failure to give sacrificially. Every ministry needs funding, and We are 
        no different. In this connection, we should take notice of members who 
        give, but only to ministries other than Xenos. This unusual, but known 
        practice clearly suggests lack of confidence in our ministry, or possible 
        hostility and disunity, which needs to be resolved.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">h</font><font size="+1">. <i>To avoid having God remove 
        us from ministry</i>. Jesus said if we can't be trusted in the use of 
        a little thing like money, who will trust us with the true riches of the 
        kingdom of God? (Luke 16) According to this passage, unless we become 
        faithful stewards, God will not trust us with leadership in the church.</font></p>

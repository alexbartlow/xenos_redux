  <b><i><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">[Home churches are the most common type of home fellowship
  group in Xenos. Xenos home churches are communities of 20 to 60 men and women
  meeting weekly or biweekly for Scripture study, worship, body-life, and evangelism.
  Home churches operate like small, self-replicating churches, doing their own
  evangelism, counseling, pastoring their own members, and raising up their own
  leaders. Within each home church there are typically cell groups, made up of
  either men or women only, and meeting for the purpose of discipleship. These
  cell groups may meet weekly or biweekly. Thus, with the Central Meetings, Xenos
  has a three-level organization,
  rather than two levels, like most churches.]</font></i></b></div>
<h3><font size="+1"><b>I. General Conditions</b></font></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">When leading a new home church, your first order of business 
    is to see that your group has what we defined in an <a href="dupmod.html">earlier 
    paper</a> as &quot;low end&quot; work (that is, effective evangelism and follow-up). 
    In my opinion, a group without evangelism and follow-up will not gain spiritual 
    health no matter what other measures they take. When leaders try to improve 
    the situation through reorganizations, fussing over details, or changes in 
    meeting format, we refer to such work as &quot;chrome polishing.&quot; Chrome 
    polishing is when sailors busy themselves polishing the fixtures on a ship 
    that is sinking from a big hole in the hull. They should be focused on fixing 
    the hole and nothing else. So focus on low end work first unless you know 
    you already have that. Study the papers, <a href="evgcon.html">Leading Home 
    Church Evangelism</a> and <a href="fulead.htm">Leading Home Church Follow 
    Up</a> to get ideas for enhancing low end work in your group. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">We are also assuming that you have a relatively normal and 
    healthy home church. If, on the other hand, the home church is exceptional 
    in any of several ways, you may need a different approach to leadership than 
  what we advance here.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><font size="+1">II. A Plan of Action</font></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">Once these assumptions apply, you need a way to proceed, 
    a vision for the future, and an overall plan the leaders can agree on. Such 
    a plan should: </font></p>
  <ol>
    <ol>
      <li><font size="+1">Provide structures for all the biblical <a href="../und_min.htm">functions 
        of the church</a> including Evangelism (local and world), Koinonea, Worship, 
        Prayer, Discipleship, and Ministry to the Poor. <br>
        <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">People in your church should be able to discover and 
        enhance their spiritual gifts, developing ministries at the maximum level 
        of training and effectiveness. As leaders, you are responsible to equip 
        your people for ministry, and to facilitate each member's effort to develop 
        ministry.<br>
        <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Your church should prepare to reproduce itself. In order 
        to replicate your church you will need to duplicate all aspects of a healthy 
        Christian community. The planning for replication should begin <i>on the 
        first week</i> of your new home church.<br>
        </font></li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <p><font size="+1">The basic theory underlying a home church plan of action 
    comes from the passages referring to &quot;. . . the whole body, being fitted 
    and held together by that which every joint supplies, according to the proper 
    working of each individual part. . . .&quot; According to this verse, in an 
    ideal situation, if any member in your church fails to develop ministry, that 
    should be their decision, not the result of inadequate provision by the church. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">A final consideration in the formation of an effective plan 
    is prioritization. The limited ministry strength of the home church should 
    be directed where it can do the most good. It should not be squandered on 
    work that is unimportant or unlikely to succeed. Therefore, we need to not 
    only say &quot;yes&quot; but &quot;no&quot; to ministry opportunities. Some 
    jobs, of course, must be done even though they may seem neither important 
    nor strategic.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font size="4"> 
<p><font size="+1"><b>III. Assessing Your Group</b></font></p>
</font> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">Before you can determine a direction for the church, you 
    should arrive at a consensus regarding the overall state of the church in 
    several different areas. In Xenos, you receive several helps in assessing 
    your home church.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">A. From the office you can get <a href="3partcharts.htm">&quot;3-part 
      charts&quot;</a> of your home church, or you can create your own. These 
      are helpful diagnostic tools in determining your progress in several areas. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1"> B. To help the leaders develop such a consensus, see the 
      paper <a href="hceval.htm">&quot;Home Church Evaluation&quot;</a>. This 
      paper asks needed questions in each area of the home church's ministry, 
      and will help you think strategically about your group. <br>
      <br>
      C. In addition, each home church receives oversight calls from upper level 
      leadership every month or two. The purpose of these calls is to review the 
      thinking of the home church leaders in these areas, to make sure that you 
      have a plan, and that your plan is realistic. The calls will help refresh 
      your perspective on the group, so please cooperate. Try to have questions 
      ready, so you can get the opinion of the experienced outsider on key issues 
      you are facing. Staff helpers also try to visit every home church meeting 
      once a year or more.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1"> As can be seen in the &quot;Home Church Evaluation&quot; 
      paper, the areas that need to be considered are: </font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">1. Outreach and Follow up</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">2. Present Leadership</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">3. Quality of Body Life</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">4. Prayer</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">4. The Home Church Meeting Itself</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">5. Leadership Training</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">6. Giving</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">D. You should also define the present state of ministry 
      in home church by drawing a ministry chart. A ministry chart is a tool that 
      helps the leaders to visualize what is actually happening in the home church. 
      </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="+1"><img src="../../graphics/mincht.gif" alt="MINCHT.gif (4402 bytes)" width="600" height="367"></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">1. The boxes represent cell groups.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="+1">2. The names above the boxes are the leader(s) of the cell 
      beneath their name. </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">3. The solid line beneath the cell boxes is for names of 
      those who are not involved in cell groups, but who have attended home church 
      twice or more. These are the people being reached by each cell, and are 
      divided accordingly.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">4</font><font size="+1">. The second solid line beneath 
      the cell boxes is the &quot;deep fringe.&quot; This line contains names 
      of those who have come to social events, or CT, or Home Church once, but 
      not yet twice, or have not been assigned to a cell group for follow up. 
      Use this line to keep track of outreach work.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">5. If you draw a third line, it is for very deep fringe, 
      or prospects. Names on this line are being witnessed to and prayed for, 
      but have not yet attended anything. Churches with slow outreach should follow 
      progress on this line.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">6. Using this kind of ministry chart, it should be clear 
      how the spheres of ministry are developing within the home church. Some 
      people add lines connecting individuals to those they are discipling.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">7. In the chart above, it seems clear the home church is 
      approaching the time to plant a new home church. Already the group has four 
      cell groups. These would be arranged on either side, in a way that makes 
      the eventual church plant obvious. This kind of chart makes it easy to recognize 
      the implications of marriages or other relational bonds that may begin to 
      contradict the way the ministry is developing. Don't wait until the plant 
      to correct such contradictions.</font></p>

<h3><font size="+1">IV. Individual Multiplication</font></h3>
</font></b></font> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"> The difference between merely warehousing people and true 
    healthy home church growth is individual multiplication. At Xenos, we believe 
    in fostering a true, self-replicating church planting movement. The basis 
    of such a movement is personal discipleship resulting in the more mature members 
    of the church delivering new leaders and role models who can lead a new home 
    church. This is the goal Paul was referring to when he said, &quot;And we 
    proclaim Him, admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom, 
    that we may present every man complete in Christ.&quot; Col. 1:28. We believe 
    this is also what Christ called us to when he said to make disciples, &quot;teaching 
    them to do all that I commanded you.&quot; Mat. 28:19,20 We also see a direct 
    connection with Paul's call on church leaders to equip the saints. Eph. 4:11ff 
    </font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1"> As leaders of a home group, your task is to oversee and 
    facilitate this process of individual duplication, or discipleship. This does 
    not mean you are responsible to do all discipling work in the home church 
    yourselves, as we shall see. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">In the home church leaders meeting, ask whether there are 
    men and women who are truly advancing in a way that makes it likely that they 
    will be able to take a leading role in the future. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="3"><font size="+1">1. It may be that each cell ministry has 
      some in it who are not likely to fill this role anytime soon, or perhaps 
      ever. At the same time, there should ideally be at least one or two in each 
      cell who do look promising.</font></font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><font size="+1">2. If there are no such people in a cell, 
      you need to discuss how you are going to respond. The reason for the shortage 
      should be determined, and suggestions made to correct it.</font></font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><font size="+1">3. It is usually not advisable to transfer 
      someone from another cell in order to correct such a situation. Such a transfer 
      could destroy God-ordained spheres of ministry. <a href="whatmakesleader.htm">As 
      argued earlier</a>, the church needs to know who are leaders appointed by 
      God, and recognize them. If we artificially buttress people's ministry, 
      we may create the illusion that a non-leader is a leader. Better solutions 
      would be: <br>
      - cell recombination<br>
      - further perseverance in outreach<br>
      - </font></font><font size="3"><font size="+1"> upgrade the composition 
      of the weak cell through letting them follow up on neutral guests, as explained 
      below.</font></font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><font size="+1"> 4.
          After outreach, individual duplication is the first priority of the
          home church. Without movement in this area
      no lasting growth can be expected. Each cell group should understand its
    mission in terms of duplication.</font></font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font size="3"> 
<h3><font size="+1">V. Cell Group Multiplication</font></h3>
</font> 
<p><font size="+1">If individual multiplication is occurring, it should eventually 
    be possible to multiply cell groups also. When planning cell multiplication, 
    be sure to keep the larger picture in view (i.e. eventual home church planting 
    efforts), as well as the details of the particular personalities involved 
    in each new cell. </font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">Normally, the leaders of even a newly planted home church 
    should begin almost immediately discussing potential cell group planting plans. 
    This way, all the leaders understand how the others are thinking, and how 
    that affects their own ministry. Well-led home churches should experience 
    a minimum of disruption in relationships when planting a new home church. 
    People should not have to transfer from one cell group to another at the time 
    of the plant except in very rare cases. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"> To assist the leaders of cells in planning cell group multiplication,
       see the paper &quot;<a href="cellmod.htm">Ideas for Leading a Cell Group</a>.&quot; 
    Whatever plan is used, try to keep back sufficient
    people when dividing a cell to avoid leaving the original leader(s) with
    no ministry.
    Both cells must be successful if the plant is to lead to home church replication.
    In home churches with singles, there may be ministry houses to consider as
    well. If your home church has ministry houses, try
      to arrange it so that each ministry house is matched to one cell group.
    However, planting cells and planting houses may happen at different times.</font></p>
 
  <h3><font size="+1">VI. Unincorporated People</font></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">By &quot;unincorporated&quot; we mean people who do not
      yet attend  a cell group. These people appear on the solid line in a ministry
      chart. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"> The Home Church leaders should agree on who is responsible
       for long-term follow up of new people. Although the first person on the
      spot may take 
    care of <i>initial</i> follow up, there are good reasons for avoiding a &quot;first
     come first serve&quot; policy when it comes to <i>in-depth</i> follow up
     and  incorporation. Such a policy might lead to ungodly competition in the
     case 
    of perceived highly desirable new people.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"> Based on the available data, and the joint discernment of 
    the leaders, select the most appropriate ministry action for each unincorporated 
    person on the ministry chart. For most new people,
    it is reasonable to undertake to win them over to a lifestyle of involvement
    in the Body
      of Christ, and ultimately discipleship (Mt.&nbsp;28:19). The person who
      brought the guest, and the cell group (s) associated with that person normally
    undertake this mission together. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">In other cases we may have several reasons for 
        not assigning any responsibility at all. Sometimes the workers are too
          busy or there is too little likelihood of success. This could apply,
          for instance,
        to some older members who are not interested in further involvement.
      In such cases, the wisest course is often to do nothing. God may bring
      such
          a person into a more responsive frame of mind at some later time in
      their Christian life, or there may be more opportunity later. <br>
    <br>
    Since we cannot meet all needs, the first people to wait on should be those 
        who are not interested in, or responsive to, the input that has already 
        been given. Such people could still be encouraged in a more general way 
        by the home church as a whole.<br>
    <br>
    The point in waiting is not to ostracize the person, but rather to avoid 
        committing all of our limited resources to a ministry effort that is neither 
        appreciated nor effective. Worse still, we might unintentionally find ourselves 
        badgering someone who really wants to be left alone! Such badgering is not 
        effective in bringing about willing obedience to God's will.<br>
    <br>
    Periodically reevaluate any case where this posture has been adopted. People 
        in this position often begin showing signs of interest once it is clear 
        that they are not going to be forced.<br>
    <br>
    Some people think it's dangerous to have those who are not deeply involved
        present in the church (e.g. &quot;Achan theology&quot; or &quot;Jonah
        theology&quot; where
        the presence of uncommitted people may ruin the group). This notion is
        a discredited idea and is off-target ministry-wise. It is more accurate
        to say that positive outreach and discipleship will result in home church
        health. We don't need to worry about casual observers unless they begin
        to make up the majority of the church. If the consensus of your group
        begins to form in the direction of low commitment, it could endanger
        the home
      church.</font></p>
  <blockquote><font size="+1">After a plan of ministry is chosen for every unincorporated 
    person in the Home Church, the next step is to find workers or leaders who 
    can do the job. If the person in question is to be won, choose a worker or 
    leader who would be well suited to accomplish the task. This can be determined 
  by considering the following factors: </font></blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">1. The person who brought a new member to the home church 
        should have the first opportunity to disciple that member (see II Cor. 
        10:13-16; II Tim. 2:6). Exceptions to this rule of thumb would be: </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="+1">a) cases where the original outreacher is of the opposite
             sex. We have had nothing but trouble from efforts to do cross-gender
            
          discipleship. The only exception here might be situations where the
             discipler is elderly. Also, in cases of cross-gender outreach, candidates
            
          to follow the person up should normally be limited to members of the
             cell group directly related to the bringer's group. In other words,
            
          when a new home church is planted, they should normally end up in the
            same home church.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">b) cases where the original outreacher is too young 
          in the Lord to have a teaching ministry, (although in this case he/she 
          should be invited to help disciple the new one in a cell group). Remember, 
          in the early church, people commonly became leaders during their first 
          year in the Lord. Avoid over-qualifying people for ministry! Of course 
          you might be able to do a better job, but ministry is a powerful motivation 
          for growth. Because ministry is a means of growth, it will help immature 
          members to overcome sin problems that may hold them back otherwise. 
          If the bar is too high for getting involved in ministry, the morale 
          in your group will suffer.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">c) cases where the outreaching one has character flaws 
          so serious that they absolutely disqualify him/her from Christian work. 
          These flaws should be objective, serious, and recent. Again, remember 
          that ministry is a means of growth, and people may need responsibility 
          to help them overcome their bad habits.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">d) when the outreacher doesn't want to disciple the 
          new person, or fails to do so even after repeated reminders. New people 
          should not have to pay the price for sins of omission committed by our 
          established members. A warning is usually in order before by-passing 
          such an omitter.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">e) when the new person refuses to accept the leadership 
          of the one who brought him/her, then this principle may also be nullified. 
          However, every effort should be made to persuade the new one to follow 
          the outreacher. The leadership should discuss and reach consensus on 
          why the refusal happened, and whether it points to deeper problems. 
          In some cases, these refusals are relatively unimportant, reflecting 
          nothing more than sibling rivalry or similar jealousies from earlier 
          days.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">f) in rare cases where one cell group has been overwhelmed 
          with new people because of a powerful evangelist or a people movement, 
          they may plead for help from other cells. This should be the decision 
          of the overwhelmed group, not a move that is imposed on them. The norm 
          should be that even large numbers won in such situations remain in the 
          same cells together.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">g) in student groups, incoming students from younger 
          ministries (high school to college, etc.) are often unconnected, but 
          not if workers in the older group were responsible for recruiting the 
          new members (e.g. a college member has been working with the high schooler 
          in a college-led high school group.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">h) transfers from other xenos home churches, or referrals 
          from Home Group Connection are typically available to all.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">NOTE: It is very dangerous and wrong to nullify the 
          principle of allowing the outreacher to work with the new person without 
          just cause. The effect can be loss of motivation in the work force, 
          distrust of leaders, division, and faulty leadership selection.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">i) Those leaders or workers who have a proven record
            of  delivering competent, devoted home church leaders should be allowed
            to work 
          with some promising young believers if possible. This is because they
            are  most likely to succeed in delivering more leaders. Other workers
            should 
          also be given opportunities. In some cases, the older worker may come
            alongside  to help a younger discipler, but not to replace him/her.</font> </p>
        <p><font size="+1">j) Follow the principle of &quot;finishing
            old business before going on to new.&quot; We should resist the tendency
            of some leaders and workers to jump from person to person. The questions
            should be asked, &quot;What valid reason can be given for quitting
            work with your present disciple?&quot; or, &quot;Is there clear reason
            to think you will be able to do a good job with your present ministry
            as well as the new person?&quot; <br>
<br>
        k) 
      In cases where workers plead they need someone new to work with because
       they have failed with their former person, the following questions should
      
      be resolved. </font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="+1">(1) What lessons were learned?</font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">(2) Was the failure legitimate, or the result of negligence, 
              over-aggressiveness, or other errors? </font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">(3) Note the tendency of some workers to attribute 
              failures to the fact that the new person was &quot;a bad apple.&quot; 
            This is a suspicious answer, which can almost always be said in the 
              case of lost people. Only in cases where the leadership agree by consensus 
              that nothing more could have been done should we accept this tempting 
              answer.<br>
            <br>
            These issues should be discussed at the home church leaders' meeting 
              before a neutral first timer is given into the care of the one who failed. 
              Be merciful, but firm in these discussions.<br>
            <br>
            The worker's past record should be taken into account. If there is a 
              pattern of failure, other workers should be given a chance before the 
              troubled worker is given yet another chance. (The unsuccessful worker 
              has to &quot;go the end of the line&quot; for the time being.) In the 
              meantime, he/she should be counseled about ministry and encouraged to 
              evangelize. </font></p>

    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">Since any assignment to follow someone up will be respected 
      from that time on, and will not likely be changed in the future, these are 
      rather big decisions. The leaders have to balance the need for confidence 
      in a worker, with the need to take chances in ministry. There are no exact 
      guidelines for making this judgment. Try to act in a way consistent with 
      workers' characters, availability of new people, urgency of the need, and 
      fairness to all members in the home church. In questionable situations, 
      seek advice from your supervisor.</font></p>

<h3><font size="+1">VII. Leadership Development</font></h3>
</font> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">A. <b>Discern future leaders</b>. There should be a building 
    consensus of who the future leaders are, and what their capabilities will 
    be, and leaders should begin discussing possibilities and praying about them 
    at the beginning of a new home church. Leaders should also be frank on their 
    misgivings about prospective leaders. These issues involve perception and 
    interpretation, so leaders will often disagree. By discussion, prayer, and 
    gathering evidence over a period of time, the team should be able to move 
    toward consensus. Again, if the team is having trouble agreeing, get outside 
    help from your supervisor.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">B. <b>Provide a training program</b> by top qualified leaders.
       Be sure to include supervised ministry experience in your training program.
      
    The areas of thought raised in the paper &quot;<a href="cellmod.htm">A Cell
     Group Ministry Model</a>&quot; in Section VII, &quot;Content,&quot; should
      be evaluated periodically. Also, study the more detailed paper, &quot;<a href="discipleship.html">Goals
       for Personal Discipleship</a>&quot; as it relates to the lives of key
       upcoming  leaders. Read through <em><a href="/books/orgdisciple.htm">Organic Disciplemaking</a></em> by Mccallum and
       Lowery thinking about your disciples. Leaders should be prepared to satisfy
       the other leaders that those in their care are being properly trained
       and
       cared
       for. While
       no
       new
       leader
        will meet all the criteria as described, try to see some progress in
       each 
    area. Be sure to have workers in your church read Dennis and Jesse's book,
       <em>Organic Disciple Making</em> and consider how it might apply to the
       current situation.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">C. Steps to take with disciples who advance well: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">1. The first step is to make sure these people are developing
        healthy spiritual habits (like prayer and personal time with God and
        his word), working at outreach, and succeed in establishing their own
        discipling ministry.
        </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">2. Be sure they understand and are progressing on the
        other  requirements for leadership,
         including <a href="../papers/fst.htm">Fiscal Support Team</a> membership,
          since failure to qualify for the servant team will prevent them from
         being 
      leaders.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">3. Once they establish their ministries, invite them to
        begin taking the  <a href="../principles/index.htm">Christian Ministry</a>      Classes.
        While no longer required for leadership, these classes will greatly augment
        your job of equipping new leaders.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">5</font><font size="+1">. When you gain substantial confidence
        that disciples are headed for home church leadership soon, invite them
        to &quot;sit in&quot; on the leader's
        
      meeting. By sitting in on the leader's meeting, workers have the opportunity
         to see how leaders behave, think, and work. <b>Remember</b>: Don't ask
         someone  to begin sitting in leaders' meeting unless you are fairly
         certain the person 
      will progress to leadership. Try to avoid the situation where you have
        to  ask someone to leave the leaders' meeting.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">D. Try to predict and plan the next attempt at Home Church
       planting well in advance. See the <a href="planting.html">literature that
        has been written</a> to assist leaders in thinking through this very
        difficult  question. It may be necessary to hold one or more meetings
        with the leaders 
    alone (without leader trainees) in order to discuss plans frankly, including
         the progress of the leader trainees. This question should also be taken
        up 
    with your staff supervisor, since sphere oversight needs to agree with your
        plan.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">E. <b>Train new teachers</b>. Not all leaders are necessarily
       suited to be teachers, nor do all teachers have to be leaders. Timing
      becomes 
    an issue in this area. If we wait too long, new teachers will not receive
       adequate experience before a plant is attempted. If we place new teachers
      
    before the home church to early, or too often, it could harm the home church's
       growth. Tape each teaching and have the new teacher listen to his/her
      own 
    teaching. The leaders should ask new teachers if they listened to their own
       tape. Stress learning to lead quality discussions. The class on <a href="../discussion/index.htm">Leading
      Discussion</a> is good, and the <a href="../discussion/Mainhandout.htm">Material</a> from the class is available for study
      in your home church.</font></p>

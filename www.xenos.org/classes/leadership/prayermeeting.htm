<h3>Who to invite</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>  Workers’ prayer meetings are for actual or would be Christian workers. Don’t
      invite people to the meeting who are so young in the Lord that you wouldn’t
      feel comfortable talking plainly about outreach and follow up specifics in
      their presence. Remember, it’s easier to invite someone later than to un-invite
      someone. On the other hand, excited young Christians usually take to these
  meetings quite well.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>  Summary – Orientation (5 min.)</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>  The meeting leader should share a few words on where our group is at this
          point. This summary could include a brief review of past progress – “We
        started our
          campaign for outreach two months ago, and so far we’ve seen five first
        timers at home church. We’ve seen an additional nine specific answers to
        prayer,
  where people have been able to witness to someone…etc. </p>
  <p>    Then look at the objective evidence about your present state – “But we
            still haven’t seen any definite conversions or additions to cell
        groups, so we
            have a lot more to pray for…”<br>
    The purpose of this part is to coalesce the group’s thinking and
            attention to the task at hand. We need to all be on the same page
            when it comes
            to our view of the home church’s progress.<br>
  Progress assessment (15-20 min.)</p>
  <p>    The heart of this part is your prayer list. Names on a prayer list
              should be paired with the person who is leading the witnessing
        to that person.
              Starting with the names you had from last time, go over each one
              and ask whether anything
              additional has happened. If nothing has happened, ask whether it’s
              likely that
  anything will happen this week.</p>
  <p>    Part of our goal during this part is to have a prayer list that
                actually reflects what is happening. If names are on the list
        that are not
                actively being witnessed
  to, we should remove them there and then. This means several
          names will be removed each week. Explain to the group that the ideal
                  for the list
                  is that
    it contain only two kinds of people: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>    1.	Those who have been to a meeting or event within the
      past month</p>
    <p>    2. and those who were witnessed to (or pre-evangelistic talk)
      during the past week or so.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    Explain that you aren’t giving up on names removed from
                        the list, but that you are focusing attention on the
        more urgent
                        needs
                        this week. If
                        someone
                        is unhappy about their friend being removed from the
        list, explain they can get
                        them back on by witnessing to them!<br>
    An alternative (softer) approach would be to have three
                        columns:<br>
    </p>
  <table width="85%" border="1">
    <tr>
      <td width="30%">Action this week </td>
      <td width="36%">Attended during past month</td>
      <td width="34%">Other prayer requests</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>  But point out that you only have time to pray for the left two columns at this
  meeting.</p>
  <p>    For those who have showed up recently, ask the group what follow up plan
      is in place – who is on it? Are any times of contact expected? How do we
      see their
  response so far? Have they received Christ? What do we think is their attitude
  re. further involvement? What’s the next step we should pray for? What are
  key barriers we can pray away?</p>
  <p>    Next, add new names, based on the fact that someone witnessed to the person,
  or had a meaningful talk, or invited them to a meeting or event. These “this
  week” names should be written in by hand at the meeting and will appear in
  print next time.</p>
  <p>    Finally, when the final prayer list is agreed to, ask who wants to volunteer
  to pray for each name on the list. The volunteer will try to pray for the person
  each day that week. A leader can send a daily email to the home church list
  to remember to pray to your person as a reminder.</p>
  <h3>    Feedback</h3>
  <p>    During the assessment, be sure not to miss opportunities to encourage people.
  Those who were able to witness or do effective follow up should be praised
  in the presence of all for their work. Those who are discouraged should be
  reminded that some people just aren’t willing, that some people require multiple
  invitations, that you still haven’t heard a clear “no,” that maybe you should
  back off for awhile and try again in a couple of weeks, etc.</p>
  <p>    The leader guides how to think about ministry during this period, and has
      powerful ability to affect people’s perspective on their work. Don’t be
      negative unless
  you are seeing lack of effort.</p>
  <p>    Also during this period, take a few minutes to discuss the group’s participation
  and contribution to the most recent home church meeting. If people were passive,
  if the prayer was flat, if people left too early, the leader may need to express
  some strong dissatisfaction. If there was improvement, if the meeting was exciting,
  this is a time to reinforce and enjoy the fruit of a strong body life meeting.
  These are important victories that your people need to hear feedback on.</p>
  <p>    Finally, review recent and upcoming outreach events. These could be major
      (like a C&amp;C event or outreach party for the whole church) or small (like a couple
  that had friends over for a dinner party or a few guys who took friends out
  to a sporting event. If two couples are planning a neighborhood cookout or
  someone is starting a bush group at work, these should be prayed for in advance.
  Put these events on the prayer list also.</p>
  <h3>    Prayer (15-20 min.)</h3>
  <p>    During prayer, we suggest your group begin with a time of praise and thanksgiving.
      You may want to specifically suggest this, so that your time of prayer
        is done in context of a faithful and powerful God who will answer. This
        prevents
        negativity
      during prayer, and enables members to take their seat with Christ before
        asking for help. During this part, we are really presenting ourselves
        to God “as those
      alive from the dead,” rather than in Adam. Your praise and thanksgiving
        should include both specific answers to prayer or unexpected blessings,
        and more
        general acknowledgement of who God is, his relation to his body, to ministry,
        including
      evangelism, etc. (“Your word declares that unless you build the house,
        they do labor in vain who build it, and we acknowledge that you are the
        Lord of
      the harvest, and you are eager to powerfully support our efforts to reach
        out…” or, “We dare to approach you right now, knowing that you have joined
        us to
      Christ and made us members of him and each other. We rejoice that you welcome
      us into your presence, even though you are the almighty creator of the
        universe.” and “We know that it makes a difference in our ministry that
        we’ve taken
        this time to pray to you, as you tell us in your word, ‘you have not
        because you
  ask not.’”)</p>
  <p>    Then, move to specific requests in connection with the people and events
        on the prayer list. You don’t have to feel like everything on the prayer
        list
        must be prayed over, because you also have assigned prayer through the
  week.</p>
  <p>    Don’t go too long during the prayer session. Teach people how to pray
          short, succinct prayers for the edification of all. Personal prayers
          usually don’t
          belong in this type of meeting. Long, theological prayers don’t belong.
          Teach your people to all feel like they should participate, either
        through leading
          in prayer, or at least through actively saying the “Amen!” Don’t let
          your prayer meetings be quiet and drab. Insist that the whole group
        needs to
          participate and affirm prayer. You may want to teach briefly on how
        to pray at your first
          meeting.<br>
                        </p>

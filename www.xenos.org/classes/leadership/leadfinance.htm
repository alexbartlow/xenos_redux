<p><b><font size="+1">Personal stewardship is a central area of Christian living.
      Authorities on this subject claim that Jesus taught more on money than
      any other
  subject. The epistles also teach often on giving, including strong language
      warning against refusal to give. Giving is presented in the same light
      as learning
  scripture, preaching, earnestness for God, and practicing Christian love. (2
      Cor. 8:7 But just as you abound in everything, in faith and utterance and
      knowledge
  and in all earnestness and in the love we inspired in you, see that you abound
      in this gracious work also.)</font></b> 
<p><b><font size="+1">These facts suggest that giving is not just a New Testament 
  teaching, but a New Testament <i>emphasis</i>. Our own experience backs up this 
  conclusion. We find that Christian workers who don't give are usually very problematic 
  in other areas as well. In fact, refusal to give is a key symptom, pointing 
  to deep, sometimes unseen spiritual problems like lack of self control, selfishness, 
  secret drug or gambling addiction, hostility toward the church, and many others. 
  As such, leaders' teaching should reflect an emphasis in this area, but many 
  leaders mistakenly overlook stewardship in their leadership planning and assessment.</font> 
  Consider the following points in building an effective leadership approach in 
  this area.</b> 
</font> 
<dir> 
  <dir> 
    <p><font size="+1">1. The first thing to do is review the theology of church 
      and personal finance. Carefully study the paper, &quot;<a href="cnfinc.html">The 
      New Testament Pattern of Church Finance</a>.&quot; Also, reading such as 
      Gene Getz, <i>A Theology of Material Goods</i> is excellent. Developing 
      your own strong convictions on giving must precede effective leading in 
      this area. Teach these principles in home church.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">2. According to Luke 16, your disciples will never be
        trusted by God to take care of the riches of the church unless they first
        become
      faithful in stewardship. When we think about our own history, it is not
        surprising that God picks this objective area as a litmus test for reliability
        in ministry. Crying out Hallelujah or standing to teach are easy to fake,
        but giving our money away in good quantity is something the selfish refuse
        to do. If people are serving God for selfish reasons, they will betray
        their
      true motives by their refusal to give.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">3. Not only is non-giving a sign of selfishness, it may 
      also be an important cause. The act of giving teaches us to view our riches 
      as belonging to God. Giving is a discipline that constantly forces us to 
      curb the flesh and live out our priorities in deed, not in word.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">4. Not surprisingly, successful and well-led home churches
        are consistently among the top giving home churches. Weak giving churches
        are generally also weak in growth and discipleship as well. This correlation
      is predictable based on Luke 16.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">5. Non-giving disciples will be rejected from the servant 
      team by Xenos elders. Not only must deacons belong to the <a href="../papers/fst.htm">Fiscal 
      Support Team</a>, they must have a history of consistency in this area.
      Therefore, if you are hoping to raise up leaders, you must see progress
      in this area. Start early with your disciples teaching them the reasons
      for giving and encouraging them to begin practicing this central area of
      Christian living. Help disciples learn sound principles of personal finance,
      including getting out of excessive debt. If spending or debt is out of
      control,
      urge them to take one of the <a href="../../ministries/gift/index.htm">Gift</a> 
      personal finance classes.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">6. Your annual stewardship presentation to the home church 
      or your cell groups in January should be well-studied and strong. Consider 
      using a combined cell group if you are worried about teaching on stewardship 
      with nonChristians present. Consider approaching members beforehand with 
      the idea that you would like to have the whole church take a stand together 
      to make pledges at the presentation, and you will bring the pledge cards 
      up to the office as one. Have testimonies ready from members who joined 
      the Fiscal Support Team and experienced the presentations for the first 
      time that year, or testimonies from those who have turned the corner in 
      the area of stewardship.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">7. Occasionally have missionaries who are raising support 
      come to your home church or combined cell to present their mission. Urge 
      your members to get involved as prayer partners and supporters.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">8. Mark well those members who you know are strong givers 
      and use them as examples to the church. This was done in the New Testament 
      church (Paul used the Macedonians as an example to the Corinthians in 1 
      Cor. 8, and Barnabas and others were known to the whole Jerusalem church 
      as having given up property for the common good according to Acts 4:36,7).</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">9. You should periodically ask your key disciples how things 
      are going with their giving. Many leaders are surprised when they nominate 
      disciples to the Servant Team, only to find out they haven't been giving. 
      Ask your supervisor for feedback on how your home church is doing on giving. 
      The office can't share specifics on your members' giving, but they can tell 
      you how your group is doing.</font></p>

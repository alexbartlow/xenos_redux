<p><font size="+1">In the New Testament God used human leaders to bring blessing
    and feeding to the church. From the day of Pentecost, the apostles acted
    as <i>de facto</i> leaders. They preached, taught, (Acts 2:42) and ruled
    on issues that came up for debate (Acts 6:1,2). They were able to delegate
    leadership to others (Acts 6:3,4).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">After the period of the Jerusalem church, attention shifts
    to Paul's missionary journeys. Paul, too, was an apostle, and an obvious
    leader. He served in Antioch with a group of men who were said to be &quot;<b>prophets
    and teachers</b>.&quot; (Acts 13:1) These were probably <b>the elders in
    Antioch</b>, though never says that. It does record that &quot;they&quot; [probably
    the same men] <b>laid hands on Paul and Barnabas and sent them off on the
    first journey</b>.&quot; The reason they chose Paul and Barnabas was divine
    election (see below). On that first journey we see them appointing elders
    in the new churches they planted. (Acts 14:23) The fasting and prayer that
    preceded these appointments suggests they were seeking God's choice for leaders.
    These appointments ware made during their return trip through these cities,
    indicating that <b>some time had passed (probably only weeks)</b> since their
    original visit.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">During the second journey, Paul <b>added Timothy to his band</b>,
    likely leading to Timothy's eventual <b>recognition as an apostle</b>. Although
    this is never actually stated, Timothy <b>acts in the role of an apostle</b> in <b>appointing
    elders</b> and <b>overseeing elders</b> according to 1 Timothy. (Ch. 3; 5:17ff)
    The only criteria given in Acts for why Paul chose Timothy is that &quot;The
    brothers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him.&quot; (Acts 16:2) However,
    in 2 Tim. 1:6 Paul refers to bestowing gifts on Timothy by the laying on
    of his own hands (most likely the gift of apostleship). This is also referred
    to in 1 Tim. 4:14 where Paul reminds him of his gift, &quot;which was bestowed
    upon you through prophetic utterance with the laying on of hands by the presbytery.&quot; Thus,
    if a prophetic utterance was the occasion of Timothy's choosing, we again
    have a case of divine election.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Both Timothy and Titus are given the job of appointing elders.
    Of interest is the fact that Paul has left them behind to do this work, implying
    that it was not possible to select elders when he was there. This suggests
    that they wanted to see these men actually living out leadership roles before
    making the choice to recognize them as elders. Likewise, Paul cautions Timothy
    about deacons: &quot;They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing
    against them, let them serve as deacons.&quot; (1 Tim. 3:10)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Overarching these observations about leadership in the early
    church, we see evidence of divine election in the selection of leaders. This
    should be clear for the following reasons.</font></p>

    <td valign="top" width="825"><font size="+1">The Apostles were chosen by
        Christ. The correct context of John 15:16 (You did not chose me, but
        I chose you) is not unconditional election or irresistible grace, but
        election to the role of apostle. Likewise, God's choice is evident in
        the story of Paul's conversion (where God refers to his future ministry)
        and in the story of the Spirit speaking to the leaders at Antioch in
        Acts 13 (saying, &quot;Set apart for me Paul and Barnabas...&quot;).
        Timothy was apparently named an apostle by a prophetic message from God.
        (1 Tim. 4:14) We find, therefore, that when it comes to the role of leadership
        in the New Testament, the key is whether or not God has chosen the person. </font></td>

        to you or from you? You are our letter, written in our hearts...&quot; Here,
        Paul contrasts human credentials (letters of commendation) to his own
        credentials, which are nothing less than the marks of divine election.
        Instead of humans writing his letter, he says the Spirit of God wrote
        it on human hearts.</font></td>

        assigns fields of ministry, and Paul's proof that he was assigned the

        is a gift of leadership. Likewise, Eph. 4:11,12 says, &quot;It was he
        [God] who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists,
        and some to be pastors and teachers, to prepare God's people for works
        of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up.&quot; This is
        in harmony with the notion that God &quot;has arranged the parts in the
        body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be.&quot; (1 Cor.
        12:18) In other words, these passages seem to say that God chooses who
        should lead his church. We believe leaders can serve even without a gift
        of leadership, although we should seek out and include those with such
        a gift if they have good character. </font></td>

        best explanation for why deacons are tested before they are ordained.
        The existing leadership seems to assume that God has certain people whom
        he wants to lead, and their mission is to discern who those people are.

          God often made a personal appearance to choose leaders, as with Abraham

          following the sheep, that you should be leader over My people Israel.&quot; (1Chron.

<p><font size="+1">We conclude that God, not humans, makes a person a spiritual
    leader. As existing church leaders, our mission is not to create leaders
    out of non-leaders by naming them or ordaining them. On the contrary, our
    mission is to discern whom God has chosen to be a leader, and to ratify,
    or <em>recognize</em> that choice. In naming leaders we are indicating that
    we believe God has shown this person is already chosen to be a leader because
    he or she is already doing the work of a leader and has the character of
    a leader.</font></p>
<h2>Implications</h2>
<p><font size="+1">The implications of this perspective on leadership are profound.
    If we conclude that God chooses leaders, our goal becomes cooperatiaon with
    the choice of God in assuring that only divinely appointed leaders are recognized.

            when giving, or providing ministry to a young Christian. We should

            a young worker into a well-developed ministry he or she did not actually
            build. Otherwise, we might simulate from the human side what God
            should provide from his side. The result could be that a person appears
            to be chosen by God, when in fact we have installed the person in
            their position artificially. Installing a person into a developed
            ministry will often result in the &quot;turtle on a fence post&quot; syndrome
            (i.e. the turtle didn't put himself there, someone else placed him
            there). We may harm both the church and the individual when we interfere
            with God's election in this way. It makes more sense to offer young
            workers opportunities to follow up new people and form discipleship
            relationships than to offer them ready-made leadership roles like
            existing cell groups or home groups. An exception to this would be
            cases where a person has proven leadership in one venue, and we call
            on them to move to a new ministry. This was apparently what Barnabas
            did when he summoned Paul from Tarsus to Antioch. </font></td>

        <td valign="top" width="740"><font size="+1">We should be very reluctant
            to <em>remove</em> ministry from a young Christian worker. Such removal
            could result in a subsequent failure to recognize God's choice of
            the person for leadership because humans have disrupted his or her
            ministry every time it begins to flourish. There are important exceptions
            to this rule of thumb warranted in Scripture. The main exception
            would be the case where the young worker has disqualified him or
            herself by recent, serious, and objective sin. Scripture teaches
            the importance of moral character for Christian workers in passages
            like the requirements for deacons, (which, if violated could result
            in disqualification). Although young workers are not deacons, the
            principle would still apply to some extent, that anyone who serves
            the Lord needs to live up to minimal standards of Christian character.
            The the Bible provides examples of leaders removed from leadership
            due to sin or false teaching (1&nbsp;Tim:1:20; 3 John 9,10). But
            these passages indicate that such removal should involve serious
            sin, not minor slip-ups. We would assume the same thing with young
            workers--they should not be removed from ministry because of minor
            slip-ups. All the passages warning against hypocrisy also imply that
            those trying to lead others, should be doing what they preach to
            a large extent. (Luke 12:1) &quot;Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees,
            which is hypocrisy.&quot;</font></td>

            restore one who has been removed from leadership back to leadership
            unless the signs of divine election are again evident. This usually
            means the person has returned to the beginning stages of ministry
            and re-built their following. An exception to this might be situations

            leaders usually have to depend on external credentials or hearsay
            for their legitimacy. Although we see the example of Barnabas bringing
            Paul in from Tarsus to Antioch, Barnabas had personal knowledge of
            Paul and his ability. Paul had also planted more than one church
            in Syria and Cilicia before Barnabas came for him. (Acts. 15:36,41) </font></td>

<p><font size="+1">Even with these principles, the business of determining God's
    calling remains subjective. We are often reduced to guesswork when naming
    leaders, because there are so many variables involved. We usually are faced
    with compromise in at least some areas with every leader we recognize. Pray
    often that God will clearly indicate his choices for leadership. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Even churches that work toward installing only leaders chosen
    and manifested by God will sometimes find they have leaders who don't belong.
    These are usually painful situations that call for grace and firmness. Certainly
    every church would hope to keep such situations to a minimum. Ideally, we
    should have all our leaders actually functioning as leaders, all belonging
    in their roles because God himself has chosen to put them there. Realistically,
    this will not be the case, because even some who were chosen to be leaders
    at one time, later act in such a way to discredit themselves, or for other
    reasons are no longer able to serve (e.g. Paul and Barnabas sent away from
    Antioch). Therefore, this issue becomes a perpetual area of tension in the
    church as new leaders are considered, and older leaders are reconsidered.
    Our best move is to follow principles calculated to maximize the likelihood
    of chosen leaders holding authority so we have a God-made, not a man-made
    leadership in the church.</font></p>

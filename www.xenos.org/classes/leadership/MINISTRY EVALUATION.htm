<p><span class="style1">MINISTRY EVALUATION</span><br />
    <span class="style2"><em>Various  leaders in Xenos jointly composed this document during the 1980&rsquo;s. We don't disseminate it widely because of the sensitive nature of the pastoral  issues raised. Your notes on people you pastor are private, so you should keep  them confidential.</em><br />
I Cor. 9:26 - &ldquo;Therefore, I run in such a way, as  not without aim; I box in such a way, as not beating the air.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h1>I. Purpose</h1>
<p class="style2">This work sheet is intended to be an aid  to help us follow the principle stated above:  that we should not be aimless in our ministries. Stated positively, this work  sheet is intended to assess the progress and needs of the person to whom we are  ministering, and then to prayerfully map out goals and strategies for how we  can more effectively love that person.<br />
  You need to pray as you go through this  study. God may show you things you hadn&rsquo;t considered. For each question that  asks &ldquo;why?&rdquo; or &ldquo;why not?&rdquo; answer as frankly and concretely as possible. Do not  give vague or general answers such as, &ldquo;She needs to understand grace more,&rdquo; or  &ldquo;He/she needs to receive the love of God.&rdquo; These responses are not helpful because they express goals of the Christian life, rather than practical reasons  why a person is lacking in an area of his/her walk. Instead, give practical  answers like: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t told him how to do it yet,&rdquo;  or &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t show him the importance of this area,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think it is appropriate to get into this area yet.&rdquo;<br />
  The questions are intended to get us  thinking in a way that allows us to come up with a complete picture of the  situation. Keep in mind that if this work sheet is to be effective in helping to discover areas of need, we will  have to be honest! Take responsibility for your failures.<br />
  Because the worksheet is mainly intended  to help a Christian worker think and pray through  complex ministry situations and possibly arrive at new ideas, it should be used  privately. Be very careful about sharing this with others because most of the  assessments are subjective and tentative.<br />
  Notice that you may not know the answer  to many of the questions. Where this is the case, just write, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;  These questions help point up areas we should investigate  further.</p>

f) Overall Appraisal --We all have sin  areas, but are any of these areas really devastating to his/her walk? Do you  think it may be essential to try to minister to one or more of these areas  soon? Which area needs to come first?<br />
  <br />
  Remember that people don&rsquo;t change everything at once. We will have to decide  which areas are more important than the others, so that we will know which ones  we must get involved with, and which ones we can ignore for now. Have you seen  an adequate motivational base for the change you want to see? (In other words,  people usually don&rsquo;t give up one thing until they have something to replace it  with). Also, will you recognize progress when it occurs, or are you expecting  to see a sudden and complete disappearance of the problem? Record your  assessment.<br />
  </span><br />
</p>
<h3>G. Potential Strengths &amp; Progress So  Far</h3>
<p><br />
  <span class="style2">1. What vision do you have for this type  of person in the Body of Christ? Does the person have the same vision  for him/herself? Are you excited about this vision?<br />

  <br />

  4. Does he/she believe that all his/her strengths  belong to God and are to be used for His purposes?<br />
  5. Does he/she know practical steps that will  develop his/her strengths?</span><br />
</p>
<h1>III. Self-adjusting Your Outlook </h1>
<h3>A. Questions to ask yourself:</h3>
<p class="style2">  1. Have you remembered that we will be  unable to motivate someone unless we believe in them? Have you projected  confidence in your person?<br />
  <br />
  2. Are you sure you are not developing a  problem-oriented approach with your person? Explain why.<br />
  <br />
  3. Are you keenly aware of the slightest  progress in his/her life, and are you able to reinforce and encourage it  effectively?<br />
  <br />
  4. Have you remembered that confrontation  is most effective when it is used sparingly and within the context of a  relationship that is positive and encouraging?</p>
<h1>IV. Consultation and Further Adjustment</h1>
<p class="style2">A. If possible, check your assessments on  this paper with other competent workers.<br /> 
  <br />
  B. How do your views compare with theirs? <br />
  <br />
  C. Are you more negative or softer than  them? <br />
  <br />
  D. Do others tend to agree with each  other? <br />
  <br />
  E. Who do you think is right and why?</p>
<h1>V. Overview</h1>
<p><span class="style2">A. Considering everything you have  written, what word or phrase would you use to describe this believer&rsquo;s state at  this time?<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  B. What should your feeling be in view of  this big picture?</span><br />
  <br />
</p>
<h1>VI. Strategy</h1>
<p class="style2">A. Carefully determine which area needs  attention first. Explain why you think your answer is right. Remember that the  most important area may not be the area you can address first. <br />
    <br />
  B. Develop a plan of action in order to  lovingly affect change in this area. Your plan should include things like the following:</p>
<p class="style2">  1. What specific attitudes or outlooks need  to be fostered at this time?<br />
  <br />
  2. Will he/she need to be persuaded of  the correctness and/or the importance of this area? Don&rsquo;t call for change in  the area of action, unless you are fairly certain that the person first understands  the reasons and holds convictions in that area.<br />
  <br />
  3. Give an estimate of how you think  he/she will respond. Is there more to be done before you approach him/her with  this issue?<br />
  <br />
  4. When will you try to talk with  him/her? Be sure to choose the proper setting. Avoid the temptation to bring up  problems on the spur of the moment. Anything negative should usually be brought  up in private.<br />
  <br />
  5. Think about what you will say, and how  you will say it. Include specific plans in the following areas:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="style2">  a) How do you want to come off? With  warmth? Concern? Confidence in them? Surprise? Challenging? Why? <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    b) What benefits will accrue to him/her  if he/she does what you suggest?<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    c) What danger would accompany failure to  change?<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    d) How will you introduce or bring up the  subject? Remember, this may determine whether or not the rest of what you say  is received.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    e) What are you going to do if the person  responds differently than you expected, such as disagreement or resistance?  (i.e. continued persuasion, a suggestion that he/she think it over, nothing  further on your part, etc.) Why?<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    f) What positive encouragement do you  plan to include? <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    e) How will you know change has occurred?  Remember that often, people respond in action very differently than they did  verbally. Name some behaviors that might suggest change has occurred. (Matt. 21:28-32).<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    g) Is your expectation of change in  action realistic? Does reflection on your past ministry reveal that you tend to  expect too little, or too much? Why do you think your expectation is realistic?  Be sure to correct for your usual tendencies.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    g) What will you do if change does occur?  Would it be best to bring up further changes immediately, or to wait for a  while? Why? How will you encourage more of the same?<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    h) What will you do if change doesn&rsquo;t  occur? Will you suggest the same change again soon, or wait for a while? Will  you go about it differently? Will you confront him/her with failure, or ignore  failure and try again? Why? <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    i) If you have decided to go for a lesser  (partial) change, what are the reasons for your change in strategy?<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    j) How will you assure that you have a  proper attitude and realistic plan before you talk to him/her? 
  </span><br />
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style2">6. What will you say before any plea or  admonition to set the context? (e.g. &ldquo;You know how long we&rsquo;ve been together,  and how much I value our friendship&hellip;&rdquo;)</p>

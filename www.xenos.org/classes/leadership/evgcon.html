<p><font size="+1">Good evangelism is God's will for the church (II Cor.5:19,20).
When the church loses its evangelistic edge, the sentence is spiritual death.
    No amount of study, love, sharing, or serving will save the church when we
    have
    no
    evangelism. This is the first priority for leaders.</font>
<p><font size="+1">Although
      we can use a wide variety of evangelistic methods, our job as leaders is
      to
      understand
      and
      teach those
      principles that
      are most
      suitable
      and effective
      in our home church. The following evangelistic concepts are all evident
    in scripture. Included under each biblical principle are suggestions for
    effective
implementation.</font>
<p><font size="+1">To agitate for evangelism, lead in evangelism, and empower
    evangelism, nothing works better than an evangelism-centered <a href="prayermeeting.htm">Worker's
    Prayer Meeting</a>. Study the prayer meeting handout carefully. All our following
    comments assume you have an effective prayer offensive in place already in
you home church.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="4"><b><font size="+1">I. Warm Medium (Friendship) Evangelism</font></b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <p><font size="+1">A. Evangelism occurs most easily within existing (&quot;warm&quot;)
        relationships, rather than by talking to strangers (&quot;cold medium&quot;).
        Our friends and family are more likely to take the gospel seriously when
        we share because of the credibility we already have with them. Our non-Christian
        friends find it easier to envision themselves becoming Christians because
        they identify more with us than a stranger would.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">B. Scripture gives examples of warm medium evangelism.
        See Jn. 1:41-51, Acts 16:30-34, and II Tim. 1:5.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">C. For an important source on this kind of evangelism,
        see <i>Bridges of God</i>, by Donald McGavern, He calls people who have
        warm relationships with non-Christians &quot;bridges&quot; because they
        open new people groups to evangelization. Although this book is about
        foreign missions, it applies equally to our mission field.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">D. Application</font>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <p><font size="+1">1. If your Home Church is regularly seeing new people
            (several per month) who are not &quot;visitors&quot;, it suggests
            you probably have active bridge people in your group. If this is
            the case, consider the following measures:</font>
        <ul>
          <ul>
            <p><font size="+1">a) Help the people who are bridges by making sure
                their spiritual and relational needs are being met so they continue
                to grow. Watch for Satan's attack on these people.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">b) Avoid calling on them to spend so much time
                with Christians that they lose their relationships with non Christian
                friends. </font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">c) Make sure they are aware of the opportunity
                they have to reach their friends and loved ones. </font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">d) Think of ways you can help them get a vision
                for seeing their friends find Christ and grow spiritually.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">e) Think of ways to help them reach their friends
                and loved ones, including <em><strong>going with them</strong></em> to social events where
                you can meet their friends. </font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">f) Think through with them the basic communication
                factors in witnessing. For instance: the best setting, ways to
                come off, wording, ways to broach the subject, etc.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">g) Teach them to respond properly and patiently
                to those who are not initially responsive. Suggest ways to respond
                to various questions or comments they encounter. The leader is
                a counselor/consultant in this situation. &quot;So, have you
                had any more talks with so-and-so?&quot; &quot;What did she say?&quot; &quot;And
                what did you say to that?&quot; &quot;Not bad! Here's another
                idea if that comes up again...&quot; These are the kind of questions
                and comments we should be making weekly to a bridge person.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">h) Handling flack and rejection: New Christians
                are often surprised and dismayed to find the level of hostility
                from some people. They need help processing this without becoming
                defeated or timid.</font></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><font size="+1">- Sometimes people are defensive when they are
                  under conviction</font></p>
              <p><font size="+1">- Some of us were the same way, shortly before
                  receiving Christ</font></p>
              <p><font size="+1">- It takes time for family and friends to accept
                  changes in one of their own</font></p>
              <p><font size="+1">- Initial resistance often gives way you persist
                  and your life changes, etc.</font></p>
            </blockquote>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="+1">2. If you have believers in the Home Church who have
            relationships with non-Christians, then they are at least potential
            bridges. When working with potential bridges:</font> <br>
        <ul>
          <ul>
            <p><font size="+1">a) Determine whether people are witnessing to
                their non Christian friends. Try to tactfully discover whether
                people are witnessing without seeming to be demanding. If a cell
                member is not mentioning conversations he/she is having with
                non-Christians, there probably are no such conversations. Try
                asking, &quot;What do your friends think about your Christian
                experience?&quot; or better still, &quot;What does so-and-so
                think of you being a Christian?&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">b) We need to convince our people that outreach
                is right, and that it is important.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">c) We have to convince our people that winning
                their friends is fun and fulfilling</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">d) Growing Christians usually inwardly want to
                witness, if they have been under sound teaching. What reason
                might there be for inhibition?</font></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><font size="+1">i) Not knowing what to say: We find that one
                  of the most common reasons for aversion to witnessing is the
                  fear that comes from ignorance. Use guides like Hybels and
                  Middleberg, <i>Becoming a Contagious Christian</i> or Fay,
                  <em>Sharing Jesus Without Fear</em> to give practice on sharing
                  one's testimony and a simple gospel message.</font></p>
              <p><font size="+1">ii) Go with the person and meet his friends.
                  Pray for a chance to have your disciples see how you relate
                  to non Christians and how you witness.</font></p>
              <p><font size="+1">iii) People from fundamentalist backgrounds,
                  or long standing believers sometimes develop the feeling that
                  no one is interested in the gospel. What would be the best
                  response to such a fear?</font></p>
              <p><font size="+1">iv) People fear rejection or ridicule. Try
                  some role-playing to show how a person can respond graciously
                  and victoriously to a rejecter. Teach them to always ask &quot;Why?&quot;
                  when someone makes a negative comment or expresses disinterest.
                  Tell stories about ridiculers who later were converted.</font></p>
              <p><font size="+1">v) Sometimes believers have an identity problem
                  that leads them to deliberately conceal the fact that they
                  are Christians from their secular friends. What would be an
                  appropriate response to this situation?</font></p>
            </blockquote>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="+1">3. If you have neither active nor potential bridges
            in your Home Church, you are limited to cold medium evangelism.</font></p>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <font size="4"><b>
    <p><font size="+1">II. Cold Medium Evangelism</font> 
    </b></font>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <p><font size="+1">A. Cold Medium Evangelism means that we begin to focus
            on relationships that are relatively more distant or even non-existent
            in order to find those with whom we will communicate.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">B. First realize that a home church limited to cold
            medium evangelism is not in a hopeless condition. Far from it! Many
            churches in this position have broken through to victory. However,
            this kind of outreach is usually more difficult, and it requires
            more
            patience.
            When the Home Church is struggling in the area of outreach, the leaders
            and workers must guide the attitude of the church. Rather than giving
            way to panic or demoralization, express confidence that people all
            around us are spiritually hungry and  want to hear
            the gospel (Matt. 9:37; Acts 18:10), and
            that Christ will build His church (Matt. 16:18). This
            situation is an opportunity to teach and to demonstrate faith in
            the promises and power of God.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">C. The best good beginning point is  to approach
            God on this issue. With the interested workers in your
            group,
            try
            to add names to a prayer list over a period of weeks. Cell groups
            and special prayer meetings are ideal for this ministry. What scriptures
            speak to specific prayer about evangelism?</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">D. Don't make the mistake of thinking God will honor
            a passive attitude in this area, or that He will bring about evangelism
            apart from human agency (i.e. search theology). As a leader, what
            attitudes and actions do you need to cultivate in order to be an
            example to the Church in this area?</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">E. Practical steps: When a church has lost it's warm
            bridges, it is in serious danger of losing all spiritual vitality.
            Leaders in the group need to face the danger, and embark on a campaign
            of leading change--from whatever has prevailed until now, to a situation
            with regular effective evangelism. Remember the steps detailed in
            the paper on <a href="leadingchange.htm">leading change</a>. </font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="+1">First gather evidence that the problem exists, and
              take this to your fellow leaders. Agree with them that a program
              of change is essential. Prepare together to pay the price for change. </font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">Then, go to the group and &quot;thaw the situation,&quot; using
              your evidence and any that other leaders may have contributed.
              Be careful to avoid panic or undue fear. Combine conviction of
              need with confidence in the power of God and the integrity and
              competence of your people. </font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">Next, &quot;pursue change to the appropriate level
              of tension.&quot; Think in terms of a several-month campaign that
              results in successful outreach, not a week or two of banging the
              drum. During the campaign, consider steps like the following:</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
          <ul>
            <p><font size="+1">1. Through Home Church and Cell Group, instruct
                your people on the biblical basis for evangelism (without neglecting
                other areas of doctrine). List several truths that require solid
                convictions in order for a biblical basis to be built. Include
                the antithesis: that a group without evangelism is doomed--not
                this week or this month, but eventually, this is a problem the
                group <i>must</i> solve together. Agree together that there will
                be no complacency in your group--you must see a harvest!</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">2. Check to see if there are past guests who have
                been neglected. If so, how can this be corrected? Cold medium
                outreach requires very careful management of a follow up list,
                as we can't afford to miss any opportunity. We will discuss <a href="hcfoll.htm">follow
                up</a> later.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">3. The leadership has to be the first to witness.
                It isn't important that leaders succeed, only that they try,
                and can recount their attempts to the rest of the church.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">4. If possible, allow your disciple(s) to accompany
                you when you witness. This gives them the opportunity to learn
                by example (I Cor. 4:16; 11:1). Even if you don't get to witness,
                the act of going out to a venue where you can meet people will
                be positive.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">5. Evangelism is sometimes hazardous and difficult
                work. Are your people being helped, praised, and encouraged for
                all of their outreach attempts, even if unsuccessful? See Paul's
                application of this principle in I Thes. 1.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">6. You and your people should share your witnessing
                experiences with each other and pray for each other in specific
                cases of outreach.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">7. If someone gets a chance to witness, be sure
                to celebrate that answer to prayer privately and publicly. Come
                back to that case in subsequent weeks and ask if anything else
                has happened.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">8. Find ways to role-play bringing the gospel
                up with people, such as Pippert's questions to use in evangelism: </font>
            <ul>
              <ul>
                <p><font size="+1">&quot;How have your impressions of God changed
                    over the past few years?&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font size="+1">&quot;What is your impression of people who
                    call themselves Christians?&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font size="+1">or my suggestion:</font></p>
                <p><font size="+1">&quot;Would you consider yourself a spiritual
                    person?&quot; </font></p>
                <p><font size="+1">followed by either &quot;Why not?&quot; or &quot;What
                    does that mean to you?&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font size="+1">or this suggestion from Neil Cole:</font></p>
                <p><font size="+1">First engage in conversation, looking for
                    insight into the other person on one of three things: 1)
                    his pain 2)his passion 3)his purpose. If you are successful
                    in uncovering information on any of these, ask if you can
                    pray for the person. (They usually say &quot;yes.&quot;)
                    Then, pray for them, there and then! Cole says they usually
                    do this with a hand on their shoulder. Offer a short personal
                    prayer and end it. The assumption is that by saying yes,
                    the person has authorized God to become involved. By being
                    in the presence of a praying Christian, they will witness
                    how a personal relationship with God works, and also will
                    be impacted directly by the Holy Spirit. These cases usually
                    lead to subsequent opportunities to share more, and are also
                    usually appreciated by the person.</font></p>

            <p><font size="+1">9. Another strategy in cold medium witnessing
                is to begin by building warm relationships with non-Christians.
                See teaching material on the subject of building new friendships,
                such as that in <i>Organic Disciple Making</i>, by McCallum and
                Lowery. However, you should <em>never view this as a necessary
                prerequisite </em>                for evangelism. Always be prepared
                to share the gospel early in a relationship.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">10. Teach your people to ask questions. We typically
                find Christians making the mistake of thinking that the important
                thing is knowing what to say. We need to convince them that even
                more important is knowing how to listen. See Fay's &quot;Hmmm principle,&quot;
                where he never says anything but &quot;Hmmm&quot; to people's answers
                to his questions (<em>Share Jesus Without Fear</em>). Learning
                about a person's perspective and past may powerfully affect how
                we
                witness.
                Find
                out what, if any, church background the person had, and their
                attitude toward it. Teach on different levels of conversation
                wherein different questions become appropriate:</font>

                  -What is the source of beauty? <br>

              </ul>
            </ul>
            <p><font size="+1">11. Don't make the mistake of thinking cold medium
                evangelism won't work. The key here is to realize that some people
                are effective in a cold medium situation, while others are less
                so. The leader has the job of &quot;equipping the saints for
                service,&quot; (Eph.4:12) which includes  helping members succeed
                in different kinds of evangelism.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">12. Activities can be planned where cold medium
                outreach might occur. We need a certain level of stimulation
                at such events in order to hold the interest of secular visitors. <a href="../../ministries/justforfun/cc1.htm">Conversation
                and Cuisine</a>, Mom's Playgroups and evangelistic parties have
                all been used at Xenos with good results.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">13. Don't assume that only certain temperament
                types can do cold medium communication. Leaders are regularly
                surprised to find that the one bringing in a new person is the
                one they thought would be unable.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">14. During your campaign, regular, objective feedback
                is usually sufficient to raise the tension in the home church.
                Don't overlook any answers to prayer, but don't exaggerate success
                either. &quot;Since we began praying about this, God has granted
                us three different opportunities to share with non Christians.
                However, we still haven't seen anyone new at home church.&quot; Remember
                that what a group talks about is what they tend to do. Make it
                a point to bring this subject up with such regularity (both in
                group and individual situations) that people realize the issue
                won't go away, and has to be solved.</font></p>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="+1">F. Check to see if your Home Church meetings are enjoyable
            and edifying. Check to see what your members think. If the meeting
            is not perceived as fun, evaluate the reasons for this and make needed
            changes. Meeting quality is more important than usual under conditions
            requiring cold medium outreach. Are some teachers not interesting
            enough to be in the rotation? It may be right to consider shortening
            the teachings, and encouraging more group participation and discussion.
            A group with little or no outreach need not worry about training
            new teachers. Unless things change, they will never be needed! Focus
            on your best teachers until you see outreach occurring in the church.
            Consider only letting those teach who have brought someone new during
            the past year.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">G. A winsome home church meeting (not to mention larger
            meetings) must exhibit a level of enthusiasm. While we want our teachers
            to lead in this area, this part is not just the teacher's responsibility.
            We must convince our members to come outside of themselves, to resist
            their inhibitions, and to outwardly express their excitement and
            gratefulness to God in emotional ways. Times of discussion and prayer
            are ideal for verbal affirmations of excitement about God. We may
            have to lead a dual campaign struggling for outreach and for enthusiasm
            at the same time. Enthusiastic responses must become habitual, and
            this means practice, even when no outsider is present. We need to
            sell our people on the idea that a Christian meeting should always
            be enthusiastic in view of what God has given us.</font></p>

    </b></font>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <p><font size="+1">A. People usually make big decisions (like coming
            to Christ) by going through a process rather than all at once. This
            process has been called the &quot;decision continuum.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">B. As leaders, we should ascertain that our people
            are not trying to move people from dim awareness of the gospel to
            a decision to receive Christ in one step. Rather, they should be
            aware of where the person is in the decision-making process, and
            whether they are moving realistically towards the point of final
            decision.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">C. Carefully teach your people that they are trying
            to help others to come to an informed, freewill decision to receive
            Christ. When this principle is disregarded, people are usually either
            needlessly scared off, or they make insincere decisions that don't
            last. See Paul's application of this principal in Acts 17:1-4.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">D. Make your people aware of the negative stereotypes
            most Americans have of Christians, and discuss how to anticipate,
            detect, and overthrow those views. </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">E. Beyond teaching the theory of proper outreach,
            practical teaching is also important.</font>
        <ul>
          <ul>
            <p><font size="+1">1. <b>Reading The Situation</b>. Christians sometimes
                have trouble sensing what the other person's response is. Yet
                this kind of discernment is crucial to many areas of Christian
                work, as well as building relationships in general. Since it
                is a subjective skill, step by step teaching is impossible. What
                is the best way to teach this ability?</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">2. <b>Appropriate Response Options</b>. Based
                on the worker's discernment in a communication situation, a response
                must be chosen on the spot. The response chosen should be appropriate
                and effective. Such a response could range from simply encouraging
                the non-Christian to continue questioning, to a more direct invitation
                to deeper involvement.</font>
            <ul>
              <ul>
                <p><font size="+1">a) There are no firm rules for making this
                    decision. The worker is left to his/her own sensitivity and
                    experience in matching the present attitude of the new person
                    to the response. Follow the general rule of thumb that one
                    should offer more to a responsive person, and should offer
                    less to an unresponsive person.</font></p>
                <p><font size="+1">b) Advancing &amp; retreating--teach your
                    people to advance toward responsiveness and retreat from
                    unresponsiveness. Periodic advancing and retreating has more
                    effect than constant advancing.</font></p>
                <p><font size="+1">c) In what ways can you know if the workers
                    in your home church are aware of, and are using the decision
                    continuum in their ministry to both non-Christians and disciples?
                    Can you list several general principles that would be helpful
                    in determining which response would be appropriate for a
                    given situation? </font></p>

    </b></font>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <p><font size="+1">A. The central message of Christianity (that salvation
            is a free gift and that one can have a personal relationship with
            Christ), has the ability to profoundly affect people on a spiritual
            level. The Holy Spirit works in cooperation with this message to
            convict the hearer of its truthfulness and of their need for Christ.
            This is why Paul said he was careful to stay focused on declaring
            this message (&quot;I determined to know nothing among you but Jesus
            Christ, and Him crucified.&quot; I Cor. 2:1-5). The effective evangelist
            trusts the power of this message and knows that it will impact the
            hearer, regardless of the hearer's initial, visible response. </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">B. Teaching Evangelistic Content</font>
        <ul>
          <ul>
            <p><font size="+1">1. We often discover that inexperienced Christian
                communicators are engaging in debate with non-Christians regarding
                peripheral issues, rather than explaining the grace of God. </font>
            <ul>
              <ul>
                <p><font size="+1">a) One of the best ways to determine this
                    is to ask them to recount a conversation they have already
                    alluded to. Another would be to watch them witness.</font></p>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <p><font size="+1">2. One reason for misdirected communication is
                lack of knowledge. We suggest that believers learn about a half
                a dozen salvation verses to use during witnessing. They should
                learn to stress the difference between religion and a personal
                relationship with Christ. The use of contemporary language, not
                churchy or theological words, is also helpful. Study in cell
                group what words are churchy and which are evocative.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">3. Believers should be able to explain the testimony
                of their own conversion. Many believers find it necessary to
                write out for themselves a one-page personal testimony with appropriate
                content, and learn it. The following is a good outline:</font>
            <ul>
              <ul>
                <p><font size="+1">a) Your life before you met Christ.</font></p>
                <p><font size="+1">b) How and why you received Christ.</font></p>
                <p><font size="+1">c) The specific changes that have occurred
                    in your life since then. Key words such as purpose, meaning,
                    direction, loneliness, fears, etc., should be considered
                    and remembered.</font></p>

    <p><font size="+1">V. Teaching Things to Avoid in Witnessing</font> 
    </b></font>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <p><font size="+1">A. Postmodern hearers expect and demand that we show &quot;respect&quot; to
            other world views and religions. Any suggestion that we know something
            is right while others are wrong will be interpreted as arrogance
            and will give offense. How will you teach your group to respond to
            these new conditions in postmodern America? Consider an exercise
            based on quick response to <a href="pomoevang.html">typical postmodern
            comments</a>.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">B. Make sure your people have learned to avoid argumentation
            and direct negation where possible, at the same time that they avoid
            compromise in witnessing. Do they allow the other person to express
            his/her own views, and do they truly understand the view of the other?
            Experienced evangelists know that argumentation and put-downs don't
            help, but rather hinder witnessing except in rare cases. (When might
            a good argument be warranted?) However, we would err if we assume
            that the inexperienced know this. In addition, they have to learn
            to avoid argumentation in some way other than failing to make their
            points. This ability is very difficult for some to grasp. </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">C. Think through with your group what might be some
            good ways to practice Socratic witnessing (witnessing through questions
            rather than declarations). What are some questions that are more
            or less always safe and good?</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">D. Shame and defensiveness on the part of a believer
            will ruin his/her witness. How can we cause our disciples to have
            the outlook Paul had in Rom. 1:16 and I Cor. 1:18ff? Are they able
            to express openness without fear? They have to be convinced of the
            truth in order to convince others. They should not project that they
            expect rejection and should not take rejection personally. How can
            these qualities be taught?</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">E. Teach people to avoid the appearance of condemnation
            and self-righteousness (see Phil. 4:5). It is not enough to point
            out that non-Christians are turned off if they sense judgment from
            Christians. It is also necessary to point out that the secular person
            is expecting judgment, and will misinterpret statements sometimes
            unless we take care to demonstrate love! Genuine warmth and acceptance
            are absolutely essential. How can we ensure that our disciples have
            the ability to do this?</font></p>

    <p><b><font size="+1">VI. The Subjective Witness of the Body</font> </b> 
    </font>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <p><font size="+1">A. To maximize the corporate witness of the church,
            we need to teach clearly the reasons for resorting to a corporate
            witness.</font>
        <ul>
          <ul>
            <p><font size="+1">1. In Jn. 13:34,35 and Jn. 17:21,23, Jesus stated
                that the unity and love Christians express to each other is compelling
                evidence of the truthfulness of Christianity. Since this evidence
                is more subjective than objective, it has to be felt and seen,
                rather than explained. The atmosphere produced by a group of
                Christians who love each other will often do as much to convince
                the nonbeliever to respond to Christ (especially initially) as
                the teaching he hears. A scriptural example of this is Andrew
                (Jn. 1:40- 51; Jn. 12:20-26). Andrew brought many to Christ by
                asking them to investigate Christ for themselves. (See also I
                Cor. 14:23-25)</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">2. In the event that a Christian is involved in
                a very dynamic group that is actually practicing body life principles,
                it would be foolish to ignore that avenue of witness. For this
                reason, it is sometimes (but not always) wise to invite a questioner
                to a fellowship or teaching meeting even before having spoken
                the Gospel.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">3. Another reason is that we may only get 5 or
                10 minutes at work or school to try to explain the gospel, which
                is difficult. Such a small amount of time is rarely as effective
                as a full-length, well reasoned teaching. It should, however,
                be possible even in a few minutes, to make certain statements
                of a suggestive character that will create curiosity even though
                they do not answer all of the questions. Teach people to be creative
                in devising such statements.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">4. Finally, there are varieties of gifts in the
                church, and the biblical Christian will look for opportunities
                to derive help from other gifted people. Teach your members to
                call ahead to good evangelists to arrange for help with a guest,
                or to bring it up at a prayer meeting.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">5. This witness of the Body probably won't work
                too well if your meeting lacks enthusiasm (see above, II, G.)</font></p>

        <ul>
          <ul>
            <p><font size="+1">1. The best inviters are very matter-of-fact in
                saying that they are a part of an interesting Christian group
                that they would like the other to check out sometime. All dishonesty
                or &quot;bait and switch&quot; tactics should obviously be avoided.
                At the same time, it is correct to point out that there is no
                pressure at the meeting: the people are nice, there is an interesting
                talk by a good speaker, and afterwards the people go out together
                if they want to, etc. We need to point out that some of our people
                will be surprised at how many are interested in such an invitation,
                especially if the Christian has been perceived as an appealing
                person already.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">2. It is very desirable when appropriate, to offer
                to pick someone up rather than expecting him/her to come alone.
                People are usually unwilling to go to a strange place alone.
                If they are driving themselves, they should have a good map.
                Consider meeting people for dinner before home church or Central
                Teaching.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">3. Christians need to be willing to socialize
                with non-Christians. This is directly implied in Christ's command
                that we not only &quot;love them that love us&quot;(Mt. 5:46,47).
                Also, if we are willing to accept invitations from others (to
                a movie, game, party, etc.), they will often be more willing
                to accept one from us. Remember that this means time must be
                allocated in our people's schedules for socializing with non-Christians.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">4. A person who is cynical, or very cognitively
                oriented, or who is afraid of being cornered by a small group
                of people, should be invited to a Central Meeting. Such meetings
                avoid a lot of Christian activities (singing, sharing, etc.)
                which might be menacing to certain people. People also enjoy
                more anonymity at the large meeting, so they tend to feel less &quot;on
                the spot&quot;.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">5. The Home Church is geared towards someone who
                has nothing against Christians or Christ, or who would appreciate
                the intimacy of a smaller group.</font></p>

    <p><font size="+1">VII. Concluding Considerations</font> 
    </b></font>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <p><font size="+1">A. Is it possible that people are equipped for evangelism,
            but that they are not motivated to do so? Thinking both theologically
            and practically, what motivates people to do evangelism? If negative
            momentum has built up on this point, how can the leadership turn
            the tide in the outlook of the Church?</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">B. Perhaps there is adequate outreach in the church,
            but new people are not followed up adequately? Be sure you are not
            beating the wrong drum! Check the numbers. There are study materials
            available on <a href="hcfoll.htm">Home Church follow-up</a>.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">C. If we have not cultivated a grateful attitude in
            the church, our people will probably not appreciate the things that
            God does do. Remind your people that God is answering your prayers
            and lead them in thanking Him. Evangelism comes to evangelism. That
            is, when people feel the church is victorious, they have better morale
            and witness more. Excitement is contagious.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">D. In a situation where little successful evangelism
            has occurred for a long time, and yet eventually a new convert is
            won, remember: this may be the opening we have been waiting for.
            Such a convert probably has a complete circle of close and casual
            friends that are warm medium relationships. It is essential that
            such an opportunity not be squandered by any one of the common ways. <br>
          <br>
          </font>
        <ul>
          <ul>
            <p><font size="+1">1. Sometimes the Church is overanxious to get
                the new person to do their work for them. In this situation,
                people might clumsily call on the new convert to go witness to
                his/her friends, without any theological under-girding, or without
                the rudimentary growth that sometimes must precede any desire
                on the part of the new person to bring others.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">2. Sometimes several friends are brought around,
                but they are not followed up by the mature Christians, and do
                not reappear. This is natural, because the new convert is not
                able to give satisfying answers to the guests. They should have
                been given help by older Christians. Eventually, a good church
                will win whole affinity groups, as they did in Acts 16:31ff. </font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">3. Sometimes the leaders fail to teach outreach,
                and monopolize the schedule of the new convert to the point that
                he/she loses contact with old friends. Instead, the mature believers
                should realize their opportunity to do low end work, and should
                accompany the new believer to parties, sports activities, etc.
                in order to meet his/her friends. It is often best to go to these
                events with no other intention than to meet and make friends
                with the group. If the gospel comes up, be ready. If it doesn't,
                let the new believer explain it later.</font></p>
            <p><font size="+1">4. Sometimes the church has adopted a &quot;fortress&quot; mentality,
                and sees its main goal as sealing the new convert away from his/her
                friends, especially those of the opposite sex. In this way, it
                is hoped to &quot;protect&quot; the convert from temptation.
                The best protection from temptation is to win those same friends,
                rather than avoid them.</font></p>

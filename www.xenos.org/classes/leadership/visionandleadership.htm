<b>
<p> <font size="+1">What is vision?</font></p>
</b> 
<p><font size="+1">Vision has always been considered an important component 
  in leadership, both in Christian and secular circles. The term usually refers 
  to the ability leaders have to form a plan for the future and to get others 
  excited about their plan. Often, leaders have less a plan, but more of a simple 
  picture of a possible future, and let people sort out the action steps toward 
  that more general picture. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In the Bible, the word vision is more often used as an 
  encounter with God where he imparts special revelation, often intuitively,
    in  dreams, or &quot;in dark sayings.&quot; (Num. 12:6) Sometimes visions
    can be  theophanies, where God speaks directly to the visionary (Num. 12:8).
    We don't 
  necessarily see a direct connection between visions and leadership explicitly
     taught in Scripture, but we do see a general correlation&#151;most of the main
    leaders 
  in biblical times were recipients of visions. Others received visions too,
    but  were not leaders (like Isaiah and Jeremiah). But notice that Paul's
    qualifications 
  for elders and deacons say nothing about needing to have visions.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Recently, Christian literature has been referring more 
  than ever to vision as the key to effective leadership. However, these books 
  appear to be drawing as much from the new fascination with vision found in secular 
  business literature as from the Bible. I think Christians should read this literature, 
  but must also carefully ask themselves how much of the material comes from the 
  Bible, from common sense, from pragmatics, or from New Age concepts of imaging 
  or visionizing. This last stream is based on the belief that because of the 
  mind's latent power, merely picturing a result may cause it to become real.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If we combine the biblical notion of a vision with the common 
  sense idea of leaders selling people on their directions, we can imagine a hybrid 
  notion of leadership vision. That is, leadership vision is a picture of a better 
  future for a group or individual, informed by the principles of Scripture, and 
  possibly supplemented by direct communication from God. In other words, we can 
  always know in general what God wants for the church because the Bible tells 
  us God's will. On the other hand, God will often supply a special spin on that 
  direction based on local conditions and personalities. Leaders seek out these 
  supplemental insights during times of prayer and reflection.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">While I would argue that vision is a useful tool for leaders, 
  I do not see any warrant in Scripture for saying leaders have to be visionaries. 
  We see that key leaders like Moses, Abraham, Paul, David, and Peter all received 
  visions. However, as noted above, when Paul discusses the requirements for leaders, 
  he includes no mention of visions, and focuses on character instead. Probably 
  high-level leaders or pioneering leaders are usually visionaries, but others 
  can lead as well. Non-visionary leaders often work together with visionary leaders. 
  They lead by their example and by persuasion, usually in accord with someone 
  else's vision, and this makes team leadership feasible. Interestingly, the emphasis 
  on vision as the key to leadership in today's leadership literature often leads 
  those same authors to reject the concept of team leadership in favor of the 
  single leader. I think the ability to sell a vision (here in the simple sense 
  of a picture of a possible future) is part of all leading, whether the vision 
  is my own or another's.</font></p>
<font size="5"><b>
<p><font size="+1">How do leaders get vision?</font></p>
</b></font> 
<p><font size="+1">In my experience, leaders do not have direct control over whether 
  they have vision. Notice that the Bible gives no guidance on how to receive 
  a vision. Instead, visions from God appear to be gifts given at his discretion. 
  A sense of vision for the future seems to come to leaders most often in the 
  context of their Bible study, their prayer, and their reflection about a group 
  or individual. It seems that God stimulates the leader's imagination at certain 
  times to see a desirable future. This often happens during times of prayer, 
  but also could happen, for instance, while listening to another person teach. 
  Sometimes such pictures may come unexpectedly at strange times, and even during 
  sleep.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Leaders should definitely ask God to give them a vision for 
  any individual with whom they work, not to mention for their group. It may be 
  that we already know where our group should head, but lack excitement about 
  that goal. We could call this a lack of vision. Therefore, we are often seeking 
  not just information, but a sense of urgency and passion about goals we already 
  know are right. And this sense of excitement often results from imagining the 
  future as it might develop if people follow God's will, or if they fail to do 
  so. This suggests leaders need both a positive and a negative vision of the 
  future.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To deliver this inner sense of excitement God can use 
  a number of stimuli besides the Bible and prayer. As a leader, you may want 
  to expose yourself to some of these, but always with a critical perspective.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1"><b>Visiting other churches or ministries</b>. 
        These often have ideas that are new and may become part of your vision. 
        At other times, being in the presence of another model of ministry will 
        stimulate us to a sense of vision that has nothing to do with the way 
        that group does things. In other words, the mere presence of different 
        approaches seems to stimulate a creative part of our own mind, even though 
        our conclusions may be antithetical to the conclusions reached by the 
        group we are visiting. Indeed, seeing another group may serve to remind 
        us why we do things the other way. Always beware of imitating other ministries. 
        Take the time to discover whether their approach is compatible with your 
        own, and remember that groups tend to recount their own ministries in 
        ways that are idealized and stripped of ugliness.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1"><b>Church History.</b> Like other contemporary churches, 
        church history is never authoritative. We may take parts and pieces from 
        different movements in church history while deploring other parts. Many 
        of the best ideas have been around at other times in history, and seeing 
        how God has used such ideas can stir us with excitement and a thirst to 
        try our own hand. Watch for author bias, left out material, and problems 
        that accompanied various movements. Correlate independent sources in order 
        to check on the accuracy of any account. Don't forget to include the New 
        Testament church in your study, and try to assess other movements in light 
        of the example God gave us in the Bible.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1"><b>Christian or secular biographies. </b>The stories 
        of great men and women are known to fire our imagination and desire to 
        emulate them or avoid their errors. These biographies (especially the 
        ones about missionaries and Christian leaders) are often inaccurate and 
        idealized. It is impossible, for instance, to know how much lust, anxiety, 
        egotism, or bitterness was in the heart of a great missionary, so these 
        parts are left out to one extent or another. Some biographies make it 
        seem like these Christians never did anything but pray and witness. Nevertheless, 
        these books are fun to read and stimulating. Be careful not to go too 
        far in comparing yourself with the idealized biographical characters, 
        becoming defeated as a result.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1"><b>Hanging around other visionaries.</b> 
        Known visionaries are an important resource to the church. We may not 
        agree with them or want to go the same direction, but we may still find 
        that just listening to them jogs our own mind and spirit in a positive 
        way. Whether these are leaders of other churches, or other home churches, 
        look for opportunities to hang around with a known visionary once in awhile. 
        Again, be sure you aren't just aping a ministry approach that is not compatible 
        with the foundation you have already laid with personnel in your group, 
        or with conditions in your own field of ministry.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1"><b>Doing a strength and weakness assessment or a 
        force-field analysis of your own group.</b> Doing the hard 
        work of assessing our present state is often the occasion for God to stimulate 
        a new vision for the future. We often suffer from a sense of confusion 
        about where we are at the moment, and I find that such confusion effectively 
        stifles new vision. Only when we are confident that we have a relatively 
        good grip on the present, will we trust our impressions about the future. 
        Strive for realism in this assessment, leaning against any personal tendencies 
        you may have to be overly optimistic or negative. I like doing this in 
        a small group of trusted colleagues.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1"><b>For group vision, spend time with lost people 
        in your field of ministry.</b> As we hang around lost people, 
        we are better able to empathize and imagine what they would find appealing 
        or at least palatable. Some of our best ideas for fishing come while we 
        are standing in the stream. Christian leaders who rarely hang out with 
        non-Christians and in sinful situations often come up with corny visions 
        that turn off the lost. While at a bar or rock concert, pray to God, &quot;How 
        can we reach these people?<b>&quot;</b></font></p>
      <p> <font size="+1"><b>Go over a journal or other historical materials
             (including pictures) of your own ministry.</b> I find that 
        reviewing earlier periods in my ministry often causes me to &quot;recapture&quot; 
        some aspect of vision that has slipped away. Pictures of former associates
         and groups can take you back to a spirit and tone you may have forgotten.
        
        Jesus calls on the Ephesians to &quot;remember the former things and
        repent  and do the deeds you did at first.&quot; (Rev. 2:5) Some authors
        warn against trying to relive the past, and we can see why that is never
        possible.
        But we can reacquire ethos and pathos from the past if we adapt our methods
        to present conditions.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">After you begin to feel a sense of vision, the next step 
  is to verify it. Spend time praying about it and reading supporting materials, 
  including anything the Bible has to say on the subject. As you reflect over 
  a period of time, God will tend to weaken or strengthen your conviction. Beware 
  of thinking that others can tell you whether your vision is of God. By being 
  a visionary, you are moving out ahead of others. They may resist change or risk, 
  preferring the status quo. Of course a theological or ethical critique from 
  others is perfectly valid to the extent it is based on solid biblical grounds.</font></p>
<font size="5"><b>
<p><font size="+1">How does a leader propagate vision?</font></p>
</b></font> 
<p><font size="+1">I believe a &quot;shock-wave&quot; method is best when 
  propagating vision. By shock wave, I mean that the leader begins by sharing
     her vision with her inner circle, usually by one-on-one communication. Only
    
  when your closest colleagues are convinced do you move to the next ring out&#151;the
   committed believers in your ministry. Finally, more public appeals will be
  effective, 
  now backed by a strong consensus among the opinion leaders in the group. Bruce
   Powers' <i>Christian Leadership</i> has excellent insight into this process.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This communication should include not only what you see, but 
  why it is a logical outgrowth of biblical teaching, or at least compatible with 
  biblical teaching. Another important component is why you think the vision applies 
  to your own group, or the life of the individual with whom you are sharing. 
  To argue that the vision applies to your group, you have to show how it relates 
  to past realities in the group, and why it should be attainable. For instance, 
  &quot;We see x, y, and z in the New Testament church, and we realize we have 
  the same Holy Spirit they did, etc.&quot; and at the same time, &quot;We have 
  seen something similar to this in our own ministry before and we are already 
  seeing some parts of this successfully carried out.&quot; We need to show that 
  we have always held values that accord with the vision. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">C</font><font size="+1">onvincing our people that our vision 
  is attainable may be the hardest part of the leadership process. As you share 
  theology (the power of God) and experience (things you and they have seen before) 
  you must point out why your vision is not too far-fetched. As you plead your 
  case that, &quot;We've already seen this, so there's no reason we wouldn't see 
  that,&quot; your listeners should be saying to themselves, &quot;He's got a 
  point!&quot; </font></p>
<table width="81%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="48%"><font size="+1">Good visionary leading stretches people's 
      credulity just the right amount. They should feel challenged by the immensity 
      of your vision, without feeling hopeless about attaining it. We look for 
      a point where two lines converge: the line between the banal and the amazing 
      (or from commonplace to exceptional) and the line between people's confidence 
      and skepticism.</font></td>
    <td width="52%"><img src="../../graphics/buyin.gif" width="281" height="275"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="48%"><img src="../../graphics/buyin1.gif" width="281" height="275"></td>
    <td width="52%"><font size="+1">Where these two imaginary lines intersect 
      is the &quot;buy-in&quot; zone, where people mentally and emotionally buy
      into the vision. They must feel that your vision is both bold enough to
      be worthwhile&#151;even inspiring, and yet probably, or at least possibly doable 
      within the current situation. Some who doubt will hang around to see if 
      it happens. Others must embrace the vision as fully doable and pitch in 
      to accomplish it.</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><font size="+1">You will need to spend time customizing your vision to the 
  different individuals with whom you lead. How will the new situation affect 
  them? What would be the advantages? Why are they well-suited to the kind of 
  role you are describing? Be ready to respond to possible dangers others may 
  suggest. Why are the risks reasonable and manageable?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Also, good leaders spend time thinking about how to &quot;frame&quot; 
  their vision. They are able to picture the fulfillment in terms that are appealing 
  to others, and usually also juxtapose their positive vision with a negative 
  vision, or antithesis, that will apply if they fail to attain the vision. This 
  negative future would be odious to their people. Illustrations, metaphors, and 
  powerfully emotionally evocative pictures help to create emotional arousal in 
  connection with your vision. (See how Jesus gave antithetical metaphorical pictures 
  of the future in his pictures of the houses built on sand or on the rock in 
  Mat. 7:24-27, and many other examples).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Of course, all the rhetoric in the world won't make an unreliable 
  person seem trustworthy. Christian leaders are able to persuade and excite others 
  about their vision roughly in proportion to how much people perceive them as 
  trustworthy. Trustworthiness in Christian leaders is related to their honesty, 
  their consistency, their willingness to sacrifice self, and their humility. 
  Christian leaders caught in the act of self-aggrandizement deserve to lose trust, 
  while those who work hard at empowering others deserve confidence, according 
  to Jesus (Mk. 10:42-45).</font></p>

<p align="left"><b><font size="+1">Christian leaders have to function in a number 
  of areas, and different leaders will perform better in some areas than others. 
  Leaders should appraise their own strengths and weaknesses, not hesitating to 
  get help in their weak areas when possible. At the same time, all leaders need 
  to be ready in principle to perform in all of these areas on occasion. </font> 
  </b></p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li><b><font size="+1">Provision</font></b></li>
    <p><font size="+1">Biblical leadership includes provision. David says, &quot;The 
      Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.&quot; (Ps. 23:1) Leaders are responsible 
      to see that those in their charge are able to access provision for their 
      spiritual and personal well-being and development. Note this does not mean 
      leaders must provide all nourishment themselves, though they will naturally 
      provide much of it. Followers are responsible to go and take available provision 
      for themselves provided leaders have shown them where and how to take advantage 
      of a given resource. Here analogies like that used by Paul in 1 Thes. 2, 
      (of a mother nursing her baby) break down. Paul was primarily pointing to 
      his feeling of love for the Thessalonians, not how dependent they should 
      be. Part of equipping young Christians is teaching them how to go feed themselves.</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="+1">For discussion:</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="+1">What are the main areas of provision for which Christian 
      leaders should prepare?</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">What are the main background competencies needed by leaders 
      in order to deliver in this area?</font></p>
    <li><b><font size="+1">Protection</font></b></li>
    <p><font size="+1">Biblical leadership includes protection from danger. David 
      says &quot;Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall 
      fear no evil, for you are with me.&quot; (Ps. 23:4) Shepherds are useful 
      for protecting their flocks from wolves. While we are never called to eliminate 
      all dangers from the church, a well-led church is a generally secure place 
      to grow, compared to the world. Leaders should strive to see that the church 
      or ministry is relatively free of wild doctrinal aberrations, dangerous, 
      menacing people, or disruptions that make body life impossible. Leaders 
      must weigh how much freedom to leave and how much control to exercise. After 
      all, young Christians need exposure to a wide range of viewpoints as well 
      as problematic people and situations. This is real life! But if dangers 
      within or from outside the church begin to threaten their well-being, leaders 
      should act to protect. People sometimes even need to be protected from the 
      damage they may do to themselves. Protection could involve practicing church 
      discipline, personal counseling, or other kinds of oversight.</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="+1">For discussion:</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Name some typical dangers from which leaders may seek to 
      protect their groups.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Name some specific situations that would suggest limitations 
      to the idea of protection.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">What are the background competencies needed by protecting 
      leaders?</font></p>
    <li><b><font size="+1">Direction</font></b></li>
    <p><font size="+1">Biblical leadership includes direction. David says, &quot;He 
      makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside quiet waters... 
      He guides me in the paths of righteousness.&quot; (Ps. 23:2,3) The world 
      assumes people will automatically know the best direction based on following 
      their feelings. God rejects this idea, and instead advances the idea of 
      leadership and authority. In his view, we often need outside direction on 
      which way to go. Aside from what believers can learn directly from God's 
      word, or what they hear from his inner promptings, believers may at times 
      need the wisdom of fellow Christians. While any Christian may be used to 
      give direction to another, godly leaders are particularly responsible for 
      the direction of the church, and are often called on to give direction to 
      members. Certainly, a group or ministry needs leaders to suggest, or even 
      at times to insist, on a particular direction in the operation of that ministry. 
      Again, directing does not suggest that followers cannot or should not develop 
      their own ability to apply truth to their lives in a wise way. Therefore, 
      the godly leader will at times withhold her counsel and call on members 
      to decide for themselves. Only when people go wrong some of the time will 
      they develop the wisdom to avoid wrong in the future. Therefore, no leader 
      should seek to direct every aspect of a given ministry, let alone the lives 
      of those involved.</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="+1">For Discussion:</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Give some examples of issues where strong direction may 
      be needed from leaders.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Name some situations where a leader might want to refrain 
      from directing.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">What background competencies would enable a leader to be 
      a good director?</font></p>
    <li><b><font size="+1">Motivation</font></b></li>
  </ol>

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">David says, &quot;Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.&quot; 
      (Ps. 23:4) The rod and staff were used to poke and swat sheep so they keep 
      moving in the right direction, so the analogy breaks down a bit. People 
      are far more advanced than sheep, and require more sophisticated forms of 
      motivation. But we see repeated examples in the Bible of leaders awakening 
      motivation in their people. Often, God sends leaders to impart vision to 
      his people, and to bestow the gift of motivation. Note that motivating people 
      is completely different from the idea of issuing imperatives, or instructions. 
      While these may be appropriate at times, here we refer to leaders behaving 
      in such a way that others feel a sense of excitement or need to act in a 
      certain direction. Effective leaders are able to agitate and excite people 
      who were formerly dull, listless, apathetic and bored. Leaders can develop 
      and impart a vision of godly living and accomplishment that people adopt 
      as their own. After people act, good leaders know how to encourage more 
      of the same through positive words.</font></p>

      God?</font></p>

      him or her that made you feel motivated?</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Some leaders are able to excite, but it doesn't last. With 
      others, their followings have continued to eagerly follow God over the years.

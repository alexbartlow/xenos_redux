<p><font size="+1">Before considering how to motivate people, we have to 
  settle two important questions. <br>
  1) What is motivation in the Christian context? <br>
  2) What does a motivated person look like?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The answer we give to these questions will absolutely 
  limit and channel our efforts to motivate others. My suggested definition of 
  motivation is:</font></p>
<blockquote> <b>
  <p><font size="+1">People are motivated when they are <u>convinced</u> 
    of the <u>correctness</u> and the <u>urgency</u> of Christian goals to the 
    extent that they are <u>eager to act</u>, and <u>keep acting</u>, to reach 
    those goals <u>regardless of what others do or think</u>.</font></p>
  </b> </blockquote>
<p> <font size="+1">In the early stages of motivation, people may also need 
  emotional support or arousal from others to promote action. But we cannot say 
  people are motivated in the true sense unless they carry on for their own reasons, 
  with, or without support from others. Likewise, those who act without understanding 
  why they act may be motivated according to the world, but not according to the 
  Bible. Unless we work through people's understanding and consent, we may be 
  manipulating rather than motivating.</font></p>
<font size="5">
<h3><font size="+1"><b>A. Convincing people our goals are right</b></font></h3>
</font> 
<ul>
  <li><b><font face="Times" size="+1">Instruction- </font></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="+1">They must understand what our goals are, and 
          why we hold them. </font></li>
        <li><font size="+1">They should be able to articulate reasons for 
          their direction. </font></li>
        <li><font size="+1">They should understand and know Scripture that 
          teaches specifically on goals they are pursuing. </font></li>
        <li><font size="+1">Therefore, a good discipler understands the theory 
          of Christian growth and ministry at a deep level. </font></li>
        <li><font size="+1">A good motivator tells others what is right, 
          but also shows them how to discover what is right for themselves through 
          good hermeneutics and Bible study, as well as reasonable and prayerful 
          analysis of situations. </font></li>
        <li><font size="+1">Motivating others Includes wisdom in applying 
          biblical principles to their lives:</font> 
          <ul>
            <li><font size="+1">Such wisdom requires <b><i>Preparation</i></b> 
              - Motivating others requires time reflecting about the person's 
              present state and needed change. In prayer, we ask God what the 
              next steps should be in the person's life. <br>
              <br>
              </font></li>
            <li><font size="+1">A good analogy is building a fire. You don't 
              strike the match until you have gathered all the things you need&#151;kindling, 
              small sticks, larger wood. </font></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><font size="+1">We often see people doing things they don't 
          understand because of the personal magnetism of a leader. This is inadequate, 
          and dangerous, because it depends on human inspiration rather than spiritual 
          inspiration. While it might be alright for young Christians to live 
          this way, try to move quickly toward a more mature motivational base. 
          Always try to make sure people understand what they are doing and why.

</ul>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="+1">Just because the Bible teaches something doesn't 
          mean people will necessarily practice it. </font></li>
        <li><font size="+1">The skillful discipler is a persuader who is 
          able to convince others using</font> 
          <ul>
            <li><font size="+1">Good arguments </font></li>
            <li><font size="+1">Good antitheses </font></li>
            <li><font size="+1">Good illustrations </font></li>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><font size="+1">Again, we don't want to see people doing things 
          they would rather not do because of social pressure or magnetic personalities. 
          They must become convinced in their own right that God's way is best.<br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li><font size="+1"><b>The role of emotional arousal</b></font> <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="+1">When working with new Christians, leaders may, at 
            times, have to use techniques of emotional arousal or at least powerful 
            emotional support in order encourage action. However, I believe this 
            should only be done the first time or two that our people try something 
            new and (to them) scary. After that, leaders may use encouragement, 
            which is a form of emotional support, but even this should gradually 
            become unnecessary most of the time.</font></li>
          <li><font size="+1">Be careful not to overuse emotional arousal and 
            support techniques, because your people will have to eventually do 
            without this support in large measure. Here we see a difference between 
            duplication approaches to ministry and static, or linear growth approaches. 
            If I assume my people will more or less always be in my group, I am 
            more willing to depend on emotional arousal, because I know if they 
            need it in the future I can supply it again. But if I assume my people 
            are going to leave me and go into their own group, I have to hold 
            out for a higher level of motivation where emotional arousal or support 
            is not necessary in order to secure motivation. In other words, motivation 
            becomes internally generated, not externally stimulated.</font></li>

<h2><font size="+1">B. Convincing people of the urgency of our goals</font></h2>
</b></font> 
<ul>
  <li><font size="+1"><font face="Times"><b>Modeling:</b> </font></font></li>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="+1">Some models are followed and some are not. Why? </font></li>
        <li><font size="+1">Why do some models create more excitement for their 
          way of life than others? </font></li>
        <li><font size="+1">One reason is how much integrity people perceive in 
          a model. Models with more perceived integrity will be followed more 
          than others. </font></li>
        <li><font size="+1">People tend to follow models who have invested in 
          them more than disengaged models. We should &quot;fervently love one 
          another from the heart,&quot; according to Peter, and if we do, we will 
          be more powerful as models.</font></li>
        <li><font size="+1">Another issue is whether people perceive that a model's 
          way of life leads to reward or to punishment. Studies show that people 
          will not usually follow models they perceive as being punished for their 
          way of life. Remember, punishment is a matter of interpretation, and 
          it is possible for a leader to suffer without feeling punished.</font></li>
        <li><font size="+1">People follow models who are passionate more than 
          those who are unemotional about their way of life. Learn to put passion 
          into your life, and you will become a more influential leader. </font></li>
        <li><font size="+1">People follow models for reasons other than immediate 
          reward or personal advantage. Convincing research shows that followers 
          of strong leaders don't care about remuneration or &quot;what's in it 
          for me.&quot; They are prepared to sacrifice to an extraordinary degree, 
          partly because they perceive that their models, or leaders are prepared 
          to sacrifice themselves. This high level of commitment to Christian 
          goals, including personal sacrifice, is a key component in effective 
          modeling. </font></li>
        <li><font size="+1">Models are not followed when people lose confidence 
          in them. Loss of confidence occurs when models are discredited, not 
          necessarily when they fail. As Gallup says, &quot;People admire leaders 
          more for what they try to do than what the actually do.&quot; Dishonesty 
          or self-aggrandizement (perceived seeking of personal advantage from 
          being a leader) heavily discredit models.</font></li>

    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="+1"><b>Casting Vision - </b>We spend time imagining with 
          God how the other person could enjoy a better future&#151;This involves 
          thinking about the other when we are not with them and intercessory 
          prayer. </font></li>
        <li><font size="+1">Scripture teaches that we may have to <b>call</b> 
          people to move out on what they know is right. We cannot always assume 
          people will take hints, or draw the right conclusions. Scripture and 
          experience show that leaders need to sometimes make specific requests 
          of people before they will act. </font></li>
        <li><b><font size="+1">Challenging people indirectly</font></b><font size="+1"> 
          is evident in Christ and Paul's ministries. For instance, Paul 
          would tell about his own life and values, or point out the good works 
          of the churches in Macedonia (2 Cor. 8) </font></li>
        <li><font size="+1"><b>Modeling</b> behaviors for the purpose of influence 
          is great stimulus. Try to take your disciple out and let them see you 
          witness, or let them see how you follow up with a new person in home 
          church. </font></li>
        <li><font size="+1"><b>Reading response</b>: When challenging or calling 
          someone, the leader needs to be sensitive enough to read how they are 
          responding. Based on that response, the leader either withdraws or advances.</font> 
          <ul>
            <li><font size="+1">Returning to our analogy of building a fire, we 
              see a fair comparison. A small fire that is sputtering should not 
              have more fuel added. Only when we sense the fire is advancing do 
              we add more and larger sticks. Likewise, leaders learn to move toward 
              responsiveness with more ideas for progressing, and to retreat from 
              unresponsiveness. <br>

    <br>
    </font></li>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="+1">When we encourage those who are already moving along 
          lines that will result in spiritual growth, it shows the importance 
          we place on these goals, and adds to the person's emotional strength 
          to continue </font></li>
        <li><font size="+1">Encouragement is highly effective in sustaining action, 
          but far less so at initiating action.</font></li>
        <li><font size="+1">We should never miss an opportunity to encourage in 
          the early stages of action in any desirable direction. However, within 
          a fairly short period we should move to only periodic encouragement. 
          This is because periodic encouragement is actually more effective than 
          consistent encouragement (an intermittent, or variable interval reinforcement).</font></li>
        <li><font size="+1">Devise different ways to encourage:</font> 
          <ul>
            <li><font size="+1">Indirectly by mobilizing others (someone comments 
              that a person's comment at home church was helpful, and you urge 
              them to tell the person)</font></li>
            <li><font size="+1">Publicly. To express admiration in the presence 
              of others has far more effect than doing so privately.</font></li>
            <li><font size="+1">Mentioning specific details that were impressive 
              leaves a stronger impression.</font></li>
            <li><font size="+1">Reserving encouragement for actual progress, not 
              for routine accomplishment</font></li>
            <li><font size="+1">Encouragement in writing seems to have special

        <li><font size="+1">When people continue to act but are no longer 
          reinforced much, a crisis may result. The person begins to wonder why 
          they are living this way if no one appreciates it. This crisis may be 
          very acute if most of their motivation has been based on human emotional 
          support, or if they have little understanding of why they do what they 
          do, or if they have little personal conviction </font></li>
        <li><font size="+1">At this point, we may need to enter into a counseling 
          process to help the person understand his or her own feelings as they 
          shift away from a wrong to a right motivational base. This period really 
          involves a weaning process where people learn to live based on what 
          God wants rather than for social reasons. </font></li>

<p><font size="+1">When our people are motivated in a thorough and biblical way, 
  rather than a superficial way based on &quot;monkey see, monkey do&quot; or 
  a fad mentality, true duplication and group replication become possible. But 
  if we depend on sociological manipulation, people will lose their motivation 
  the minute we let them out of our sight, and we will not dare to release them 
  into their own ministries.</font></p>

<p>A successful Home Church must maintain the unity of its leaders. Disunited leaderships
are incapable of leading Home Church growth. The strength of sharing in the leader's
meeting often directly affects the quality of Home Church meetings. Strong Home Churches
nearly always have leaderships with skilled encouragers and visionaries on board. For all
these reasons, it is essential that Home Church leaders learn to deal with their conflicts
maturely and quickly. When working with fellow leaders, the following considerations are
helpful. 

<ol>
  <ol>
    <font face="Times">
    <li>Encouraging fellow leaders</li>
    </font><ol type="a"><font face="Times">
      </font>
      <li>Can you name personal characteristics you admire in each of your fellow leaders? If not,
        you need to spend time with God pleading for a more realistic and fair assessment of your
        colleagues.</li>
      <li>Can you name other leaders' accomplishments you appreciate for each leader? Again, pray
        for your eyes to be opened, and for the humility to admit others' value to the ministry.</li>
      <li>Have you articulated any of these points to your fellow leaders in person during the
        past two months? If not, you are grossly tardy in your encouraging role. They will find
        criticisms and advice hard to accept from you if you are weak in encouragement.</li>
      <li>Pray for vision for each of your fellow leaders. Ask God to show you why their unique
        contribution is important. Then look for an opportunity to express your vision to each in
        a non-showy and realistic fashion.</li>
      <li>Pray together for each other. Make your prayer times opportunities to review what God
        has bestowed on the church through each of your leaders, not just a time for fretting and
        problem solving.</li>
    </ol>
    <font face="Times">
    <li>Resolving Personal Conflicts</li>
    </font><ol type="a"><font face="Times">
      </font>
      <li>Take time to spell out and resolve conflicts as they arise. Help each other resolve
        personal problems.</li>
      <li>Encourage each other whenever possible. Controversy needs to be balanced with
        encouragement, kindness, and approval.</li>
      <li>Take time for positive social relating with other leaders. Spending time with your
        fellow leaders should be a priority</li>
      <li>If an unresolvable problem arises, seek help from the office. </li>
      <li>Leaders should agree on a realistic, hard-working standard for Home Church leadership.
        Leaders who are not living by such a standard should be criticized to their face, rather
        than behind their back, and challenged to step up.</li>
      <li>If you feel you must offer criticism to a fellow leader, your perception of any
        shortcomings on the part of other leaders should be objective, and serious. Avoid picking
        at each other for unimportant issues, which leads to a critical atmosphere.</li>
      <li>Observing the principle of the &quot;man on the Spot&quot;.</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
</ol>

<ol type="i">
  <ol type="i">
    <ol type="i">
      <ol type="i">
        <li>You should exercise extreme caution when you encounter negative thoughts regarding
          another leader's ministry work, especially if that work is carried on outside of your own
          cell. This is because the man (or woman) on the spot is the one who is usually best able
          to judge what is happening.<br>
          <br>
          The value of other leaders in this situation is mainly that of <u>questioning</u> the
          situation, rather than <u>defining</u> it. In other words, by a questioning process, the
          other leaders should bring out any doubts that they have about the ministry of the one on
          the spot. However, if the answers given are sensible and correspond with objective fact,
          they should be believed. Also, if a leader contradicts an account given by a member, we
          should be disposed to believe the leader over the member, according to I Timothy 5:19.<br>
          <br>
          It will often be necessary to re-asses your impression after talking to the one on the
          spot. If doubt lingers, you should usually keep it to yourself until the situation is
          completely clarified. <br>
          <br>
          Leaders should be very wary of tendencies found in most people to second guess other
          workers, and to feel that &quot;I know best.&quot; We should be very reluctant to meddle
          in the decision making process of the leadership of another cell <u>beyond questioning
          those leaders</u>.</li>
        <li>All leaders should however, submit to questioning of their ministry by other leaders--
          even questioning of a close nature. It is by being questioned that we re-examine our own
          position, and thus benefit from other leaders. <br>
          <br>
          A leader who refuses to be questioned, or who takes offense at being questioned is
          displaying an immature attitude that contradicts team leadership. Such refusal becomes an
          issue in itself, and must be resolved before a reasonable level of cooperation can be
          expected. While any leader may react defensively at first, we have no excuse for
          continuing in such a posture.<br>
          <br>
          Don't withdraw from a leader who flares up when questioned. This problem won't go away,
          and must be resolved at any cost. Get help from the office if needed.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
  </ol>
</ol>

<ol type="a">
  <ol type="a">
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
      <u>Commitment to success</u>. Each Home Church leader should commit his/herself to the goal
        of seeing real success in the work of all of the <u>other</u> leaders. Unless we can
        honestly affirm that this is our goal, nothing we say is reliable.</li>
      <li>
      <u>Communicating Respect</u> Other leaders should be viewed as colleagues, and treated with
        all due respect. There should be an assumption of basic competence, and this should be
        communicated in the demeanor and the words used in a Home Church leaders' meeting. How is
        respect communicated?</li>
      <li>
      <u>Large Leadership Meetings</u>. It is usually a good idea to have a Home Church leaders'
        meeting chaired by one of the older leaders. Chairing a meeting does not connote any
        superiority of position, it is only done for the sake of order and direction in the
        meeting.</li>
      <li>
      <u>Focusing the ministry</u>. Unless the leaders are all focusing the majority of their
        attention and efforts on work that is needed and effective, frustration and negativity
        will inevitably result. Ascertain whether the bulk of leaders' and workers' time and
        effort is being used to focus on problems, or on positive, strategically sound ministry.<br>
        <br>
        Follow the principle of focusing on the responsive field. Within each ministry sphere,
        identify the most promising and responsive people at this particular time. Avoid the three
        most common errors in this area: </li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
</ol>

<ol type="i">
  <ol type="i">
    <ol type="i">
      <ol type="i">
        <li>trying to force feed a believer (or non-Christian) who does not want it.</li>
        <li>ignoring good growing Christians, because they are doing alright.</li>
        <li>greasing the squeaky wheel-- expending all of the work of the church (and all of the
          discussion time in leader's meeting) on people who demand and complain the loudest,
          without considering others who may demand less, but who are more promising.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
  </ol>
</ol>

<ol>
  <ol>
    <font face="Times"><li>
    <u>Dealing with Negativity</u>. Every leadership team and every leader have to deal with
      negativity and defeatism from time to time. These attitudes are damaging in the extreme to
      the morale of the Home Church and the workforce. When dealing with negativity, remember
      the following. </li>
    </font><ol type="a"><font face="Times">
      </font>
      <li>Distinguish between negativity and realism. The admission of authentic problems is
        essential before they can be resolved. However, every problem area should be appraised
        without exaggeration, and the power of God to work through the situation should be
        expressly admitted.</li>
      <li>Leaders need to remind each other that Christian work, like all war, is full of
        reversals and unexpected misfortune. Yet there are unexpected victories as well! The
        setbacks we see today should be seen in the light of the overall history of God's working
        with the Home Church. It is usually easy to see that there have been periodic reversals,
        but overall progress.</li>
      <li>Negativity regarding other leaders' ministries is particularly suspicious (see VII,A,2
        above-- the man on the spot).</li>
      <li>We should try to verbally balance negative facts with positive ones in the leader's
        meeting. It is common to have most of the people in the Home Church earnestly seeking
        growth, but to focus on the few who are uninterested, or in defeat.</li>
      <li>A leader who is projecting negativity and defeatism in the leaders meeting should be
        reminded to express faith in God.</li>
      <li>When real problems arise, are the leaders only bemoaning the situation, or are they also
        creating steps to correct the situation? If no steps are possible, it is usually unwise to
        spend much time discussing that particular situation.</li>

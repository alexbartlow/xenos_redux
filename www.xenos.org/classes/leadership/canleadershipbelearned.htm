    <p><font size="+1">I want to share what I have learned through the years about 
      leading without the gift of leadership.</font></p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<b><font size=4>
<p><font size="+1">Distinguish between the gift of leadership and the office of 
  leader.</font></p>
</font></b> 
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">There is a difference between these two, and if you don't 
    understand this and remember it, you will get in trouble.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<dir> 
  <dir> 
    <p><font size="+1">The <i>gift of leadership</i> is a spiritual gift recognized 
      by things like: <br>
      - naturally sees where to go; <br>
      - likes trying new things; <br>
      - likes the responsibility of making important and difficult decisions; 
      <br>
      - easily gains confidence of people without having personal relationship 
      with them; <br>
      - thinks fast and well on his feet; etc.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">The <i>office of leader</i> is a role in the church. The 
      New Testament speaks of two such offices--elder and deacon. In addition, 
      we see certain people charged with providing leadership for local churches 
      until elders are appointed (e.g., Titus and Timothy).</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">The point is that <i>the office does not necessarily require 
      the gift</i>. I say this for several reasons:</font></p>
    <dir> 
      <dir> 
        <p><font size="+1">1. There is no leadership gifting mentioned in the 
          elder and deacon requirements in 1 Timothy and Titus.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">2. Paul appoints people like Timothy, who clearly was 
          not a gifted leader, to lead in Ephesus. In fact, I think that Timothy 
          is our model and Paul's advice to Timothy includes most of the keys 
          to leading effectively when you're not a gifted leader.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">3. Experience shows that God's work requires many leaders, 
          and in his sovereign wisdom he has not handed out the gift of leadership 
          to fill all (or even most) of those needed roles.</font></p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p><font size="+1">I do not have any great gift of leadership. All the way 
      back to before I was a Christian, I would say that I have had the ability 
      to lead others, but not the natural gifting or temperament to do so. For 
      as long as I can remember, I have felt most comfortable letting others set 
      direction and then working with them to accomplish the goal. I tend to only 
      assume leadership when I sense that no one else will do so; then my desire 
      for closure and direction motivates me to set direction so we can get going. 
      I also will do a good job when I am put in charge of a project. But I am 
      not a natural visionary, so I don't naturally see what needs to be done 
      or where groups of people should head.</font></p>
    <dir> 
      <dir> 
        <p><font size="+1">Yet I believe God calls on me to lead in a number of 
          areas. He clearly wants me to lead my family. He also wants me to lead 
          in this church, both as an elder and as a home group leader. God's work 
          requires many leaders, and in his sovereign wisdom he has not handed 
          out the gift of leadership to fill all (or even most) of those needed 
          roles. I believe I can do a reasonably good job at leadership, as long 
          as I look to him for help and "play within myself."</font></p>

<b><font size=4> </font></b><b><font size=4>
<p><font size="+1">Beware of comparing yourself with gifted leaders.</font></p>
</font></b> 
<dir>
  <dir> 
    <p><font size="+1">I think it's pretty common for those in the office of leader 
      to unconsciously begin to assume that they should be gifted leaders, and 
      then to compare themselves with gifted leaders. When this happens, bad things 
      happen.</font></p>
    <dir> 
      <dir> 
        <p><font size="+1">You can become vulnerable to accusation that you are 
          unqualified for the role. The more you buy into this, the less effective 
          you will be.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">You can become vulnerable to accusation about the gifted 
          leader(s) you're comparing yourself to.</font></p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p><font size="+1">Instead, thank God for the gifted leaders we have and for 
      the privilege of working with them. Reaffirm to yourself and to God that 
      he hasn't gifted you this way and therefore he doesn't expect you to be 
      like them. Reaffirm what you have to offer (see below) and that God will 
      use you to help grow his church.</font></p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<b><font size=4>
<p><font size="+1">Remember the two most important factors that don't have to 
  do with leadership gifting.</font></p>
</font></b> 
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">In his letters to Timothy, Paul wanted Timothy to focus 
      on what he had to offer these people, not on what he didn't have. These 
      two factors were1) his example of godly living and 2) his knowledge of God's 
      Word. In 1&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;4, this is what Paul reminds "intimidated" Timothy 
      of (see 1&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;4:12 for example and 4:13 for the Word). He does 
      this again in 2&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;2:19-22 (example), 2:24-26 and 3:16-4:2 (Word). 
      </font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<dir> 
  <dir> 
    <p><font size="+1">PERSONAL EXAMPLE: Younger Christians need models of relative 
      spiritual maturity. If they want to grow spiritually, they will profit immensely 
      from being able to rub shoulders with people who have godly character, practice 
      sacrificial love, keep trusting God for new things (later), and have built 
      a lifestyle centered around serving the Lord.</font></p>
    <dir> 
      <dir> 
        <p><font size="+1">This is why Peter says to elders, "&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;proving 
          to be examples of the flock&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;" (1&nbsp;Pet.&nbsp;5:3). 
          This is why the author of the Hebrews says, "Remember those who led 
          you, who spoke the word of God to you; and considering the result of 
          their conduct, imitate their faith." (Heb. 13:7).</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">Think about those who have made a great impact on your 
          spiritual lives. Most of them were probably not great visionaries, but 
          they inspired you by their example and they showed you practically how 
          to pray, trust God, share your faith, love others, etc.</font></p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p><font size="+1">BIBLICAL KNOWLEDGE: By definition, to lead other Christians 
      means telling them what God wants. To the best of our ability, we've got 
      to dish it out by teaching the whole counsel of God (Acts&nbsp;20:27), by 
      answering people's questions, by helping people see how it applies to their 
      present situations, etc. We have to cultivate confidence that God's Word 
      has the power to change people long-term in ways that force of personality, 
      pressure, etc. cannot accomplish.</font></p>
    <dir> 
      <dir> 
        <p><font size="+1">Again, if you think back to those who have impacted 
          you the most, you will find that such biblical knowledge is a common 
          feature.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">You have to be a life-long learner of God's truth. 
          This is why Sanders says good leaders are readers. God can develop this 
          in you, even if you had a poor education, poor study habits, etc. but 
          you have to want it, pray for it, and cooperate with him in building 
          it.</font></p>

<b><font size=4>
<p><font size="+1">Know where you are gifted, and use those strengths to enhance 
  your leadership.</font></p>
</font></b> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">In the midst of reminding Timothy to focus on setting an 
    example of godly living and communicating God's Word, he also urges him to 
    focus on his areas of gifting and keep developing in those areas (1&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;4:14,15). 
    In another passage, he says the same thing, and implies that there is a connection 
    between this and overcoming timidity (2&nbsp;Tim. 1:6,7).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<dir> 
  <dir> 
    <p><font size="+1">A good leader uses his gifts to impact the people he is 
      leading. I may have to minister in areas that I'm not gifted in, especially 
      if no one else can or will do them--but I dare not neglect focusing on the 
      areas I am gifted in. God will work through me especially in those areas 
      to impact the people and to give me more confidence to lead.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">I use my teaching and knowledge gift to draw people into 
      my home church from Central Teaching and Principles class, and to draw new 
      people in my home church to talk afterwards and challenge them to take the 
      next step (study group, ministry house, etc.). I use my encouragement gift 
      to build up the hurting and exhort people to take the next step.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">My wife uses her gifts of hospitality and counseling to 
      have a powerful leadership impact on my home church even though she rarely 
      teaches.</font></p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">What areas are you gifted in? Are you using them and developing 
    them in your home group work? Or are you ministering primarily in areas of 
    non-gifting?</font></p>
</blockquote>
<b><font size=4>
<p><font size="+1">Take advantage of gifted leaders and other experienced home 
  group workers.</font></p>
</font></b>
<dir>
  <dir> 
    <p><font size="+1">Ask those not in your group for advice. I'm always asking 
      Dennis and other gifted leaders what they would do about situations in my 
      home group. You should be full of questions during your consultations with 
      staff overseers!! What does it mean if you know you're not a gifted leader, 
      but you don't have questions for these folks?</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">If you have gifted leaders in your group, consult them 
      for vision and strategic thinking. You can do this even if they are not 
      yet ready to lead. This is not abdicating your role, and it will motivate 
      them to contribute their gifting even if they aren't yet ready for the office.</font></p>

<b><font size=4>
<p><font size="+1">Understand the distinction between discipleship and shepherding--and 
  do both.</font></p>
</font></b>
<dir>
  <dir> 
    <p><font size="+1">These are two distinct ministries. Leaders who don't understand 
      the difference make mistakes that hurt their impact.</font></p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font size="+1">Shepherding emphasizes<i> the other person's own spiritual 
      growth</i>. Though ministering to others may well come up, your main purpose 
      is in giving nurture, counsel, admonition, biblical instruction to help 
      them get established in their walks with God. Discipleship, however, emphasizes<i> 
      teaching the other person how to minister to others</i>. Personal growth 
      issues are addressed, but the main focus is on how to become an effective 
      Christian worker.</font></li>
    <li><font size="+1">Shepherding is <i>unconditional</i>--we do it freely and 
      with no expectations of reciprocal response. Discipleship, however, is <i>conditional. 
      </i>If you move into a discipleship relationship, you should make it clear 
      there will be expectations and accountability, and spell them out. Be willing 
      to step back if they won't do their part--but still love them as before. 
      This is important both for the work of discipleship and to avoid "bait and 
      switch" relationships.</font></li>
    <li><font size="+1">Shepherding is normally <i>sporadic and ongoing</i>. You 
      help people as they need it and are open to it, and as you are burdened 
      and available. Discipleship, however, is normally <i>consistent and for 
      a period of time</i>. You meet with the person on a regular basis with the 
      understanding that the day will come when they will be doing this with others.</font></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<dir> 
  <dir> 
    <p><font size="+1">This is not an "either-or" issue. Leaders are responsible 
      to "shepherd the flock of God" (1&nbsp;Pet.&nbsp;5:2), so we need to be 
      praying for insight and guidance to give to people and using the meetings 
      and other contacts to do this. But leaders are also responsible to raise 
      up other leaders (2&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;2:2), and this involves prayerfully selecting 
      a person or two, meeting with them regularly for training, and staying with 
      them until they become leaders/Servant Team members--or flake out.</font></p>
    <dir> 
      <dir> 
        <p><font size="+1">Involvement in discipleship is also very gratifying 
          because of the friendship aspect. It also helps you not to give way 
          to discouragement when things look dark, because you'll win in the long 
          run if you are raising up disciples.</font></p>

<b><font size=4>
<p><font size="+1">Invest in your people until you feel affection for them.</font></p>
</font></b>
<dir>
  <dir> 
    <p><font size="+1">Home group leadership is people-intensive. You can't sit 
      in the control tower and hand down the orders; you have to be among the 
      people, rubbing shoulders with them, getting to know them, and actually 
      feel a closeness and affection for them (in varying degrees). Some people 
      are "people persons"--others (including myself) are not. For those who aren't, 
      we need to actively cultivate this affection by investing in the people. 
      </font></p>
    <dir> 
      <dir> 
        <p><font size="+1">Affection is not something you can fake, but neither 
          is it something you can afford to not have if you want to lead effectively. 
          People sense whether you love them, and they will not follow very far 
          people who don't love them. Besides, nothing is more uncomfortable and 
          dissatisfying than being a disengaged leader--it's hypocritical and 
          you feel more and more aversive to leading. Turn it around! Get in there 
          and invest by faith, and God will enable you to feel love for the people, 
          excitement about being with them, and give more insight to how you can 
          help.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">This is what we learn about Paul in 1&nbsp;Thessalonians. 
          He had fond affection for them because they had become very dear to 
          him (2:8), and his emotional state was affected by how they were doing 
          spiritually (3:5-8). This seems to have been the result of his personal 
          investment in them (2:7,9-11).</font></p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p><font size="+1">How can you do this?</font></p>
    <dir> 
      <dir> 
        <p><font size="+1">You have to be around people a sufficient amount of 
          time. </font></p>
        <dir> 
          <p><font size="+1">This means not only attending the meetings consistently, 
            but using the time before and after to relate to people on more than 
            a superficial level. This may require prayerful reflection and writing 
            down edification goals (Heb.&nbsp;10:24). This comes more naturally 
            for gifted leaders, but the rest of us have to set aside time to do 
            this.</font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">This also means spending time telling stories, laughing 
            and enjoying one another.</font></p>
        </dir>
        <p><font size="+1">You can act on the feelings of affection you do occasionally 
          have by expressing them. As you do this, it gets easier over time. And 
          this forges deep bonds.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">You can use appropriate physical touch (see Rom.&nbsp;16:16). 
          A hug, a hand on the shoulder, etc. can communicate warmth and affection 
          very effectively.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">You can encourage and admonish when you see either 
          is needed. These interactions express genuine love, and they build affection.</font></p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p><font size="+1">QUALIFY: Those of you who have no trouble with this may 
      need to watch for the co-dependent attitude--you are so involved that your 
      emotional state is dependent on how your people are doing. If this is the 
      case, review the three roles in ministry (God's, yours, and theirs). Are 
      you able to set boundaries?</font></p>

  people you're leading.</font></p>
</font></b>
<dir>
  <dir> 
    <p><font size="+1">Gifted leaders naturally think along these lines. They 
      always have the mission in mind, and they almost instinctively sense the 
      most strategic way to get there. The rest of us have to find ways to stay 
      focused on this or we'll drift off track and forfeit the unity and momentum 
      that the group needs.</font></p>
    <dir> 
      <dir> 
        <p><font size="+1">I make sure that I enunciate the mission of my home 
          church at least quarterly at a combined study group or Leaders-Team 
          meeting. I also schedule at least an annual leaders weekend where we 
          evaluate the progress in each area of our mission. Then we report this 
          to the group so they remember the mission and see the progress.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">Our corporate prayer time accomplishes several things 
          at once: models the importance of prayer; keeps the mission in focus; 
          builds spiritual unity; communicates where people are at spiritually; 
          vulnerability enhances closeness and affection.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">As a home church leader, you are asked to fill out
            a report before you talk to a consultant in the home group department.
            This report covers things like attendance (3 part), ministry charts,
            discipleship lines, financial giving, planting plan, etc. You will
            be
          wise to use tools like this to keep your eye on the ball. </font></p>

    <p><font size="+1">Be honest when you're not succeeding. Verbalize this and 
      call on people for insight and help. Resist the fleshly tendency to hide 
      it, rationalize it, lower the bar, etc. You don't have to have the answer 
      to a problem before you communicate it at least to other leaders and workers. 
      You can raise the issue, ask people for feedback, share you r own thoughts, 
      challenge people to pray, etc.</font></p>

          the result of their conduct, imitate their <i>faith</i>." (Heb.&nbsp;13:7).</font></p>
      </dir>

    <p><font size="+1">When was the last time you followed God's prompting out 
      of your comfort zone? How do you respond when he prompts you to serve someone, 
      when he convicts you of sin, when he challenges you to share your faith, 
      or confront someone, or give your money, etc.? These steps, which no one 
      else sees but you and God, are so crucial to your own vitality and to your 
      impact on your flock.</font></p>
    <dir> 
      <dir> 
        <p><font size="+1">Beware the tendency to rest on your laurels in this 
          area! Yesterday's faith can never fight today's battles! Compare the 
          church in Sardis (Rev.&nbsp;3:2,3) to Caleb (Josh.&nbsp;14:6-12).</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Be consistent and persistent!</font></p>

    <p><font size="+1">TORTISE &amp; HARE: It's probably true what they say: Leadership 
      is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration. I will take a consistent, reliable 
      godly person who isn't gifted in leadership over a gifted leader who is 
      inconsistent ten times out of ten.</font></p>
    <dir> 
      <dir> 
        <p><font size="+1">This is probably why Paul says to Timothy, " persevere 
          in these things; for as you do this you will insure salvation both for 
          yourself and for those who hear you." (1&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;4:16), and " 
          The hard-working farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of 
          the crops." (2&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;2:6).</font></p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p><font size="+1">You don’t need to feel like you have to have some great 
      insight for people every time you speak or talk to them. If you pray for 
      your people, discharge the insight God gives you, etc., you have to bank 
      on the fact that <i>in the long run</i> God will use you to make an impact 
      in their lives.</font></p>
    <dir> 
      <dir> 
        <p><font size="+1">HUMOR: This is why I recommend that Christian workers 
          get a hobby that yields visible short-term results! Christian work is 
          slow, and much of the time we are laboring in faith without seeing tangible 
          results.</font></p>

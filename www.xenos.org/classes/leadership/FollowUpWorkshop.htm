<h3>Who should try to engage in initial follow up?</h3>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:47.0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
  general, the primary person responsible for interacting with new guests is <b>the
  person who brought them</b>. Bringers should not abandon their guests unless
  they are satisfied that others have already engaged them. New people should
  not be left alone during social times before or after meetings.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:47.0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
  most bringers are happy to have others in the home church talk to their guests,
  either together, or even instead of the bringer. This could be because the
  guest is a different gender than the bringer (especially in singles groups),
  or because the bringer has already made progress, but would now like to have
  other voices confirm what they have been saying. Typically, other members from
  the same cell group as the bringer should feel special responsibility to follow
  up guests. Those from the related men’s or women’s cell would be equally suitable.
  If a bringer wants others in their cell group to help follow up with a guest,
  the best thing to do is let them know of the need beforehand.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;

text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
  anyone who has the chance should engage new people socially in a general way,
  but with sensitivity to what others are doing. Those with proven follow up
  ability should exercise their gift aggressively, while those with less experience
  may want to watch and learn if they get the chance.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Note
  that, unlike discipleship, members should feel free to follow up guests of
  either gender. Since the interaction is relatively brief, we usually need not
  worry about improper conflict of interests like we would with an ongoing discipling
  relationship or even with ongoing follow up.</p>

  opportunity for any in the group to be used by God. However, an effective home
  church will learn to read the situation, making people feel welcome, but not
  overwhelmed. Deference will be shown to those:</p>

margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:1.0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Note
  the difference in approach to a guest before the meeting, vs. after a meeting.
  Most people find that conversations following the meeting are far more appropriate
  for bringing up spiritual matters. Those before the meeting are usually best
  left to general social interaction.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:1.0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Quality
  follow up conversations usually happen while sitting down. We can have good
  conversations while standing around after a meeting, however, they will tend
  to be short and superficial compared to those possible while sitting around
  a table with food and/or drink, or while sitting next to each other on a deck,
  porch, etc. When guests agree to sit down with members, they have made an implied
  commitment to engage in some conversation, rather than take off right after
  the meeting. Home churches should provide for sit-down conversations by having
  tables and chairs or couches available in a suitable setting. Then we can frankly
  ask guests to sit with us for a few minutes. Home churches that go out after
  meetings to a restaurant accomplish the same thing, but run the risk of losing
  some people in transition. Also, going to venues like nightclubs, that are
  too noisy for conversation, are clearly poor for follow up. In general student
  groups do better going out, while adult groups do better staying in.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:1.0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Notice
  that even when sitting in a room surging with many people moving around, conversations
  are difficult. People look around at what is happening in the room and are
  distracted. Also, it doesn’t seem natural to bare your soul to someone in the
  middle of a crowd. This is another reason for seeking out a venue with tables
  and chairs. Sitting around a table seems to wall off the rest of the crowd,
  creating a conversational setting that seems more private.</p>

  eagerness to have more than one spiritual conversation.</p>

  conversations contain more risks than general social conversations, but also

  has to have a spiritual conversation the first time they come to home church,

<h3>Spiritual Conversations: How to go about it</h3>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:1.0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Generally, <b>to
    begin a spiritual conversation</b> you will probe into the area of spirituality,
    watching closely for response. One of the easiest ways is to ask “Have you
    ever been to a meeting like this?” If so, find out what the context was.
    The best thing about this question is that it usually leads to disclosure
    of spiritual background and church involvement, or lack thereof. (Another
    way is to simply ask whether they have ever been involved in a church). This
    is valuable information that might govern how you proceed. If the person
    went to a church when young, find out what kind. Liberal churches are very
    different from fundamentalist churches or Catholic churches. Also, be sure
    to try to find out what their attitude was toward the church. Do they still
    attend? If they don’t, there must have been something negative. These negatives
    toward the church are important because they are usually predictive of the
    preconceptions a person has of Christianity. In American outreach, we usually
    find that the majority of people visiting are negative at some level toward
    their previous church experiences. However, be aware of important exceptions
    where people are very positive about their previous church involvement.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Once
  you gain an understanding of their spiritual past, it should be easy to <b>compare
  and contrast their past with their spiritual present</b>. This could take two
  directions: 1) ask how their views of God have changed up to the present day,
  and whether they would still consider themselves a Christian believer, or a
  believer in God. or 2) ask them to compare what they saw tonight with their
  earlier church experiences. (I actually prefer #2) These should lead to further
  disclosure of their attitudes toward spiritual things, which can be discussed
  and questioned. Here it often becomes natural to begin sharing your own opinion, <b>and
  your own testimony</b>. Another very effective question is, “Where do you see
  yourself today with relation to God or Christianity?”</p>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;

  dealing with those who think they are Christians, but may in fact be nominal
  Christians, the issue of <b>receiving Christ</b> becomes important. It may
  be appropriate to ask if they have ever heard of the idea of receiving Christ
  before, and if they feel they have done that at any particular time. But for
  first conversations, we would not necessarily call on them to do so now unless
  we sense they are very responsive. In many cases, the best call might be that
  they should be considering this possibility, or, put differently, that they
  consider beginning a personal relationship with Christ.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Depending
  on how much exposure the person has had to true biblical Christianity, we may
  want to do no more than share our own testimony, or a few important points
  about grace, and leave it at that. God may lead us to make no call of any kind
  during early conversations, but simply to share.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><b>Ending
    a spiritual conversation</b>: Sometimes, spiritual conversations begin well,
    but end up poorly because we don’t know when to end them. If we get too enthusiastic
    and go on and on, there is danger of overwhelming. If we press for too much
    there is danger of scaring the person off. Usually, there is a natural place
    in the conversation where we have accomplished enough for one week, and need
    to end the discussion on an up-note. We may sense that the person reaches
    a point of satisfaction where he isn’t continuing to ask questions, or has
    a slightly muted response. When this happens, simply suggest the person keep
    an open mind, come back and continue exploring, or simply that you enjoyed
    talking with them about spiritual matters. Then change the subject. Your
    actions here depend on the responsiveness of the person. For a highly responsive
    person, a spiritual conversation could go on for a couple of hours. But most
    spiritual conversations are only 5 to 15 minutes long.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Anyone
  who has a positive spiritual conversation with a new person is usually in good
  position to follow up on that conversation during subsequent meetings. It’s
  natural to ask whether the person feels she has made any progress, or done
  any further thinking about the matters you discussed earlier.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Follow Up</h2>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:left;
text-indent:.15in;line-height:normal'>During the process of ongoing follow up,
  we try to facilitate the new person’s movement through the decision continuum
  to genuine conversion, and finally to full commitment to Christ and his Body.
  In addition to spiritual conversations, it’s natural to have fun socially,
  to get to know the new person, and to foster ongoing involvement by getting
  their number or email address so you can invite them to join in other activities.
  (In student groups, getting the person’s number or email is often a good idea
  even at their first visit to a meeting).</p>
<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Assignment</h3>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:.15in;line-height:normal'>Unlike initial follow up, ongoing follow
  up should be led by an agreed point-person. Home church leaders and workers
  should agree on who is best situated to take the lead, based on standard principles
  of ministry responsibility. The point in agreeing to a point person is not
  to block others from interacting with the new person, but to avoid multiple,
  conflicting invitations and suggestions that could be threatening to guests.
  It also puts the minds of home church members at rest, knowing that someone
  competent is going to be responsible for follow up. Finally, the old adage,
  “Everybody’s job is nobody’s job,” describes the home church where nobody has
  accepted primary responsibility for follow up.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:.15in;line-height:normal'>The bringer is again the first natural
  choice for point person. But others in the same ministry sphere could be assigned.
  Having the lead in ongoing follow up doesn’t mean others shouldn’t help, but
  implies that the group expects the new person to eventually end up being discipled
  by the lead person if all goes well. See <a
href="hcmang.html">Leading Home Church
  Growth</a> for helpful principles in making this decision.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:.15in;line-height:normal'>Other workers should respect the direction
  of the point-person, including reporting all meaningful interactions to that
  person. Anyone who accepts the responsibility for leading ongoing follow up
  is also accountable to the home church for their progress. Note that asking
  to be trusted as point person but then failing to do anything with the new
  person is a serious breach of the community’s trust. Members who let the home
  church down in this way forfeit the confidence of the group in the future.
  On the other hand, those who try and fail should not lose the confidence of
  the group, because this can happen to anybody.</p>
<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Social involvement</h3>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:.15in;line-height:normal'>Your home church should have social events,
  and you may want to suggest other social interactions with the new person.
  Couples normally should work together when reaching out to other couples. Discovering
  shared interests and activities, or just having people over for dinner, going
  to a movie, sporting event, etc. tend to enhance opportunities for sharing,
  while building a sense of common experience. Again, members should be aware
  of each others’ actions, so guests are not overwhelmed with invitations. The
  point person or couple should normally lead in this area.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:.15in;line-height:normal'>We can generally assume that anytime weeks
  have passed since the new person first came to home church or central teaching,
  yet no social involvement has occurred with anyone in the group, we are doing
  a poor job at follow up.</p>
<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Not relaxing tension</h3>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:.15in;line-height:normal'>One of the most common failings in ongoing
  follow up is <b>assuming that we can socialize people into the Body of Christ</b>.
  Social interaction is good for promoting better communication, but it is essential
  that members know how to continue to put the questions of conversion and commitment.
  We must exercise discernment regarding whether the person is moving spiritually,
  or simply hanging around for social reasons. If the latter is true, we will
  lose the person sooner or later. In any event, God’s purposes are not being
  accomplished.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:.15in;line-height:normal'>In our experience, the most common reason
  people fail to press the point spiritually is fear that they will scare the
  new person off by doing so. We need to see that the person will definitely
  be lost if we fail to press the point, so it’s better to lose them because
  they refuse to continue moving spiritually, than simply because they lose interest.
  Of course being pushy can scare people off unnecessarily, but in Xenos we believe
  timidity is a much more common reason for poor follow up. Remember: People’s
  answer to the gospel challenge is not always “yes.” We have to be ready to
  hear a “no” answer, including refusal to come back to fellowship, and still
  feel that the follow up was basically successful. Notice that only one in four
  of the soils in Jesus’ parable were fully responsive. (Mat. 13:1-23) Likewise,
  Paul teaches that the cross is offensive to many, and no amount of social schmoozing
  will change that fact. (1Cor. 1:18-25)</p>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:.15in;line-height:normal'>Consider these points when thinking about
  people who reject Christ and/or further involvement:</p>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:1.0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
  person has not necessarily been lost. Many who make a decision to reject involvement
  with Christ later change their minds.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
  fact, we believe people are more likely to reconsider rejecting involvement
  with Christ if they consciously decided to do so, than if they simply wandered
  off because of distractions or boredom. A person who knowingly turns her back
  on Christ is in better shape than one who simply forgot what the point was.
  This is because, when the issues are clear in a person’s mind God will more
  easily convict her conscience than if she is unsure what actually happened
  back when she tried “going to church.”</p>

  the questions of conversion and commitment in the foreground is easy, because

  seriously considering spiritual matters.</p>
<h3>Drawing the net</h3>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:.15in;line-height:normal'>As we maintain tension during ongoing follow
  up, we will likely reach a point where we need to draw the net—that is we may
  need to call for a decision. This isn’t always necessary, because some people
  spontaneously make the decision without prompting. But in cases where this
  is not happening after a reasonable time, good follow up includes directly
  challenging people to make a decision one way or the other.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:.15in;line-height:normal'>The logic for this is partly related to
  the fact that no decision is a decision in itself. Jesus said, “He who is not
  with Me is against Me.” (Luke 11:23) When movement on the decision continuum
  ceases or slows, we know the person has to make a decision, or we will lose
  them anyway. With others who are moving well, the logic of their current thinking
  points to the need for immediate decision. Failure to make a decision at that
  point can derail the good progress made so far.</p>

  and spiritual process, and other people are definitely in a position to influence
  the outcome. Satan is active, planting fears and distractions. The Holy Spirit

  be active as well, putting clearly the point, and personally urging people

    they are unwilling to receive him. But we need to point out that they are,
    indeed, doing just that. People need to be frankly warned that the longer
    they delay and refuse, the harder it will be to finally decide. There is
    a hardening of the heart when someone knows the truth and won’t surrender
    to it. For longer term resistant people we need to be very direct and solemn
    in pointing these truths out, also reminding people that we are worried about
    them.]</i></p>
<h3>Leading someone to Christ</h3>

text-indent:.15in;line-height:normal'>If someone wants to make the decision to
  surrender to Christ, should you offer to pray with them on the spot, or suggest
  they do so on their own? We suggest you decide ahead of time which direction
  to go. Some evangelists feel drawn to one approach or another in general. Also,
  the timidity of the person could have a bearing. Would this person agree to
  pray purely in order to please you? If so, it may be best to tell them to do
  it when they go home. Good cases can be made for either approach, depending
  on the situation, but witnessers who decide what to do at the moment a person
  expresses willingness often find themselves later wishing they had done the
  other thing. Pray about this beforehand.</p>
<h3>Further involvement</h3>

text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>With apparent Christians, invitations to
  cell group or to personal times of study become appropriate. The whole question
  must be raised, whether the new believe is interested in spiritual growth.
  Numerous issues rise at this point:</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
  may be barriers (such as someone living with a lover) that must be broached
  and the truth pointed out; that such situations are going to have to be addressed
  before spiritual growth can proceed. </p>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Married
  people must consider what position their spouses are going to adopt. In general,
  every effort should be made to reach both partners in a marriage before suggesting
  heavy involvement for either one.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Time
  commitments must be considered. Often we do better to wait before suggesting
  classes or even cell group for some new people. One important reason for this
  may be that they are part of a larger affinity group that we should try to
  reach immediately. If they see their friend or family member too busy with
  fellowship activities to spend as much time with them, the prospect of reaching
  them diminishes.</p>
<h3>Movement toward commitment</h3>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:21.8pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:.15in;line-height:normal'>As a home church pursues ongoing follow
  up, we will normally see movement, either toward or away from Christian commitment. </p>

margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:21.8pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:.15in;line-height:normal'>When they move toward commitment, be sure
  new people understand their options for living out that commitment. Our first
  concern is that the person truly meet Christ. Other cases may be more ambivalent—the
  person believes he is a Christian even though the reasons seem questionable
  (e.g. childhood conversion, general belief in God, etc.) People who are unable
  to articulate the point of the cross need to understand the gospel more clearly,
  and should be urged to “make sure” they have surrendered to Christ. Primary
  concerns during follow up include the so-called “means of growth.”</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Prayer
  – Make sure the new person understands how to pray, the importance of prayer,
  and as soon as plausible, has the experience of praying with others. Corporate
  prayer is often a key turning point where people go from viewing their relationship
  with God as a strictly private matter, to something shared with the Body of
  Christ.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Scripture
  – Make sure new people understand the importance of the Bible as spiritual
  food. Offer to help them understand it through private meetings. Help them
  get a decent Bible of their own. (Buying a Bible for a new person may be wise,
  but having them invest some of their own money is often even better).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Body
  Life – New Christians and Christians from institutional churches generally
  do not understand the significance of Body Life. American Christians tend to
  view Christianity in individualistic terms, and need time to learn that our
  faith should be lived out together.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ministry
  – Even very new Christians can become quite excited about sharing their faith
  with their friends and relatives. Ask what their friends think about their
  new involvement with God. Try to discover whether they are already spontaneously
  sharing their faith, and whether they are encountering problems. In good follow
  up, we try to win entire affinity groups. This means we should take an interest
  in meeting a new person’s friends, family, and especially spouses or lovers.
  This should lead to further promising opportunities to witness. Explaining
  how serving others in small ways in the Body (including sharing or praying
  at meetings) is edifying and fun.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Suffering
  – Warn new Christians that suffering is part of the Christian life, and make
  them aware of basic ways to respond, based on biblical passages. Also begin
  early to make them aware of the reality of Satan and his likely schemes to
  accuse and deceive them. Watch for signs of dissonance (second thoughts about
  their decision to follow Christ) and help them work through these as a natural
  part of coming to Christ (i.e. without panic).</p>

text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>Discerning what is needed at any given time
  with new people is not always easy. We suggest you share regularly with your
  colleagues in home church seeking consensus on what to call for and when. Well-unified
  work forces have a developing shared consensus on what the near-term goals
  are for all key people in ongoing follow up.</p>

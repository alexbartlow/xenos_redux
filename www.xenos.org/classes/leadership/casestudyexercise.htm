<p><font size="4">We will divide into work groups and assign one case study to each group. You have 25 minutes to reach a conclusion. Record your rationale for the decision or plan you're recommending, and appoint one of your members to give a 3-5 minute  report to the class. </font></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Case study 1:</strong> This boy was won in Xenos high chool group and  walked for a few years. He left the Lord, then came back and is now your  disciple in college. He seems to be growing,  but doesn&rsquo;t witness, even though he has an out-going personality and is well-liked.  You sense he is afraid to try witnessing, and he confirms that he is afraid of  what people think about him. He gets defensive when you bring it up. For a  number of months now, you have made no progress. He still doesn&rsquo;t witness.</font> </p>
<p><font size="4">  - Devise a plan for creating motivation and getting him to witness. Include a  follow up plan if he does witness, imagining several scenarios.</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Case study 2:</strong> This guy is a long-standing believer in your home  church, but often a negative force. He is cynical and rebellious, often  shooting holes in directions suggested by leaders. He also talks smack about  some leaders. He doesn&rsquo;t invest in others, seems selfish, and is never around  at the ministry house. You worry that he may be negatively influencing younger  brothers, because a couple have shown up saying similar things. On the other  hand, he hangs out with non Christians, and occasionally shows up with one or  two. A couple have received Christ. He even meets with a guy he reached,  although you naturally wonder whether any true discipleship is going on. His  discipler (a fellow leader) seems soft, because this pattern has been going on  for a year and a half, and they still meet every week, but no change. You&rsquo;ve  suggested the fellow leader take a strong stand with him, even threatening to  end discipleship and take other measures, but he is reluctant.  - After discussing and analyzing the variables in this case, devise a plan to  motivate this trouble-making brother and his soft discipler.<strong>Case study 3:</strong> You are co-leader in a girls&rsquo; cell group (9 girls) that  is struggling. They don&rsquo;t witness much, often squabble, lack unity, and some of  them drink and party too much. They could all live in the ministry house, but  several prefer not to move in for vague reasons. Sometimes a number of them  don&rsquo;t come to cell and give lame excuses. After cell, the girls often have  things to do, and don&rsquo;t hang out together. Several girls seem like they could  be good, but you don&rsquo;t sense that most of them are really putting out to  progress in ministry. One or two seem to be progressing better than the others,  but they don&rsquo;t seem to have much ability to influence the others. Recently, a  leader from another home church asked if your girls aspire to become leaders in  their own right. After reflecting a moment you said &ldquo;No, maybe in a loose  sense, like &lsquo;I might do that someday&rsquo; but not in any strong sense.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p><font size="4"> - Analyze this group of girls and determine what is probably wrong with them. Form  a plan to respond victoriously.</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Case study 3:</strong></font> <font size="4">You are consulting a home church that had good  success at one time, but has been unsuccessful for the past year. Not  surprisingly, it turns out that the leaders in this group have a fairly dim  view of each other&rsquo;s competence in ministry. Through discussions with  individual leaders you see that each can easily itemize real failures in the  others, but find it hard to describe significant successes. Leaders&rsquo; meetings  are weak in communication, and they apparently have suspicions about each other,  in terms of the motivations for comments made. They feel reluctant to share  openly, because they feel they will be criticized or misunderstood. Leaders commonly  tell other leaders, &ldquo;you need to do a better job with so and so on this or  that,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s hard to take, because the same ones giving the admonition have  problems just as serious or even worse in their own ministries that they don&rsquo;t  seem to be doing much about. Low-key pessimism seems to be slipping in.</font><br>
    <br>
    <font size="4">Analyze this group. What is the heart of the issue(s) leading to this behavior?  What are some possible insights, steps, etc. that you are going to recommend to  this group?</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Case study 4:</strong> Lori has been coming to your group for the past three  months on and off. She was brought out by Jeanne, another new person, but  Jeanne has disappeared, and you hear she is moving to New York for a job  opportunity. Lately, Lori has become more regular, and more excited, and women  in the church now have determined that she has received Christ.  In your leaders&rsquo; meeting, you are going to discuss who should be put on Lori as  the point person for ongoing follow up and discipleship. Since she is a neutral  person, several people are plausible for this role. Leaders&rsquo; meeting is  tomorrow, and you need to consider who you will favor to get this assignment.</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font size="4"><strong>Kate</strong> is a  leader who has done good discipleship, but two of her disciples were sent off  in the last church plant as leaders. She is trying to disciple a fairly low  potential gal now, but she has pointed out before that she can&rsquo;t get this gal  to move, and is skeptical about her chances.</font></li>
  <li><font size="4"><strong>Becky</strong> is a  sit-in leader who needs a disciple because she just lost a woman and her other  woman isn&rsquo;t doing too well and could be lost at any time.</font></li>
  <li><font size="4"><strong>Suzanne</strong> is a  younger member who has done good work in the initial follow up with Lori. She had  coffee several times with Lori outside the meeting. They seem to hit it off.  Suzanne has no disciples, so this would be her first.</font></li>
  <li><font size="4"><strong>Elaine</strong> brought the new person who in turn brought Lori. She has another disciple, but  she probably is assuming that Lori should be her disciple, because she was the  bringer.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All four women would be happy to get  this assignment, and all four have had positive interaction with Lori during  the past few weeks. Also, you have detected that your leaders are going to have  different opinions about who to choose. For each woman, list factors that would  be positive or negative in terms of assigning that person to try to enlist Lori  as her disciple. To make this decision, you also need to weight the factors&mdash;is  this factor highly important, or not so important?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5" >As of 2002</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" >The New Testament clearly teaches that the church is to be 
  a community of support, nurture, service, and also <i>discipline</i>. Admonishing 
  one another is an important component of Christian love as depicted in the Bible, 
  contrary to the view of our postmodern culture. We would agree with our culture 
  that admonition based on nothing more than personal opinion would be presumptuous 
  and arrogant. However, with the Word of God, we have a basis for correcting 
  each other, and such correction, when practiced in a spirit of grace and acceptance, 
  will have life-transforming power.</font> <font size="+1">Thus, Paul says, &quot;And 
  concerning you, my brethren, I myself also am convinced that you yourselves 
  are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able also to admonish one 
  another.&quot;</font> (<font size="+1">Rom. </font><font size=+1>15:14)</font>
</p><p><font size="+1" >Scripture mentions various types of discipline, but each type 
  is appropriate in in different circumstances. Consider carefully what God would 
  want in any situation.</font>
</p><h1><font  size="+1">Types of Discipline:</font> </h1>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Reproof, rebuke, admonishment:</b></font>
</p><blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">Any errant brother or sister may be reproved by the concerned 
    brother or sister who discovers the error. Leaders should instruct members 
    in <a href="../principles/cpu3_encourage.htm">appropriate admonition</a>, 
    stressing the redemptive nature of discipline over against legalistic views. 
    In general, leaders should encourage members to reprove those whom they find 
    in sin themselves, rather than &quot;tattling&quot; in order to get leaders 
    to do all the discipline in the church. This leaves members immature and disengaged 
    from others' problems, and contributes to the clergy-laity mentality.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">While leaders should urge members to discipline their friends 
    in most cases, we may see exceptions where the issues are too serious to be 
    handled by young Christians. In normal cases we should give basic instruction 
    regarding the elements of successful discipline:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font size="+1">That initial confrontation should be done privately if 
      possible ("And if your brother sins, go and reprove him in private; if he 
      listens to you, you have won your brother.&quot; Mat. 18:15)</font></li>
    <li><font size="+1">That the one admonishing should prepare before God, discovering </font>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="+1">scripture relevant to the need</font></li>
        <li><font size="+1">ways to persuade</font></li>
        <li><font size="+1">steps the one in sin can take to find healing</font></li>
        <li><font size="+1">positive vision and encouragement for the one being 
          admonished</font></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><font size="+1">That if the person is unresponsive to discipline, others, 
      including leaders may need to become involved. Members should seek counsel 
      on how to proceed at this point.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font size="+1" >Leaders and others involved may decide at this point that 
    the issue is not serious enough to pursue further--that the one in sin has 
    heard our message, and God will take the issue up in the future. However, 
    in other cases, we may determine that the issue is too serious to let drop. 
    In such cases, the member who originally admonished the person should return, 
    along with one or more brothers or sisters (not necessarily home church leaders, 
    but an older believer who is respected in the home church) and together they 
    should try again to persuade the person to repent. ("But if he does not listen 
    to you, take one or two more with you, so that 'By the mouth of two or three 
    witnesses every fact may be confirmed.&quot; Mat. 18:16) This could be repeated 
    several times if, in the judgment of the leaders, further admonition is more 
    likely to produce repentance. However, in cases where the leadership no longer 
    believe further admonition will have effect, or where the sin is serious enough 
    to threaten the well-being of the church, it may become necessary to issue 
    an ultimatum before the church. At this point, it becomes a matter of formal 
    church discipline. ("And if he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; 
    and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile 
    and a tax-gatherer.&quot; Mat. 18:17).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font  size="+1"><b>Formal church discipline</b> </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1" >Formal church discipline is an unusual and extreme response 
    to sin in the church. In some cases, our efforts to do what is best for the 
    one in error, as well as our obligation to guard the atmosphere and holiness 
    of the church requires that we issue an ultimatum of some kind.</font> <font size="+1">(See 
    the full biblical case for church discipline in the paper, <a href="discip.html">&quot;The 
    New Testament Pattern of Church Discipline&quot;</a>)</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1" >As a true replicating house church movement, Xenos entrusts 
    the exercise of church discipline to you, the home church leaders, but under 
    the general oversight and counsel of the elders. Since this area is sensitive 
    and potentially dangerous, be sure you follow fellowship policy, which is 
    for your protection. When disciplining members, try to follow Biblical principles 
    of discipline in a way that best fits both the spirit of New Testament teaching, 
    and the particular situation in your church. You will need a lot of prayer 
    and counsel to seek out God's will in the highly individualized situations 
    in your church. Because we are responding to varying situations, these procedures 
    can and do change. To date we agree that the following procedures should be 
    considered normative. </font> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font  size="+1"><b>Removal from Fellowship</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">Removing someone from fellowship is a grave and serious matter, 
    and should only be undertaken when all else fails. We can expect a backlash 
    from our culture and from the immature within our own church any time we remove 
    someone from fellowship, and you should consider this when weighing what to 
    do. Since church discipline is a matter of serving love, not legalism, we 
    decide how to proceed based on what it best for all, not based on any legal 
    principle. However, when appropriate, we should take the stand God wants, 
    not fearing other's reactions.</font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">We should only threaten to remove someone from fellowship 
    if the person's case meets the following criteria:</font> </p>
  <ol>
    <li>      <font size="+1">The person's sin problem has to be <b>serious</b>, along 
    the lines described on biblical passages on this subject as outlined below</font>    </li>
    <li>      <font size="+1">The person should be ensnared in sin as a part of a <b>lifestyle</b> of disregard for God's will, rather than an existential <b>fall from grace</b>. In a fall from grace, the person is striving to 
        change, but meeting with occasional failure. Even people who are trying 
        to change may eventually benefit from church discipline, because it can 
        give them strength to resist temptation by underscoring the seriousness 
    of sin.</font>    </li>
    <li>      <font size="+1">The person should have been admonished at least twice, 
        including at least one reproof by more than one person (in accordance 
    with Mat. 18).</font>    </li>
    <li>      <font size="+1"> The one in sin is not repentant. An absence of repentance 
        means that the person continues to think that the sin is &quot;all right&quot; 
      or &quot;not my fault,&quot; or continues to lie. If the person claims 
        to be repentant, we should give him/her the benefit of the doubt in most 
        cases. The person might commit the sin again later, even though repentant. 
    In other words, recurrence is not in, every case, proof of lack of repentance.</font>    </li>
    <li>      <font size="+1"> In normal admonition, we usually allow the person time 
        to make a sober decision about whether to repent, rather than trying to 
        force a decision on the spot. This allows the Holy Spirit time to work 
        on the person. However, in extreme cases where the person has been brought 
        before the church, the time for thinking about it is over, and a decision 
    is due on the spot.</font>    </li>
    <li>      <font size="+1">The leaders of the home church agree, and have consulted 
    with the elders, who also agree that the case warrants a formal ultimatum.</font>    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" ><b>What kinds of sin are serious enough to merit removal from 
  fellowship?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">Although we have no proof that the lists of sins calling 
    for removal from fellowship (I&nbsp;Cor. 5:11; II&nbsp;Thess. 3:6-15; I Tim. 
    1:20; Titus 3:10) are exhaustive, we think we should generally reserve this 
    kind of discipline for the kinds of serious sin mentioned in these passages. </font> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1"> Sins listed scripturally as serious enough to remove someone 
      include:</font> </p>
    <ol>
      <li><font size="+1"><b>Sexual immorality</b> I&nbsp;Cor. 5:11 </font></li>
      <li><font size="+1"><b>Covetous</b> I Cor.5:11 - apparently excessive 
        materialism and/or advocating and promoting materialism</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1"><b>Idolatry</b> I Cor. 5:11 - Since idolatry was 
        the major rival religious system of the day, it corresponds to adherence 
        to contemporary false religious systems. Thus, persistent practicing 
        of occult, mystical, or pantheistic systems could eventually result 
        in removal.</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1"><b>Reviling</b> I Cor. 5:11 - slander. This may 
        be the same as the schismatic (see below). Clear evidence of a trouble-making 
        life style should evident.</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1"><b>Drunkard</b> I Cor. 5:11 - includes habitual 
        use of other intoxicating drugs</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1"><b>Swindling</b> I Cor. 5:11 - business cheaters 
        - borrowing without repayment, or other kinds of stealing or cheating, 
        including, in some cases, breaking marriage commitment for no good 
        reason.</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1"><b>Unruly life</b> II Thes.3:6 - refusal to work 
        or go to school, even though the ability and the opportunity to work 
        are clearly present.</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1"><b>Division of the local church</b> Titus 3:10,11 
        - collecting followers in opposition to the established leadership. 
        Note the <a href="leadershipandauth.html#dissent">difference between 
        division and dissent</a>.</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1"><b>False teaching</b> I Tim. 1:20 - The examples 
        we have of this involve a central area of doctrine. There is no Biblical 
        justification for applying this kind of discipline in a nonessential 
        area.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p><font size="+1">In addition, we believe that other sins not specifically 
      mentioned may call for removal as well. Examples include:</font> </p>
    <ol>
      <li><font size="+1">Various types of social violence such as rape, 
        assault, domestic violence, child abuse, and premeditated murder (which 
        could include, in some cases, abortion if not done out of ignorance).</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Drug abuse, which is implied in the term &quot;drunkard&quot;(I 
        Cor. 5:11).</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Certain kinds of unrighteous divorce.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p><font size="+1"> Things that do <big><u>not</u></big> justify removal 
      from fellowship include:</font> </p>
    <ol>
      <li><font size="+1"> Ungodly marriages with non-Christians or with 
        uncommitted or sinful Christians</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1"> Ungodly dating</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1"> Disobedience to church authority</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1"> Disagreement with, or criticism of, church authority</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1"> Any sin committed before conversion, even if still 
        having effect</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1"> Any sin (even though serious) for which the person 
        has repented.</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1"> Sins of omission</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1"> Other sins also [we put this here to make clear 
        that our list isn't exhaustive]</font></li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"><b>&quot;Telling it to the church&quot; (Mat. 18:17)</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If the case meets the criteria mentioned above, the home church 
  leaders should call their overseer and explain the case. After counseling together, 
  the <b>elders</b> will be asked for approval before anything else is done. If 
  they approve, the home church leaders should gather a good sampling of their 
  home church members to discuss the matter with the person in sin. If, in the 
  judgment of the group assembled, the person is not repentant, they are empowered 
  to remove the errant member from further attendance at any fellowship meetings.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Procedure</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The errant member should be told that a meeting is being called 
  in accordance with Jesus' instructions, and that he or she will be expected 
  to attend. Tell the person when the meeting is, picking a time when you know 
  they will be able to attend. Point out that attendance is not optional and that 
  the meeting will go forward with, or without them. Explain that refusal to attend 
  will be viewed as &quot;refusing to hear&quot; the church as mentioned by Christ 
  in Mat. 18, and will result in their removal from fellowship. If the person 
  has a schedule problem, but really wants to come, you should be willing to change 
  the meeting time.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1"><b> Key points to remember when leading a disciplinary 
    meeting:</b></font></p>
  <ol>
    <li>      <font size="+1">Be sure to talk to your members before the meeting 
        to explain what is happening and why. Younger Christians may need to 
        have the <a href="discip.html">biblical material</a> explained to them. 
        Avoid having anyone at the meeting who doesn't understand what church 
    discipline is, or why it is happening.</font>    </li>
    <li>      <font size="+1">Together with members of the church, pray in advance 
        that the meeting will be successful in restoring the errant brother 
    or sister.</font>    </li>
    <li>      <font size="+1">Point out to members that they don't need to go 
        soft with the errant one, or to express sympathy in a way that excuses 
        their way of life. The point of the meeting is to point out the seriousness 
        of the sinful way of life, not to minimize it. Encourage members to 
        confess their own sins to God beforehand, but to show up ready to do 
        the right thing in standing for righteous living, or at least for trying 
        to follow God. The one being disciplined needs our strength, not our 
    weakness in this situation.</font>    </li>
    <li>      <font size="+1">Encourage selected members who have been affected 
        by the sin, either directly or indirectly, to speak up at the meeting, 
        urging the one in sin to see the seriousness of such an evil way of 
        life. At a good disciplinary meeting, the leaders are not the only ones 
        to speak in admonition. This is an opportunity for the whole community, 
        like a family, to plead with the errant person for change. But the leaders 
        normally have to encourage this in advance because young believers may 
    be too upset or worried to speak otherwise.</font>    </li>
    <li>      <font size="+1">Ask members if they are in agreement when talking 
        to them before the meeting. If some members don't agree with the move 
        to discipline, this should be resolved before the meeting. Disunity 
        at the meeting on the issue of whether the church should be taking disciplinary 
        action could shift attention away from the real issue, and therefore 
    should be avoided if at all possible.</font>    </li>
    <li>      <font size="+1">If, after talking to members, the church remains 
        disunited (in that some members feel the one being disciplined is being 
        treated unfairly or unlovingly) be prepared to argue this point on the 
        spot. Do not forbid anyone to share their opinion, but simply take your 
        stand on what the Bible says, and demand that members show why they 
        don't think the passages should be followed. Interpretation is involved 
        in such a decision, so it is possible for well-intentioned believers 
        to disagree over what should be done. Since the elders have agreed that 
        formal discipline is warranted, this should be mentioned as a factor 
        to consider. If the church is still not unanimous after debating the 
        issue, you should take a vote at the meeting on which course of action 
        should be taken, explaining that the majority will rule, and those in 
        the minority are obligated to accept the decision. According to 2 Cor. 
        2:6, the majority at such a meeting should decide what action to take. 
    Be sure to report any disagreement to your supervisor.</font>    </li>
    <li>      <font size="+1">If you know in advance that some members are not 
        in agreement with taking disciplinary action, be sure to inform your 
        supervisor so that an elder or other representative of the leadership 
        has the opportunity to attend the meeting as well, to explain their 
    position.</font>    </li>
    <li>      <font size="+1">Have your senior leader chair the meeting, explaining 
        publicly that you have come together along the lines prescribed in Scripture 
        to address a member who is in sin, and that you have called on the person 
        to hear the admonition of the church. You may need to read relevant 
        passages, reminding people of the basis for church discipline. The tone 
        should be sober, firm, but not self-righteous or harsh. The overriding 
        point should be concern for the well-being of the one being disciplined 
        and of the church. Then have people in the church tell why they are 
        disappointed, grieved, worried, and angry about how the person has been 
        living, speaking directly to the person in the presence of all. Include 
        the positive with the negative--why the person is important and has 
        great potential, and how this is being ruined by their way of life. 
        If the person wants to answer, let them, but feel free to argue. Disciplinary 
        meetings are not neat, tidy affairs, but try to keep the tone civil 
    and respectful.</font>    </li>
    <li>      <font size="+1">If the group decides to remove the person from fellowship, 
        you should ask them to leave then and there, immediately. Make it clear 
        that the errant one must contact one of the home church leaders before 
        returning to any meeting, including Central Teachings. Then, after the 
        person has left, discuss the situation with the church, reassuring them 
        that by doing the right thing, they have honored God and his word, and 
        have given the one disciplined the best chance for repentance. In all 
        likelihood, they have raised the church up to a new level spiritually. 
        Pray together for the one disciplined and for yourselves, &quot;lest 
    you, too, be tempted&quot; (Gal. 6:1)</font>    </li>
    <li>      <font size="+1">Even if the person is not removed at the meeting, 
        the church may issue a warning that continuing in sin will result in 
        removal. It is up to the discernment of the Home Church leaders and 
        elders to determine what subsequent sin would constitute a willful sin 
        pattern, rather than a fall from grace. Chronic wrongdoers should be 
        warned at the disciplinary meeting that simply saying they agree with 
        the church and continuing to sneak their serious sin is not good enough. 
        If someone lies to the church at a disciplinary meeting, and continues 
        in sin, home church leaders can remove such a one even without holding 
    another meeting, but subject to elders' approval.</font>    </li>
    <li>      <font size="+1">If the person disagrees with the ethical position 
        the church is taking, or thinks that the church has no right to speak 
        to the issue, or demands the freedom to continue with the immoral behavior, 
        we would consider them as &quot;not listening to the church,&quot; and 
        they would be removed from fellowship. The person could also make other 
        equivocating statements that suggest lack of repentance. The church 
    must assess the person's attitude when determining repentance.</font>    </li>
    <li>      <font size="+1">Finally, the elders and home church leaders also 
        have to agree that the offender is <b>capable</b> of terminating the 
        sin with the provision presently available (i.e., an alcoholic or drug 
        addict has been offered help and support). In cases where the errant 
        one needs help, he should be called upon to avail himself this help. 
    Refusal to do this could result in removal from fellowship,</font>    </li>
    <li>      <font size="+1">In case the church judges a person to be unrepentant, 
        but the person still wants to return to fellowship as soon as possible, 
        have a plan of restoration ready. This plan will clarify whether the 
        person is serious, or only wants to return to fellowship as a &quot;love-taker.&quot; 
      At the same time, it should provide the errant believer with important 
    counsel and help in overcoming sin.</font>    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><font size="+1"> In some cases, people might be removed from fellowship even 
    though they never met with the church. Cases where this could happen include: </font> </p>
  <ol>
    <li>      <font size="+1">The person refuses to come to the meeting of the 
        church. If this happens, have the meeting as scheduled anyway, and discuss 
        with the members why you are removing the person. Refusal to come to 
        the meeting of the church is considered &quot;refusing to listen to 
    the church&quot; (Mat. 18:17) and is grounds for removal.</font>    </li>
    <li>      <font size="+1">The person doesn't belong to a home church because 
        they never joined one. In some cases, the elders or other staff leaders 
        may remove a person like this who is not affiliated with a home church. 
    Such cases are handled on a case-by-case basis.</font>    </li>
    <li>      <font size="+1">The person is flagrantly disruptive of meetings, 
        or too physically dangerous to risk allowing him/her to attend even 
        one more meeting. This last case is very unusual, but could occur with 
        mentally unbalanced people who go berserk in a meeting or other gathering 
        of the church, or who make threats of violence toward members or their 
        children. If the leaders of a home church decide they must summarily 
        exclude a person, they should advise their supervisor as soon as possible 
    afterward.</font>    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><font size="+1"><b>After Removal:</b></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>        <font size="+1">You should let members who didn't come to the meeting 
          know that the church has disciplined the errant member. The method used 
          for disseminating the information should be selected by the leadership 
          of the group, but usually should be handled through cell groups or one-on-one. 
          Also explain to your members how they should handle chance meetings 
          with one under discipline, and that they should not seek out meetings 
          with the person (1 Cor. 5:11; 2 Thess. 3:14-15). Point out that the 
          person has chosen to live apart from God's will, and therefore should 
          not be supported in that decision by Christians extending the benefit 
      of Christian love and fellowship.</font>      </li>
      <li>        <font size="+1"> The elders should be informed of the steps taken 
          and the outcome through your supervisor. The person under discipline 
      will not be allowed to attend other Xenos meetings.</font>      </li>
      <li>        <font size="+1"> If the person leaves fellowship during the process 
          of discipline, but before a meeting of the church is scheduled, we should 
          not pursue the issue further. In this case, no formal church discipline 
          has occurred. Removal from fellowship is only for those who want to 
          remain <i>in</i> fellowship while pursuing a lifestyle of flagrant sin. 
          People in sin leave fellowship all the time after receiving various 
          warnings or reproof, and no special stand need be taken by the church. 
          Such people have removed themselves. If such a person returns, of course, 
          the issues which caused them to leave in the first place should be resolved. 
          Also, by &quot;leaving fellowship,&quot; we mean they leave central 
          meetings and all other meetings as well. We do not allow people to transfer 
          to a different home group, or to attend Central Teachings in order to 
      avoid church discipline.</font>      </li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1"><b> Returning to fellowship after removal</b></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="+1">We have only one passage on this subject (II Cor. 2:5-11) 
        and even that tells us very little about the criteria for reinstatement. 
        Paul says the punishment has been &quot;sufficient&quot; although we do 
        not know exactly how he reached this conclusion. Apparently, a clue is 
        that the offender was in danger of being &quot;overwhelmed by excessive 
        grief.&quot; This seems to mean that he has clearly seen the error of 
        his ways and wanted to return to fellowship in &quot;sorrow&quot; (which 
        suggests humility). An attitude that blames others for the sin, or excuses 
        it in some other way, suggests that repentance has not occurred. These 
        issues should be carefully examined before reinstatement, lest the discipline 
        be insufficient and accomplish nothing. The following are the criteria 
        for returning to fellowship:</font></p>
      <ol>
        <li>          <font size="+1">Home church leaders must agree to reinstate a person 
            under discipline, normally in consultation with their supervisor. No 
            action is required by the elders. Members do not have the authority 
        to act without agreement of the home church leaders.</font>        </li>
        <li>          <font size="+1">Normally, the sin involved has been successfully terminated, 
            or at least the person agrees to try to terminate it with the help of 
        God and the Church, and has agreed to the leaders' plan of restoration.</font>        </li>
        <li>          <font size="+1"> You should also consult your supervisor(s), and if 
        they feel it necessary, they have also interviewed the person.</font>        </li>
        <li>          <font size="+1">If anyone suffered material loss, they may need to 
        be restituted, or a plan of restoration could be agreed.</font>        </li>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">Under certain unusual circumstances, a member of a Home 
      Church may be denied permission to attend Home Church, while still allowed 
      to attend the Central Meeting. This form of discipline is not excommunication, 
      and the offender may still attend other meetings and fellowship with believers. 
      Removal from Home Church amounts to a denial of privilege within the fellowship, 
      whereas removal from fellowship refers to <i>all</i> involvement in the 
      local Church. </font> </p>
    <p><font size="+1">This form of discipline is very unusual, and requires 
      certain criteria: </font> </p>
    <ol>
      <li>        <font size="+1">The person is guilty of sins which are harmful to 
          the Home Church, but which <b><i>do not qualify for removal from fellowship</i></b> (e.g. disrupting the meeting; a brother who harasses sisters, youth 
          group members given a temporary suspension from attendance privileges 
      because of fighting, etc.)</font>      </li>
      <li>        <font size="+1">If the sin involved is serious enough to require 
          removal from fellowship, this kind of discipline would be unbiblical 
          and is not permitted in our church. If we remove someone from the home 
          group, we are saying that we cannot benefit them there. Why then, would 
          we leave them in Central Meetings? The large meeting is not going to 
          be able to do anything that the home group is unable to do. Such people 
          should be disciplined in the normal scriptural way, where the home church 
      takes responsibility for discipline in love.</font>      </li>
      <li>        <font size="+1">You should consult your supervisor beforehand unless 
          the discipline is in a youth group, or the exclusion was an emergency 
          measure, such as a person menacing people in the group, or disrupting 
      meetings. Whether before or after removal, <i>your consultant must agree</i> that this kind of discipline is appropriate. </font>      </li>
      <li>        <font size="+1">No series of meetings is necessary for this discipline. 
          The home group leaders may inform the offender that he is unwelcome 
          for the time being, and be sure to make clear that they may not go to 
          a different home church. In most cases you should have reproved the 
          person before applying this discipline. A plan for restitution should 
      also be discussed at this time or as soon as possible.</font>      </li>
      <li>        <font size="+1">The Home Church leaders should agree on such a major 
      decision.</font>      </li>
      <li>        <font size="+1">In emergency cases, a disrupter or dangerous person 
          can be turned out immediately and told that he/she will have to meet 
          with the leaders before returning. Of course, the leaders should make 
      real provision for such a meeting if the person wants it.</font>      </li>

          he/she left, unless the new home group agrees with full knowledge of 
          past history, to receive him/her back. Your supervisor should also agree 
      if the person is to be received into a different home church.</font>      </li>
      <li>        <font size="+1">The Home Church leaders are satisfied that the problem

  <p><font size="+1">Note: When exclusion from a meeting is used as discipline, 
    the enforcement of this discipline should be <b>left to the police</b>. 
    We <b>do not threaten violence or commit violent acts</b> in order to turn 
    someone out of a meeting. At most, if a person is violent or dangerous, 
    church members may physically restrain the person without violence, either 
    ushering them out, or waiting until the police arrive. Home Church leaders 
    should obtain the agreement of any host (i.e., home owner) where they meet, 
    that a trespassing complaint will be filed against any undesirables who 
    come to a meeting which they are forbidden to attend. In the case of meetings 
    in property leased by Xenos, the right to control those who attend is already

<p><font size="+1"><b> Removal from cell group or other special activities</b></font></p>

    a chance to change the objectionable behavior, or in other ways addressing

  <p><font size="+1">Also, any standard broken should have been delineated beforehand.

      that of members.</font>      </li>
      <li>        <font size="+1">Over-strictness, or bossiness, including misuse

      <li>        <font size="+1">Leaders may also be removed for non-disciplinary

    </ol>
    <p><font size="+1"> Procedure </font>
    </p><ol>
      <li>        <font size="+1"><b>Home group leaders </b>- Home church leaders 
          can only be removed from their position by the elders, not by their 
          fellow leaders. If the other leaders feel one of their team should be 
          removed, they must consult with the elders who will make the decision. 
          Usually, the elders will agree with the leadership of the home church, 
      but don't take this for granted--check with the elders first.</font>      </li>
      <li>        <font size="+1"><b>Cell group leaders, <a href="../../ministries/college/minhouse.htm">ministry 
          house</a> leaders, </b>and <b>other leaders </b>in the home church - 
          These can be removed by agreement of the home church leaders in that 
          home church. There is no need to consult with the Elders. Be sure to 
          demonstrate restraint. Any perception that home church leaders are capricious 
      would harm the motivation in your home church.</font>      </li>
      <li>        <font size="+1"><b>Ministry Team Leaders</b> - Ministry team leaders 
          can be removed by the senior leader of the team in accordance with the 
          rules of the ministry team. Your supervisor should be informed, and 
      in most cases should be consulted in advance.</font>      </li>
      <li>        <font size="+1"><b>Elders</b> - Complaints against an elder should 
          be addressed to another elder or to the grievance board. Unless there 
          are two or three witnesses, or unless the elder admits the truth of 
          the accusation, or unless there is additional evidence of wrongdoing, 
          complaints may not result in discipline, although they will always be 
          investigated (I Tim. 5:19). If an elder is found to be in sin, and the 
          sin is not corrected within a reasonable time, and if it bears on the 
          qualifications for eldership, the elder should be rebuked publicly at 
          the servant team meeting by the other elders and/or leaders. If the 
          problem is not corrected at this point the elder will be removed by 
          a vote of the majority of the other elders. The servant team meeting 
          will be informed of the removal and the reasons for it. Elders can also 
          be voted out of office by the servant team after any of their 3 year 
      terms of office.</font>      </li>
    </ol>

  <p><font size="+1">When home churches have to come together to discipline one 
    of their own, everyone feels the pain. But don't worry about your home church 
    being messed up or losing heart because of church discipline. The opposite 
    is usually the case. Home groups who pay the price of love for disciplining 
    their own members usually find themselves encouraged and built up afterward. 
    The church usually takes on a new sense of seriousness and vision for living 
    for God. Those struggling with sin usually report that they were strengthened 
    by the experience. Those being disciplined are often the ones most blessed 
    by the experience. Many of our leaders today, even at the highest levels in 
    our church, point to the time when they were disciplined as the key turning 
    point in their lives, and the event God used to rescue them from a destructive 
    sin habit. </font></p>

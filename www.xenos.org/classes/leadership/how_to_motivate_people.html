<p>Before considering how to motivate people, we have to settle two important questions.
What is a motivated person? What is motivation in the Christian context? The answer we
give to these questions will absolutely limit and channel our efforts to motivate others.
My suggested definition of motivation is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <b><p>People are motivated when they are <u>convinced</u> of the <u>correctness</u> and
  the <u>urgency</u> of Christian goals to the extent that they are eager to <u>act</u>, and
  <u>keep acting</u>, to reach those goals <u>regardless of what others do or think</u>.</p>
  </b>
</blockquote>
<p>

<b></b>While the early stages of motivation may need to include emotional support from
others to promote action, we cannot say that people are motivated in the true sense unless
they carry on for their own reasons, with, or without support from others. Likewise, those
who act without understanding why may be motivated in the world, but not in the biblical
sense. Unless we work through people's understanding and consent, we may be manipulating
rather than motivating.</p>

<h3><b>A. Convincing people our goals are right</b></h3></font><ul>

  <font face="Times" size="4"></font></b><font size="3" face="Times">Instruction- </font></li>

<ul>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <font face="Times">
        </font>
        <li>They must understand what our goals are, and why we hold them. </li>
        <li>They should be able to articulate reasons for their direction</li>
        <li>They should understand and know Scripture that teaches specifically on goals they are
          pursuing.</li>
        <li>Therefore, a good discipler understands the theory of Christian growth and ministry at a
          deep level</li>
        <li>A good motivator tells them what is right, but also shows them how to get it for
          themselves</li>
        <li>Includes wisdom in application of biblical principles to their lives:<ul>
            <li>Preparation&#151;Motivating others requires time reflecting about the person present state
              and needed change. In prayer, we ask God what the next steps should be in the person's
              life should be.</li>
            <li>A good analogy is building a fire. You don't strike the match until you have gathered
              all the things you need&#151;kindling, small sticks, larger wood.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>We often see people doing things they don't understand because of the personal
          magnetism of a leader. This is inadequate, and dangerous. Always try to make sure people
          understand what they are doing and why.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
  <font face="Times">
  <li>Persuasion-</li>

<ul>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <font face="Times">
        </font>
        <li>Just because the Bible teaches something doesn't mean people will necessarily
          accept it.</li>
        <li>The skillful discipler is a persuader who is able to convince others using<ul>
            <li>Good arguments</li>
            <li>Good antitheses</li>
            <li>Good illustrations</li>
            <li>Good demeanor</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Again, we should never see people doing things they don't want to because of social
          pressure or magnetic personalities</li>

<h3>B. Convincing people of the urgency of our goals</h3>
</b></font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Times">Modeling: </font></li>
  <ul><ul>
    <ul>
      <font face="Times">
        </font>
        <li>Some models are followed and some are not. Why?</li>
        <li>Why do some models create more excitement for their way of life than others?</li>
        <li>One reason is now much integrity people perceive in a model. Models with more perceived
          integrity will be followed more than others.</li>
        <li>Another issue is whether people perceive that a model's way of life leads to reward or
          to punishment. Studies show that people will not usually follow models they perceive as
          being punished for their way of life.</li>
        <li>Another issue is that people follow models who are passionate more than those who are
          unemotional about their way of life. Learn to put passion into your life, and you will
          become a more influential leader.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li><font face="Times">Direct influence</font></li>
  <ul><ul>
    <ul>
      <font face="Times">
        </font><li>
        <b>Visionizing</b>&#151;We spend time imagining with God how the other person could enjoy a
          better future&#151;This involves thinking about the other when we are not with them and
          intercessory prayer.</li>
        <li>Scripture teaches that we may have to <b>call</b> people to move out on what they know
          is right. We cannot always assume people will take hints, or draw the right conclusions.
          Scripture and experience show that leaders need to sometimes make specific requests of
          people before they will act.</li>
        <li>
        <b>Challenging</b> people indirectly is evident in Christ and Paul's ministries. For
          instance, Paul would tell about his own life and values, or point out the good works of
          the churches in Macedonia (2 Cor. 8)</li>
        <li>
        <b>Reading response</b> When challenging or calling someone, the leader is sensitive enough
          to read how they are responding. Based on that response, the leader either withdraws or
          advances.<ul>
            <li>Returning to our analogy of building a fire, we see a fair comparison. A small fire that
              is sputtering should not have more fuel added. Only when we sense the fire is advancing do
              we add more sticks. Likewise, leaders learn to move toward responsiveness with more ideas
              for progressing, and to retreat from unresponsiveness.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>Exhorting</b> When we encourage those who are moving along lines that will result in
          spiritual growth, it helps express the importance we place on these goals, and adds to the
          person's emotional strength to continue</li>

<h3>C. Problem resolution&#151;overcoming hurdles to motivation</h3>

</b></font><ul><ul><ul>
  <ul>
    <font size="4">
      <b>
        </b></font>
        <li>Scripture teaches we may need to reprove or rebuke in addition to instructing and
          calling</li>
        <li>Prepare for reproof by carefully thinking about each of the following:<br>
          &#150;Reasons why the person needs to have a change of heart<br>
          &#150;Measures the person can take to overcome a sin problem<br>
          &#150;Consequences that will result if the person fails to change<br>
          &#150;Benefits that will result if the person does change<br>
          &#150;Vision for what the person can be if they mature </li>
        <li>Choose a place and time&#151;not in public, not where interruptions will occur</li>
        <li>Adjust for retiring or compliant vs. resistant personalities<ul>
            <li>Ironically, we may need more directiveness for retiring personalities, and less for
              resistant personalities</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Whether we are calling or rebuking someone, we should always do it with respect for the
          person's individuality, never with pestering or brow-beating</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>D. Nurturing On-going Motivation</h3>

</b></font><ul><ul><ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <font size="4">
        <b>
        <font face="Times"></font></b></font>When people continue to act but are no longer reinforced much, a
          crisis may result. The person faces the question of why they are living this way if no one
          appreciates it. This crisis may be very acute if most of their motivation has been based
          on human emotional support, if they have little understanding of why they do what they do,
          or little personal conviction</li>
        <li>At this point, we may need to enter into a counseling process to help the person
          understand his or her own feelings as they shift away from wrong to right motivational
          base. This period is really a weaning process, where people learn to live based on what
          God wants rather than for social reasons.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

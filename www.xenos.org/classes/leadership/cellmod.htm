<p><font size="+1">This paper is part of the <a href="index.htm" target="_top">Introduction 
  To Christian Leadership</a> course taught annually at Xenos.</font></p>
<h3><font size="+1">I. Description</font></h3>
<p><font size="+1">Xenos leaders usually approach the task of discipleship in 
  the home group through a combination of one-on-one mentoring, and small, same-sexed 
  study groups called &quot;cell groups&quot; or men's' or women's' 
  study groups. Xenos cell groups are different than cell groups in other churches. 
  In most churches, cell groups are the basic home-based group in the church. 
  But in Xenos, the main home group is the <a href="../../homegroups/why-what-how-theory.htm">home 
  church</a>, and cell groups are smaller, single-sexed groups. This pattern is 
  similar to that used in the early Wesleyan movement, where they held societies, 
  classes, and bands. The bands were single-gender small groups for discipleship.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Cell groups serve a combined role of friendship building, mutual 
  support and training, or discipleship. For all these roles, the groups need 
  to be small. Three to eight people is best, although some are getting good results 
  with larger groups, especially when practicing team leadership. Student cells 
  are commonly larger than adult cells. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We believe we can maximize the effectiveness of discipleship 
  through cell groups. The members of a cell group usually disciple one another, 
  resulting in group, or community, discipleship. This brings in dynamics not 
  found in traditional one-on-one discipleship. Leaders and older believers can 
  engage in one-on-one discipleship with key members of their cell groups at the 
  same time, resulting in more complete discipleship.</font></p>
<h3><font size="+1">II. Composition</font></h3>
<p><font size="+1">The members should be good walking Christians or new believers 
  who have indicated a desire to commit to the Home Church. In cases where a new 
  person is not sure what he wants to do, it is usually best to point out that 
  he is welcome to, &quot;check out cell for awhile and see if he likes it.&quot; 
  This leaves the question of permanent membership open, in case you need to bring 
  the subject up again.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Some leaders run cell groups for uncommitted members, or even 
  nonChristians. However, the results from these kind of groups have been ambivalent. 
  We only recommend this approach in home groups where outreach or follow up are 
  severe problems, or in some student groups. At Xenos, most of our meetings are 
  open to nonChristians, so we feel cell groups are one time when believers can 
  focus on deeper issues.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you do initiate an uncommitted group, you should not later 
  change it to a committed group unless all of the members explicitly agree to 
  such a change from the heart. In other words, to change the rules for a group 
  after recruiting people with a different understanding is like changing the 
  rules in the middle of the game. An easy way to avoid this is to announce from 
  the beginning that the low-commitment cell is going to run for 6 weeks (or whatever) 
  and then the leaders will reevaluate. This gives the option of either continuing 
  as before or moving to a new format. Another way to change to a higher commitment 
  group is to announce that the new group is starting, and offering all members 
  an opportunity to join if they accept the new conditions. Allow those who don't 
  want more commitment to continue meeting in the existing group. Considering 
  that committed groups are best for discipleship, while open groups are better 
  for outreach and follow up, what is the priority in your home group?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Membership is usually same-sex because this leads to more freedom 
  to share honestly. Mixed cells have also been tried, with mixed results. Today 
  all Xenos cells are single-sexed. This is usually the only opportunity for men 
  and women to meet, and many believe it leads to better same-sexed relationships 
  in the home group.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Cell groups are usually led by either home group leaders or 
  those who may become home group leaders soon. Today, the most common pattern 
  for cell leadership is team leadership, although we should not view this as 
  a requirement. If practical, team leadership enhances leadership training by 
  giving new leaders experience in front-line leadership. Even in single-leader 
  cell groups we recommend moving toward an assistant leader as soon as possible. 
  People who do well leading a cell group are almost always good home group leaders.</font></p>
<h3><font size="+1">III. Origination</font></h3>
<p><font size="+1">To start a cell group you normally join an existing cell group 
  and work with the existing leadership toward building a &quot;cell within a 
  cell.&quot; When you reach the appropriate level of composition you divide the 
  large cell into two cells. This method of cell group replication has worked 
  well in Xenos, leading to well over 300 operating cells. You can also start 
  a cell group by beginning with a one-on-one meeting and adding others.</font></p>
<h3><font size="+1">IV. Tactical Considerations</font></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">A. Logistics -- Don't overlook the importance of a good 
    meeting place and good atmosphere for your meetings. These are especially 
    important for new members. When people come to a group they are impacted by 
    the over-all experience, not just by the teaching etc.</font> </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">1. The meeting place</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">a. The meeting place should be at a private home in most 
        cases. An institutional setting is not conducive to good fellowship unless 
        it is very comfortable and &quot;homey.&quot; Business conference rooms 
        have been used with some success, but we should realize that business 
        people associate conference rooms with doing business, not with building 
        deep relationships. We associate homes, on the other hand, with family 
        and friends. Also, as the next point suggests, homes lend themselves to 
        social time and recreation after the meeting. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">b. If possible, have the meeting at a place that will 
        be suitable for socializing afterward. Some groups move to another location 
        after the meeting, although this is not preferable, because you may lose 
        people in transit and the ones most easily lost are the new members you 
        are trying hardest to win. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">c. Consider holding cell around a table. This setting 
        provides for maximum concentration and direct involvement by all. It may 
        be necessary to obtain or build a large table, or to pull tables together 
        beforehand. If you decide to hold your meeting in couches, make sure they 
        aren't too far apart. People usually need to be facing each other 
        and close together in order to feel engaged during a discussion. Crowding 
        is not a bad thing in a cell group, but disengagement is a clear danger, 
        and could cause the cell group to feel more like a Bible club than a gathering 
        of close friends. Avoid using uncomfortable chairs.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">d. The meeting place should be air conditioned in the 
        summer, and not too warm in the winter. Warm temperatures lead to drowsiness. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">e. Be sure to have coffee ready before the meeting. Cell 
        members who have a coffee will likely be more attentive and less drowsy. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">f. Allow half an hour for talking and warm up before 
        gathering the group together. Most successful groups periodically schedule 
        activities together before the meeting like cookouts, dinner at a restaurant, 
        or a special treat. These activities can be significant in building a 
        sense of community in the group. Leaders should be there early to greet 
        members as they arrive and set a positive, welcoming tone.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">2. The meeting time</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">Cell meetings should be held at a time when members can 
        put together 4-5 hours. For most groups in Xenos today, this means cell 
        groups meet on weekend evenings, especially Friday nights. Weekend mornings 
        have also been tried. If you meet on a work night, try to start your meeting 
        no later than 7:00. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">3. During the meeting</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">a. Go ahead with the meeting at start time, even if some 
        are absent at first. The others will come on time when they hear that 
        a good thing is going on. Starting late teaches members to be late.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">b. Cell groups should include both instruction and interaction. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">c. During periods of instruction, be sure to keep it 
        interesting. Leadership should be well prepared for the instruction and 
        show their excitement for the subject. To hold your members' attention 
        and build convictions, your teaching will need to be passionate. Just 
        because the group is small doesn't mean you don't have to be 
        fiery, upbeat, funny, and challenging. The cell leader may need to stand 
        periodically and walk around in order to hold attention. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">d. During interactive periods, the leader needs to guide 
        discussion while not discouraging creative sharing. Cell groups should 
        not be held to a rigid outline. Invite interruptions. Alternate between 
        short periods of teaching and discussion. This is called leader-guided 
        or moderated group discussion. The usual pattern is that the leader teaches 
        partly by lecture, or at least offers an introduction and conclusion. 
        While you can expect some peer-to-peer interaction, most of the interaction 
        will be from learners to the leader or the group in general. The leader 
        offers a short summary and comment to most, or all, sharing. These summaries 
        should crystallize what was said, and stimulate further thinking. [See 
        an expanded coverage of this material in the class outlines for <a href="../discussion/index.htm">Leading 
        Guided Discussion</a>]</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">e. The leader will normally introduce &quot;probes&quot; 
        or questions intended to prod members toward a particular line of thought. 
        However, <b>discussion is not recitation</b>. Recitation is when the instructor 
        gives students an opportunity to clarify content or asks questions requiring 
        specific knowledge of study content, frequently from assigned readings 
        (like the teacher in &quot;The Paper Chase&quot;). We are not suggesting 
        such recitation is wrong or harmful, and in fact, cell group is one venue 
        where a measured amount of recitation may be helpful. For instance, members 
        can review findings from previous weeks which can lead to better retention. 
        However, be aware that recitation can be intimidating to new members. 
        Read the situation. Creative discussion focuses not on specific answers 
        the leader wants to hear, but on questions of <i><b>interpretation</b></i>, 
        <i><b>opinion</b></i>, and <i><b>experience</b></i>. The following are 
        types of probes suggested in this author's class on guided discussion: 
        </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="+1">Set up an apparent contradiction in your introduction, 
          and ask the group how it might be resolved </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">Ask them how a particular truth might apply either 
          to life in general, or to specific situations you imagine </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">Give them a statement from a third party (either imaginary 
          or an authority) and ask them to react to it </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">Ask how someone from x, y, or z perspective would answer 
          a particular question (see an example in this <a href="pomoevang.html">postmodern 
          response exercise</a>)</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">Set up a real life situation (where principles often 
          don't apply neatly) and ask how the principle might apply in that 
          situation. Ask for exceptions. </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">Ask if what you just distilled from a text or narrative 
          is different or the same as something else with which they are already 
          familiar (e.g. Is this teaching about letting each person have their 
          own conviction from Rom. 14 different in any way from relativism?) </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">Devil's advocacy: challenge a position they all 
          seem to accept axiomatically with some problems. This will help them 
          see the weakness in their position and think the issues through more 
          carefully. </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">Discovery: What do you think this passage is really 
          saying? </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">Personal experience: Who wants to share an experience 
          where this truth has made a difference? </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">Comparing and contrasting: Asking members to compare 
          and contrast concepts, theories, and individuals' biographies in the 
          Bible helps to clarify the relationships within a content area. After 
          learning the particulars in a field of knowledge, the next stage in 
          learning is to progressively differentiate and relate the new particulars 
          to existing particulars. </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="+1">f. To enhance your discussion-leading ability, consider 
        taking the Xenos course in &quot;<a href="../discussion/index.htm">Teaching 
        Through Guided Discussion</a>.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">g. Cell leaders should not fail to get into Scripture 
        or related content. Sometimes cell group discussions may deteriorate into 
        counseling sessions or arguments over peripheral issues. While we wouldn't 
        argue that such discussions are always bad, leaders need to be able to 
        steer the group back to biblical content. Members may report that they 
        enjoy these discussions, but the take-home value is often not sufficient 
        to build members up. Experience shows that groups where leaders fail to 
        focus on Scripture and learning at least for a good part of the evening 
        tend to lose members' interest. If members have counseling needs, 
        they may have to wait until after the time in the Bible. In some cases, 
        they could wait until after the group breaks up.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">h. When teaching basic truths for the sake of the new 
        members, remind the older members that they will probably want to be able 
        to repeat the material soon in their own cell groups, and should therefore 
        be interested for different reasons. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">i. Avoid going too long on the meeting. Although cell 
        groups can go longer than normal large meetings, set your goal at no more 
        than an hour and a half. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">4. Prayer: Corporate prayer is one of the most important 
      opportunities in a cell group. Members often gain important experience in 
      corporate prayer, and learn the importance of prayer from their cell groups. 
      To enhance your prayer time consider the following points. </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="+1">a. Prayer should be real and edifying. Teach the group 
        the difference between individual prayer and group prayer. In individual 
        prayer, we may belabor points of interest to ourselves (about my aunt's 
        medical condition), but of little interest to others. In group prayer, 
        Paul says &quot;Let everything be done for edification.&quot; (That is, 
        for edification of others. I Cor. 14:26). Teach older Christians to view 
        cell group prayer as an opportunity to bring new Christians into the rich 
        experience of corporate prayer. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">b. Don't confuse good prayer with long prayer. Some 
        older members may want to pray long prayers that are boring to newer members, 
        and may even be attention-getting. In any event, such long or theological 
        prayers are insensitive to the need of the moment and they intimidate 
        new members. In corporate prayer, we hope to &quot;feed off&quot; one 
        another and develop a dynamic spiritual interaction.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">c. Teach your members to affirm one another's prayers 
        verbally as described in I Cor. 14:16. Verbal affirmation leads to a feeling 
        of participation which encourages prayer.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">d. Be sure to focus early in your prayer time on thanksgiving 
        and praise. Avoid excessive negativity during prayer times. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">e. Many groups pray for outreach opportunities, which 
        gives all members an opportunity to become aware of what God may be doing 
        in the home group, and stresses the importance of outreach. Consider keeping 
        a prayer list for outreach opportunities.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">f. Answered prayers should always be pointed out to the 
        group, with reminders that praying makes a difference. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">g. Read the situation: if people are interested in praying, 
        let them pray. But if the meeting has gone too long and people are sluggish 
        about prayer, you may want to bring it to a close before creating a negative 
        association in the minds of members. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">5. After the meeting</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">a. Much of the best ministry in a cell group occurs <i><b>after 
      the meeting</b></i>. Leaders should strenuously avoid leaving soon after 
      the meeting, as this communicates either disinterest, or at least, low priority 
      on spending time with members of the group. Only on rare occasions should 
      leaders leave immediately, and then only with apologies. Work to build a 
      consensus that the time after the meeting is the best part of the evening. 
      These times serve to transform the group into a community, rather than simply 
      a class. </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">b. Have drinks and/or food on hand beforehand, or have 
      someone make a run. Know what you plan to do afterward. Avoid sitting around 
      asking, &quot;What shall we do?&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">c. Consider adjourning to a fire, a deck, or other conversational 
      setting with low lighting after the meeting. While going out to a movie 
      or playing games is sometimes good, the most ideal activities are those 
      which accommodate conversation. This is your chance to have good talks with 
      your cell members. Youth cells may need more stimulating activities, but 
      continue to look for opportunities for good discussions.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">d. Avoid simply ending the meeting and continuing to sit 
      around your table chatting. Unless the group moves to another area, it will 
      seem like the meeting is lasting for 6 hours. </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">e. The ability to relax and talk in a humorous vein, or 
      to share insightful thoughts about secular matters is essential during this 
      period. Cell leaders have to balance time between making sure that no one 
      is being ignored, and engaging one or more members in a relatively deep 
      conversation. Hopefully others in the group spontaneously join in meeting 
      needs during this period, but if not, they may need some one-on-one training. 
      </font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
  <h3><font size="+1">C. Meeting Format</font></h3>
  
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">There are a number of successful formats for a cell group. 
      Don't follow a format rigidly. Let the meeting be based on your own assessment 
      of the need of the moment. Typically, a cell might include the following 
      sections: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="+1">Section 1--1/2 hour general talk <br>
        Section 2--1 to 1 1/2 hours content-study-discussion<br>
        Section 3--1/4-1/2 hour sharing and prayer <br>
        Section 4--2 to 4 hours recreation <br>
        = Approximately 3-6 hours</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1"><b>Section 1 </b>-- During the time people are arriving 
      we should be trying to establish an atmosphere of warmth and getting members 
      used to talking. Practice warm greetings that express your happiness to 
      see members. </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1"><b>Section 2 </b>-- The leader should carefully sense the 
      endurance and interest of the group, and respond accordingly. The meeting 
      proper should be terminated <i>while people are still interested</i>, not 
      after they have been worn out. It is a mistake to go too long on the teaching 
      and prayer, and thus leave a bad taste in the members' mouth. Never 
      prolong a meeting when you see that the members have lost concentration. 
      You can always finish your outline the next week. </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Be patient with your members. It may take time to see them 
      put into practice what you taught. Remember how long it took you to become 
      consistent in these areas. On the other hand, members who seem to be putting 
      forth no effort are candidates for admonition. </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">When teaching topically using lists of scripture, always 
      demonstrate with each passage that the context justifies the use you are 
      making of the passage. Study of the context helps to teach interpretive 
      skills while it also aids memory. This also teaches that proof-texting is 
      not the right way to use the Bible.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">If members are advanced enough and/or motivated enough, 
      you can suggest memory work or books to read. However, it would be a great 
      mistake to insist on memory or reading work from people who are not yet 
      to the place where they want to do such work. Instead, offer appropriate 
      work for those who want it, or ask whether anyone wants to do memory work 
      or reading. </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">In any case, be prepared for any suggested &quot;assignment&quot; 
      to go undone. If this happens, realize that your members are not yet motivated 
      to work in this area, and let it lie. Don't patronize your members 
      by rebuking them for not doing homework.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">We don't recommend tests or quizzes for cells unless 
      the members of the cell directly state that they want to be tested. Tests 
      suggest an atmosphere of competition, which works against the community 
      feeling you want in cell.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1"><b>Section 3 -- </b>Consider praying specifically for needs 
      in the Home Church and in each others' lives--carrying out an intercessory 
      ministry (Eph. 6:18). Also, uninhibited prayer is best, verbally affirming 
      the things said, as the Scripture suggests (I&nbsp;Cor.14:16), so that the 
      members come to appreciate the prayer experience. <br>
      <br>
      Try to guide the group into sharing that is personal and spiritual, but 
      not overly self-centered. Cultivate the expectation that the prayer time 
      will be ministered to by God directly through the Holy Spirit. </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1"><b>Section 4</b> -- Don't scrimp on time during the social 
      period. If some of the members want to leave early, fine. It should also 
      be possible for the others to stay. Avoid having the leader be the one calling 
      for an early end to the social time (unless you have seen them through to 
      2:00 AM!). </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Remember that there is a limit to the amount of &quot;heavy&quot; 
      thinking and relating that most people can tolerate at one time, without 
      becoming restless and overburdened. The thrust of the recreation period 
      should be relaxation and enjoying each other. Any further &quot;heaviness&quot; 
      should only be at the request of the members. </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">You, as leader should show the way into good recreation 
      and relaxation, including all of the things normally associated with those 
      states (humor, reminiscence, talk of the opposite sex, sports, etc.). This 
      amounts to a demonstration of Christian liberty in the context of Christian 
      love. As such, it carries an important message to the others. </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Your basis for effective ministry is your ability to develop 
      love relationships with your cell group. Memorable shared experiences and 
      good conversations help build good relationships. Routine TV watching or 
      card playing are much less suitable to this task. </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">As time goes on, cell group weekends are a good idea. Again, 
      we are trying to provide for the development of unity and identity within 
      the cell group. Be affectionate and loyal to your people. Anyone who can 
      lead an effective cell group has most of the basic skills needed to lead 
      a Home Church.</font></p>

<h3><font size="+1">V</font><font size="+1">. Members' Spiritual Condition</font></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">Good cell leaders are constantly watching and praying for 
    their members. Leaders need to assess: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">1. Whether the membership is mostly young in the Lord, 
        equally mixed, or mostly established believers. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">2. The level of commitment and the prevailing attitude. 
        Is the group eager to meet, and excited about the things of God? </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">3. Signs of boredom, low level of participation (including 
        both discussion and prayer). Notice members who don't speak and pray 
        for insight on how to stimulate them without pressure. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">4</font><font size="+1">. Evidence of closeness in relationships. 
        Are the members associating at times other than regular meetings? Do they 
        enjoy each other? Are they concerned about each others' lives? Or 
        are they disengaged?</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">5. Notice how long people tend to stay afterward. If 
        your cell group clears out soon after the meeting this suggests low interest 
        level in social involvement. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">6. Always be ready to upgrade the composition of the 
        group. If you have problem members, try to keep their behavior within 
        the tolerable limits for the group. Antisocial or self-centered behavior 
        has more impact in a smaller group than it would in a large group. Cell 
        leaders have the authority to maintain discipline in a group, including 
        removing members, but use it judiciously. The home church leadership team 
        should agree with discipline of this kind.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">7</font><font size="+1">. Be aware of the differences 
        between people. Use questions like those found in the paper &quot;Ministry 
        Evaluation&quot; to determine what is realistic progress from each member 
        of the group.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">8</font><font size="+1">. In most groups, there are one 
        or two who stand out as likely to become leaders. These should receive 
        additional leadership training outside of the cell. We should also ask 
        them to help with the younger members of the group. Normally, the older 
        members help disciple the younger members of the cell. Upcoming leaders 
        can be asked to guest teach periodically in order to gain experience. 
        However, I believe we should not establish a &quot;teaching rotation&quot; 
        in cell groups that includes non-leaders. This seems advisable for two 
        reasons: 1) For motivational reasons, people need to understand that they 
        can teach regularly when they have their own cell groups. 2) Since Cell 
        group is the main locus of discipleship in home groups, we need our best 
        and deepest teaching at cell group. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">9</font><font size="+1">. Other members should learn 
        to become effective backup workers, or service ministers. The ultimate 
        goal of the cell leader should be to multiply <i>balanced ministry environments</i> 
        that will contain all types of workers, trained and equipped to do the 
        &quot;work of service.&quot;</font></p>

<h3><font size="+1">VI. Strategy</font></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">The first thing a cell group leader needs is a strategic 
    framework or vision within which to plan. Obtaining this vision is made more 
    difficult because for most of us, the cell group is meeting more than one 
    need. We not only need to identify what we are trying to do, but to prioritize 
    our goals in terms of sequence, or order of operations.</font></p>
  <h3><font size="+1">A. Things Cell groups accomplish include:</font></h3>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">1. Winning new Christians into their membership</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">2. Caring for the weak members of the group</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">3. Teaching its members basic Christian living and worldview 
      (grounding in the Word)</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">4. Providing members help and opportunity to build relationships 
      with each other</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">5. Providing rudimentary counseling and guidance in Christian 
      living as needed</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">6. Providing motivation and creating vision in the minds 
      of the members for serving Christ</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">7. Helping each member to develop their own ministry, including, 
      for most, winning their own disciples</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">8. Providing a venue where young Christians can get supervised 
      experience serving others, as well as coaching on sharing the gospel, and 
      responding to challenges to their faith, and other ministry opportunities</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">9. Training new leaders for the home church</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">Can you think of any other significant tasks cell groups 
        should accomplish? </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Can you see any unnecessary or expendable tasks on this 
        list? </font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <h3><font size="+1">B. Life Cycles of Cells</font></h3>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">As we do the types of work described above, the cell will 
      hopefully move through a life-cycle resulting in cell multiplication. The 
      following are imaginary levels people could be at relative to ministry, 
      discipleship, and duplication.</font></p>
    <p><img src="../../graphics/minlevels.gif" width="407" height="333"></p>
    <p><font size="+1">As cell members move through these imaginary levels of 
      growth, our discipleship challenge changes. Usually, we have members at 
      various stages of growth, so our teaching has to be flexible. Hopefully, 
      we have at least one person reaching the higher levels of growth, enabling 
      us to plant a new cell group. </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Point &quot;X&quot; is the moment of birth, the dividing 
      point between assisting and training others, and actually releasing them 
      as fully duplicated leaders in their own right. This point is the ultimate 
      challenge for Christian workers in cell group ministry. Even after planting 
      the new cell, time must pass to see if it succeeds. More than one attempt 
      may be needed before it becomes clear that duplication has occurred. </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Crossing Point &quot;X&quot; may take years of dedicated 
      ministry.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">After reaching Point X, a leader or leadership team is 
      ready to begin again.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3><font size="+1">VII. Content</font></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">The following are essential areas of teaching that must be 
    learned and practiced before a member could be considered well-grounded and 
    ready to lead his or her own cell group. Remember, for each area, we need 
    to see that they are actually practicing the truth, not just learning to think 
    about it.</font></p>

      <p><font size="+1">3. Bibliology, Hermeneutics and Bible Study Methods&#151;Unless 
        our disciples have a high view of Scripture, know why they hold that view,

        on this list. If you have taken these classes and retained good notes, 
        you should be ready to serve up interesting teachings. Likewise, a wise 
        leader will make every effort to interest cell members in taking these 
        classes, <i>but the classes are never enough</i>. Learners must also work 
        with the concepts in the context of discussion, and must learn to use 
        and defend biblical truth on their own. They must learn to practice principles 
        of Christian living in real life. The cell group is perfect for this part 
        of their training. Repetition is also key to final retention and practice 
        of deep theological truth.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">2. Consider using an expository approach to the same 
        material. As the subjects come up in the course of book studies, you can 
        offer short topical coverage. Seeing how systematic and practical theology 
        comes up in the course of Bible reading helps learners retain the information, 
        as well as learning how to integrate their Bible reading. Since the Principles 
        classes use a topical approach to the subject matter, cell group is a 
        good opportunity to use exposition.</font></p>

      a healthy diet for all.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">D. Higher levels of ministry.</font> </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">By the time some members of the cell have been in the group 
      for a year and a half to three years, they should be relatively informed 
      on all of the subject areas mentioned above, especially if they have taken 
      Christian Principles and Servanthood classes.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Another goal during this period is to involve the more 
      advanced disciples in ministry efforts calculated to issue in a fruitful 
      ministry of their own. Frequently, a good place to start is within the cell 
      group. Let the older believers help out with the ministry needed for the 
      young members. They should ideally focus on new members that they have personally 
      brought into the home church. It may be necessary to spend considerable 
      time outside of cell group coaching your disciples on how to succeed in 
      their new ministries. This coaching would include what and how to teach, 
      how best to motivate their people, what goals they should have, and how 
      to handle problems that come up in the other's life.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">In the context of this sort of life, (involved in basic 
      personal Christian work done under the supervision of the cell leaders) 
      the teaching process is ready to continue to the final level. This situation 
      is called Point &quot;X&quot; in Fig.&nbsp;1. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3><font size="+1">VIII. Reaching &quot;Point X&quot;</font></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">Consider what we hope to see in a believer who has reached 
      Point X. Such a believer should be one who could be called &quot;mature&quot; 
      (1 Cor. 2:6) or &quot;complete in Him&quot; (Col. 1:28). The <a href="discipleship.html">Discipleship 
      Outline</a> covers these areas in much more detail. These are some of the 
      things we would hope to see in such a one.</font> </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">1. <b>Knowledge of the Word</b>. This area must include 
        not only doctrine and text location knowledge, but also interpretation, 
        handling problem passages, Bible history, Bible survey, and relevant opposing 
        schools of interpretation. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">2. <b>Application of the Word</b>. This includes application 
        of the Word to others as well as one's self.</font> </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="+1">a) <b>Self</b>: they have been counseled through sin 
          areas, relational problems, temperamental weaknesses, and have developed 
          a comprehensive Christian world view.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">b) <b>Others</b>: They must have learned to think Biblically 
          about other's lives. They must have learned judgment in applying the 
          Word to others (i.e. they must be able to prioritize goals, knowing 
          what to confront, and what to ignore).</font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">c) <b>Methods</b>: They have learned sound ministry 
          methods along with the reasons for using those methods. </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">d) <b>Discernment</b>: They must learn discernment 
          and tact-- the ability to &quot;read&quot; the response of another. 
          </font></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">3. <b>Relational life</b>. Mature disciples must successfully 
      build relational lives that will be a basis for stable service for years 
      to come. In many cases, this involves building a solid marriage, and it 
      always means stable and deep peer relationships.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Attaining the above goals will probably involve two to 
      five years or more of healthy growth. As a cell group leader, you must agonize 
      over how you can help impart these qualities to your members. Review the 
      areas, and ask God how you can supply them the tools needed to facilitate 
      God instilling each quality. Obviously, we can only do our part. God has 
      to move people to feed themselves in addition to what we offer as leaders. 
      But we should do the best we can. Draw up a chart or extended outline, listing 
      each quality, and your idea for transmission strategy in each case.</font></p>

<h3><font size="+1">IX. Planting the New Cell Group</font></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">Be sure to work well ahead of time with your fellow leaders 
    in the home church when planning the new cell group plant. Your other home 
    church leaders must agree on who the leaders of the new group will be, and 
    on the membership of both groups. How you plant your cell bears directly on 
    how the home church will later be planted. These are legitimate concerns for 
    the entire home group, and group discernment should bear out any impressions 
    you already have. Read the paper, <a href="hcmang.html">Leading Home Church 
    Growth</a> for ideas on how to work with your fellow leaders in this area 
    of planning. Consider the following when planting:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="A">
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">1. If you are planting with a leadership team, rather than 
      individual leadership, try to combine two leaders whose gifts and weakness 
      tend to offset each other. </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">2. Each new cell group should have possible future leaders, 
      as well as those with outreach potential. In other words, the cell should 
      have both high end and low end potential.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">3. Try to have a range of personality types and gifting 
      in the new cell as well as the old. Each cell group should be a balanced 
      ministry environment.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">4. Normally, there should be lines of influence or discipleship 
      that make the new cell plant more or less automatic for all but one or two. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">5. Student groups that have ministry houses should align 
      their ministry houses with their cell groups.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">6. A group of fewer than five members risks having weeks 
      when one or two fail to show up, and the group feels depressed about having 
      only two or three present. Five or more members is best for creating a good 
      critical mass for the group, although this is not always necessary.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">Building and planting a cell group is one of the most difficult 
    and rewarding ministries a person can have. When we do this work well, we 
    have built a solid foundation for a new home church. We have also built quality 
    into the home church for years to come. Our best leaders can build and plant 
    cell groups every two to three years, but even four, five, or six years would 
    not be out of the question for accomplishing a ministry of this scope and 
    difficulty. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The first thing leaders have to settle on is the definition 
  of follow up. DON&quot;T SKIP THIS STEP! See the paper, <a href="hcfoll.htm">Home 
  Church Follow Up</a> and consider carefully the difference between legitimate 
  biblical follow up and manipulation. Your task as a leader is to facilitate 
  good follow up, not to foster a manipulative social environment. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To facilitate good follow up, you will need to do the following:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font size="+1">Monitor and assess the quality of follow up in the home 
    church</font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Train members in successful follow up methods</font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Motivate good follow up through your words and deeds</font></li>
</ol>
<h3><font size="+1">Monitoring and assessing follow up</font></h3>
<p><font size="+1">A good way to understand your home church's success in follow 
  up is to compare the number of first time guests to the group with the number 
  of those guests returning for additional visits since the last time your church 
  planted. These returning guests are called &quot;returning new&quot; in the 
  graphs provided by the Xenos office. The comparison between first time guests 
  and returning new people is not a completely accurate measure of follow up success, 
  but experience shows that this ratio generally correlates well with successful 
  follow up efforts. Notice the following about this comparison:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font size="+1">Your returning new people will not include those who may 
    have visited only two or three times before planting your current home church, 
    even though such guests are still the object of follow up efforts. Of course 
    as the home church moves further into it's cycle (and away from the time of 
    planting) this fact diminishes in importance. The main result is that the 
    follow up ratio is more accurate further into the the home cycle.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Some of those shown as returning new people may not be won 
    in any sense. They may be non Christians, or completely uncommitted believers 
    who continue to visit on a tentative basis. This means again that the follow 
    up ratio is inaccurate, because you are counting all returning new as successes, 
    whereas usually some of them are still undecided. This again results in the 
    follow up ratio becoming more accurate over time, as the uncommitted eventually 
    lose interest.</font><font size="+1"><br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">In spite of these anomalies, the follow up ratio is a helpful 
    measure because it is objective, easy to measure, and allows us to compare 
    results between home churches. Since the ratio is assessed comparatively, 
    the inaccuracy, especially in the early weeks of a home church, are unimportant. 
    Be prepared for your follow up ratio to decline after the first few weeks 
    of your current home church cycle.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">In general, adult groups should seek a follow up ratio no 
    worse than 4:1 (4 first time guests for each returning new person). However, 
    this goal could change depending on the group's outreach level. If the group 
    has low outreach, (first time guests equal to less than 10% of your total 
    attendance per month [i.e. 2 people per month in a home church of 20]) you 
    may want to seek an even better ratio, such as 3 or even 2 to 1. These levels 
    have been attained by adult churches with low outreach. On the other hand, 
    a home church with high outreach levels (more than 10% of the group in first 
    time guests per month) will likely fall below the 4:1 standard, even if their 
    follow up is good. Considering this model for a home group of 20, we see that 
    such a group could expect around 25 guests in a year, and that 6 of these 
    would still be attending. If original members have remained relatively steady 
    (less than 10% loss per year), such a group would have grown by 25% or more. 
    For an adult group, this would be considered good growth. Such a group would 
    double in just over 3 years.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Student home churches should generally seek a follow up 
    ratio of 5:1. The rate is lower because student groups usually have higher 
    levels of outreach (typically 20% of their total attendance per month [i.e. 
    6 first-time guests per month for a home church of 30). With outreach levels 
    twice that of adult groups, such student groups will grow rapidly, even with 
    the lower follow up rate. For instance, a group of 30 with average outreach 
    would see about 80 first timers per year. Of those 16 would still be attending 
    if they attain a 5:1 ratio. While this seems like incredible growth, we should 
    remember, that old member stability is poorer with student groups (often 20% 
    per year departing), resulting in a loss in the same group of 6 people. The 
    resulting growth would still be rapid at over 30% (doubling in 2.5 years). 
    Again, the goals should be adjusted for differences in outreach rates--the 
    more first-time guests a group has, the lower their follow up will likely 
    be.</font></li>
</ol>
<h3>Training Members in Effective Follow Up Methods</h3>
<p><font size="+1">The paper <a href="hcfoll.htm">Home Church Follow Up</a> has 
  been written to help leaders train committed members in follow up theory and 
  practice. Most of the issues you need to train on are contained in that paper, 
  and in the paper, <a href="evgcon.html">Leading Home Church Evangelism</a>. 
  Feel free to use these outlines for cell group studies. The main point is to 
  periodically have members thinking deeply about the issue of follow up, and 
  to speak passionately on the need for good follow up. Your members will be creative 
  about how to befriend guests, and how to persuade those who need it if you lead 
  the way in thinking and praying about this area.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The period we refer to as follow up often includes evangelism, 
  as people may well not make a decision for Christ until weeks or months after 
  they begin attending. To get a sense of your people's learning needs, it is 
  essential that you be present in person to watch interactions between your members 
  and guests. Try to get in position to listen to discussions after home church 
  meetings or at social events. Look for evidence of the typical extremes in your 
  people's follow up work:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font size="+1"><b>Impatience</b>. Watch for argumentative conversations 
    or excessive pressure on guests. This is common in younger groups. Teach on 
    the decision continuum.</font></li>
  <li><font size="+1"><b>Timidity</b>. Is there evidence that your people never 
    actually call for a decision? Are they hoping others will simply join because 
    of social affinity? This is hard to discern, but we should teach that eventually 
    a strong call may be necessary. Suggest ways to bring the need for decision 
    to people's attention without being pushy.</font></li>
  <li><font size="+1"><b>Omission</b>. When you see a guest sitting or standing 
    by him or herself for any length of time (especially when regular members 
    stand nearby talking to each other), you are beholding a training need in 
    the home church. Teach your people to be watching guests and taking initiative 
    in discussion. If we think it's hard to initiate discussion with a guest, 
    just imagine how much more difficult it is for the new person!</font></li>
  <li><font size="+1"><b>Self-centeredness</b>. Lazy and flabby home churches 
    may be good at outreach, but they are consistently poor at follow up. Follow 
    up is not a ministry that can be advanced at our convenience. We must be alert 
    and ready to move into the world of our guests at their convenience. Connect 
    good follow up and commitment in the mind of your people.</font></li>
</ol>
<h3>Motivating Good Follow Up</h3>
<p><font size="+1">Often the missing element in home church follow up is not information, 
  but motivation. When your assessment shows a problem with follow up, here are 
  some ideas:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font size="+1"><b>Training is motivational</b>. Don't overlook training 
    like that mentioned above under the assumption that your people already know 
    how to do follow up. You may need to repeat a study series from the year before 
    because people have forgotten your points.</font></li>
  <li><font size="+1"><b>Arrange for regular times and places for follow up</b>. 
    Your home church should either go out together after the meeting (usually 
    typical of singles and student groups) or stay at the home for a time of social 
    interaction. If staying at the house, make sure there are treats and an environment 
    conducive to conversation. The time after Central Teaching could also be good 
    for follow up.</font></li>
  <li><font size="+1"><b>Feedback</b>. Share your assessment of the home church's 
    follow up work with your people. People may not be aware that follow up is 
    a problem in your home church even when your ratio is poor. The first part 
    of building motivation is acknowledging the problem. Share negative feedback 
    in a way that avoids defeatism. Be sure to reflect faith in God's power to 
    change the situation. Also, be sure to pick an appropriate venue for sharing 
    this information. Follow up is the concern of committed members, not the guests 
    themselves. Some groups schedule special workers' meetings for this purpose. 
    In other cases, cell groups or one-on-one discussion may be appropriate. </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1"><b>Pursue change to the appropriate level of tension</b>. 
    By regularly reminding the group that they are wasting time with their outreach 
    because their follow up is poor, you will create tension on this issue. Also 
    by regularly praying about the problem in cell groups or other believers' 
    meetings and regularly sharing additional feedback you will create tension. 
    A group needs to feel a certain level of tension before change is likely.</font></li>
  <li><font size="+1"><b>Model good follow up</b>. Unlike outreach, where younger 
    Christians often excel, older Christians are often more effective at follow 
    up. Here is an area where the leaders' knowledge and experience in dealing 
    with people are at a premium. Try to arrange situations where you can do follow 
    up work in person, and if possible, have younger Christians watch how you 
    interact. Nothing would be better for training and for motivation. Afterward, 
    talk to your disciples about what you were trying to accomplish and about 
    how exciting it was.</font></li>
  <li><b><font size="+1">Teach members of your home church how to take responsibility 
    for their own sphere</font></b><font size="+1">. People should feel special 
    responsibility for those guests brought by members of their own cell group 
    or by members of a related cell group of the opposite sex. Although we should 
    all feel responsible to some extent for all guests, those in our own sphere 
    of ministry should carry a special burden. </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1"><b>Teach your members to &quot;respect the bringer.&quot;</b> 
    People should not try to recruit a guest to a ministry sphere incompatible 
    with that of the one who brought the guest. When this happens, we threaten 
    the motivation level of the church, and may even cause tension between members 
    who feel wronged. You can learn more about ministry ethics in developing ministry 
    spheres in the paper, <a href="hcmang.html">Managing Home Church Growth</a>.</font></li>
  <li><font size="+1"><b>Home churches with members seeking discipleship opportunities 
    usually have better follow up</b>. If the younger committed Christians in 
    your group are actively looking for new Christians to disciple, they will 
    be motivated to work hard at follow up. Is this a vision that appeals to your 
    disciples? </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1"><b>Discuss motivation with your supervisor</b>. Your staff 
    supervisor may have additional thoughts on how you can bring more motivation 
    to your group in the area of follow up.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1">Bringing a home church into the position where their follow 
  up is good is one of the most difficult parts of home church leadership. When 
  you see improvement here, all other phases of ministry will benefit. Be sure 
  to share the encouragement for each success. </font></p>

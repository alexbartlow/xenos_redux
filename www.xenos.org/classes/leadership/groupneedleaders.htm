<h3><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Dennis McCallum</font></h3>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I will argue repeatedly in this course that the key to success
    in ministry, as God defines success, is getting in line with what God wants
    to do, or is doing. The biblical concept of ministry is serving God or other
    people in a way that furthers God’s will or purpose. Further, true ministry
    must be <i>empowered</i> and <i>directed</i> by God. God is clear that &quot;it
    is the Spirit that quickens, the flesh profits nothing.&quot; (John 6:63)
    He warns in the Old Testament that, &quot;Unless the Lord builds the house,
    they do labor in vain that build it.&quot; (Psalms 127:1) Paul said the apostles
    were those who &quot;glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh.&quot; (Phil.
    3:3) These passages and many others all suggest the same thing: If God’s
    power moves through us in ministry, spiritual fruit will be borne. If his
    power is not animating our ministry, nothing we do will help the situation.
    (We have discussed the central role of God in ministry in the paper, <a href="godmin.html">God’s
    Part in Ministry</a>&quot;)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Over against the biblical
    teaching about the centrality of God in ministry, the Bible teaches that
    human agency is also significant.
    In each case where a church is planted in the book of Acts, one or more humans
    went to that city and were used by God to plant it. Paul teaches that God
    presents members of the Body of Christ with gifts, ministries, and effects
    for his glory, and for the common good. (1 Cor. 12:4-7) Paul goes so far
    as to say that people cannot believe unless they hear, and they can’t hear
    unless someone preaches. (Rom. 10:14) He also says God has &quot;committed
    to us the message of reconciliation.&quot; (2Cor. 5:19) </font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In other words, God wants
    to work his will through the agency of cooperating Christians servants who
    understand his ways and actively move
    out to become &quot;fellow workers with God.&quot; (1&nbsp;Cor. 3:7) The
    degree to which God has delegated the task of reaching the world to humans
    is remarkable. One important function that God expects many Christians to
    carry out for him is leadership. From one end of the Bible to the other,
    God worked through human leaders. Most of the great heroes of faith from
    Abraham to Moses to David to Paul were leaders. In the New Testament the
    role of human leader is expanded further. No longer is leadership reserved
    for kings or priests. In the Body of Christ, the apostles regularly appointed
    leadership in every locality from common people.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Jesus' observation that &quot;The harvest is plentiful but
    the workers are few,&quot; and his call to &quot;Ask the Lord of the harvest,
    therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field,&quot; both imply that
    God's intentions on earth may be thwarted by a shortage of qualified leaders.
    (Mat. 9:37,38) In order for home churches to replicate themselves, leaders
    must be raised up. Therefore, for those of us who are concerned about following
    God and seeing his will done on earth, the matter of finding and establishing
    human leadership is urgent.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Obviously, if human leadership didn't matter—if all ministry
    is up to God alone, all groups would be the same. But this is not the case.
    How often we see God’s power restricted in groups with poor leaders! Meanwhile,
    other groups seem to flourish both inwardly and in outward growth. God sends
    leaders into his flock to galvanize and excite people, reminding them of
    their mission, and firing their imagination for the future. Our tasks can
    seem routine and uninteresting when carried out without the benefit of leadership.
    Yet when a good leader arrives, those same tasks seem exciting and worthwhile.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Consider some of the implications that flow from this understanding
    of leadership:</font></p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It would be pointless
        to formulate plans, exert effort, take risks, or spend money on a ministry
        project that is not empowered
        by God. Any such project is doomed to fail spiritually, no matter how
        much outward &quot;fruit&quot; it appears to bear.</font></li>
    <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Humans can do tasks, including attracting a following,
        without any help from God. However, for those of us with a biblical perspective,
        such a following would be not only unimportant, but actually dangerous
        to our own spiritual lives and the health of the church. Those who understand
        the divine component in ministry don’t want any more following than what
        God has in mind for them.</font></li>
    <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Leaders who understand God’s part in leadership become
        more watchful, and less forceful. They realize the futility of sociologically-based
        change (changing because of group pressure or manipulation) and instead
        realize that the key to successful ministry is finding out what God is
        doing. Then the leader can cooperate with God’s direction and often maximize
        results.</font></li>
    <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Leaders who see their roles as God does are less shattered
        by failure and less elated by success. Years of serving God as leaders
        teach them that what appears a great success is often not as great as
        people think, and what seems like failure may not be as bad as supposed.
        In the face of failure, God always seems to find a way through eventually.
        At the same time, nothing is ever as easy as we thought it would be.
        The realization that ultimate responsibility for the kingdom lies with
        the king leads to stability and consistency in leadership.</font></li>
    <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The nightmare of presiding over a huge, carnally motivated
        ministry may haunt spiritually-minded leaders, while leading a small
        flock in the true power of the Spirit seems increasingly appealing. Of
        course, a spiritual leader will go where God calls him or her, whether
        to large or small flocks.</font></li>
    <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">While techniques
        and scholarship can be increasingly mastered in our lives, discerning
        the hand of God in leadership never
        gets all that easy. As a result, long-time leaders develop an increasingly
        careful and circumspective approach when deciding on direction, while
        carnally motivated leaders tend to become &quot;know-it-alls.&quot; Of
        course, all good leaders know how to move strongly and decisively once
        God’s direction has been discerned.</font></li>
    <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Biblical leaders
        are constantly scanning the people in their sphere of influence, watching
        for signs that God is moving someone
        ahead. They know the divine election plays key a role in leadership development.
        God’s gifting of believers is an indication of his plan for them in the
        body, according to 1 Cor. 12. Likewise, people often have underlying
        personal problems that are secret to all but God. These issues often
        come out only after a person is in leadership and may cause widespread
        damage. In retrospect, we sometimes realize the signs were there all
        along. Godly leaders see that the key to leadership replication involves
        a combination of faithful feeding of the flock on the one hand, while
        trying to discern who God is designating as his chosen leaders for the
        future. (See the paper &quot;<a href="whatmakesleader.htm">What Makes
        Someone a Leader?</a>&quot;)</font></li>

<p><i>[This paper is based on a team lecture given by McCallum and DeLashmutt 
  at a Xenos leaders' meeting in the 80's. At that time, some leaders were expressing 
  dismay and confusion because they had, or were, failing at in their groups.]</i></p>
<p><font size="4">The biggest problem with many of us is that we are <b><i>soft 
  from too much success</i></b>. We are like a child riding a bike on training 
  wheels who thinks he has actually learned to ride. His parents warn him, &quot;It's 
  a little harder when you take the wheels off,&quot; but until you actually do 
  take them off, the kid continues to enjoy a false sense of mastery. Once the 
  wheels come off, the child may have to endure a few nasty crackups that could 
  lead to tears, and even a refusal to ride any more. But without removing the 
  wheels, he will never learn to ride.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">In our training, failure has played a prominent role, and in 
  fact a crucial role that success never could have played. We have failed at 
  more ministry attempts than most in our church have ever tried! Bible studies, 
  personal evangelism, discipleship, and overall fellowship direction are all 
  venues where we have tasted deeply of failure, often with embarrassment and 
  disgrace. While we still don't like to fail, we increasingly realize that nothing 
  teaches us more than our failures.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="4"><i>From failure we learn what works</i> Biblical guidance 
    is important in ministry, but we are still left to apply biblical teaching 
    in area after area, and these are often judgment calls requiring wisdom and 
    experience. Success in ministry can often lead to the wrong conclusions. We 
    may conclude that because of our success, our ministry methods must be on 
    a especially correct. Meanwhile, our success may be the result of something 
    completely different. Our attribution of success to our superior methods is 
    wrong, but we usually have no way of knowing that until we fail using those 
    same &quot;miracle methods.&quot; The experience of failure throws us into 
    state of amazement and disillusionment, and this confused state of mind is 
    exactly what God needs to bring us out of our ego-driven paradigm. Only then 
    can we listen to new ideas, new ways of explaining past success, and engage 
    in original thinking for the future.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4"><i>Through failure we learn dependence</i> (2 Cor 11:30-33): 
    At the heart of our carnality in leadership is often a self-sufficient attitude. 
    Our shortchanged prayer life is a warning signal, but we find that easy to 
    ignore. Failure is much harder to ignore. As we strike off in first one direction 
    and then another, failing at each turn, God is able to corner us into conclusions 
    we weren't willing to look at before. A growing sense of ineptitude at the 
    deepest level begins to strike a note of caution in all we do. Ironically, 
    this sense of helplessness grows at the same time we know we are increasing 
    our competence in the basic skills of ministry. Such an inner tension is exactly 
    what God uses to convince us that he alone can bring us to ultimate spiritual 
    success.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4"><i>Through failure we deepen our discernment</i>: One of our 
    problems in ministry that we may be driving for the wrong goals. We often 
    assume that things which bring more results, like greater numbers, are the 
    will of God. We may think certain types of people are best suited to lead. 
    These assumptions may be partly right, but they often overlook important exceptions 
    that could lead to unfairness or corruption in the church. God often shows 
    us through failure that we are looking at things superficially and that we 
    need goals more in harmony with the deeper picture. We may realize that our 
    pragmatism leads to outward results without inward spiritual reality. At other 
    times, we may see that our super-spirituality has led us to ignore the plain 
    facts of our situation. After training in failure, some things that used to 
    impress us as guaranteed to succeed now remind us of times when similar things 
    or people were great disappointments. Our pronouncements become less dogmatic, 
    and more humble. At the same time, we may have viewed certain problems as 
    negative, but not really dangerous, until one of those problems rose up and 
    confronted us with outright failure because we ignored it. We cannot downplay 
    such problems in the future. Therefore, a leader trained by failure may become 
    concerned about things that seem less important to others.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4"><i>Through failure we learn how to minister under grace</i>: 
    Personal sin often teaches us the urgency of clinging to the grace of God 
    in our lives. In the same way, failure in ministry teaches us how urgent it 
    is that we learn to appreciate and appropriate God's grace in a living way. 
    Most of us come into ministry feeling on some level that the work depends 
    on our competence and personal charisma, and this becomes confusing, because 
    on some level our gifts and abilities <i>are</i> instrumental. God may have 
    to work with us for years to bring us to the place where we understand in 
    our heart how it can be possible that my abilities matter, and yet take no 
    sense of egotism from that fact. Most young ministers insist on taking their 
    identity from their ministry results. Usually, only profound failure will 
    convince us that &quot;apart from the vine we can do nothing,&quot; and yet 
    we need to strive all the harder. (I&nbsp;Cor&nbsp;15:10) This is the paradoxical 
    outlook of the mature worker--an outlook only accessible through a combination 
    of success and failure.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4"><i>Through failure we develop deep spiritual convictions about 
    ministry:</i> Most of us become excited about doing ministry because of the 
    thrilling experiences we have while doing it. Such profound thrills are hard 
    to find apart from illicit drugs, romance, or materialistic advancement. On 
    one level, God must approve of our feeling good from ministry victory, because 
    he says we will be more &quot;blessed&quot; if we serve. (John 13:17) But 
    feeling pleasure is not the proper foundational motive for serving God. We 
    must learn to do it because God wills it, even if no one else does it, even 
    if we don't succeed at it, and even if it brings us pain and frustration. 
    (1 Cor. 4:2 note, &quot;trustworthy&quot; not &quot;successful&quot;) Failure 
    separates the quitters from the servants. Failure is a painful experience 
    that puts the question squarely: Am I going to continue doing something that 
    often brings me pain? God also uses other painful experiences to put this 
    question, such as betrayal by friends, suspicions, lack of appreciation, and 
    accusations from our people, but failure seems to be the supreme negative 
    experience. God wants to know whether we are prepared to serve in failure, 
    or only in success? (II Tim 4:3) Isaiah's call in Is. 6:8-13 basically promised 
    a ministry characterized by failure throughout. But Isaiah was willing and 
    faithful to that calling. God will test each minister on this point (often 
    though failure) to purify our motives.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="4">Leaders thus broken through failure become suitable tools in 
  the hands of the Lord. But unbroken leaders pose a threat to the health and 
  spirituality of the church. Leaders accustomed to nothing but success become, 
  themselves, hard to lead. They are always convinced they are right, and will 
  fight to preserve their base as though their self-worth depended on it, which 
  it often does. In their dread of failure, they may become downright unethical 
  and manipulative. They find it hard to listen to the wisdom of others because 
  they can't help but observe that their own ideas seem to be working perfectly 
  well. Such unbroken leaders not only fear failure in themselves, but also in 
  others. They may become unwilling to let others have the chance to fail, and 
  this leads to poor delegation in discipleship. When success becomes the be-all 
  and end-all in ministry, it is an idol that God must throw down. Note that failure 
  may come in an area other than our main ministry, but it will surely come.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Nothing would advance most of us more than getting some good 
  failure under our belts! It isn't that bad once you get used to it, and the 
  fruit over the long haul is well worth the pain. Consider how fear of failure 
  can affect the church:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="4">Home church leaders who suffer from excessive fear of failure 
    are reluctant to plant new churches. They know the mother church works, so 
    why take risks with an unproven plant? The result is tardy planting or no 
    planting, both of which retard the growth of the church and stifle the development 
    of young leaders.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">Young leaders are hardly ever as competent as older ones, 
    and history shows they are more likely to fail. But this observation begs 
    the question: Is such failure necessarily a bad thing? We argue that it need 
    not be bad, especially when our new leaders have been well-trained in their 
    view of failure. The experience of failure is always a crisis, since Satan 
    will move in and suggest God let them down, or that they are unworthy for 
    such work. But as discussed above, failure becomes the occasion for a new 
    questioning of motives and deepening of commitment if properly understood. 
    We should be actively preparing our disciples for failure as well as for success.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">Those who dread failure tend toward a conservatism that seeks 
    to protect the existing ministry rather than to open new ministry. When the 
    church becomes conservative and self-protective, it loses the offensive spirit 
    needed in spiritual war. We find ourselves unable to penetrate tough sectors 
    of the non Christian community.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="4">If you suffer from fear of failure, ask yourself, &quot;What 
  is the worst thing that can happen to me if I fail?&quot; Does failure in ministry 
  really endanger our lives, or only our egos? The ego-centered minister dreads 
  failure mainly because he will have to admit it to colleagues or others he hopes 
  to impress. Just imagining himself admitting defeat can send the ego-driven 
  leader into a panic of self-protection. But God calls us to deny self and serve 
  in ministry, not to glorify ourselves through it. Mentally practice shrugging 
  your shoulders before colleagues and saying, &quot;Yeah, that didn't work out, 
  but at least we tried&quot; and don't forget to add, &quot;I guess we'd better 
  try again!&quot; The only defense you need is, &quot;I felt like I did my best.&quot;</font></p>

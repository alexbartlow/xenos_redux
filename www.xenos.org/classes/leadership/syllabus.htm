<h2>Welcome to Christian Leadership class! </h2>
<p><b><font size="5">Assignments</font></b></p>
<p><font size="4">This is a notebook course. That means you will assemble a notebook
  as the course unfolds, and the quality of that notebook, along with your
  attendance and participation, will determine your grade for the course. The
  notebook will become a tool for your use as a Christian leader, so it is
  important that it be referenced and neat. There should be dividers by subject.
  The writing or typing should be neat and readable, and you should include
  your reading assignments, your class notes, any handouts, or other research.
  The notebook should become a resource you can turn to for ideas and direction
  in future years as you lead. We will examine the notebooks at the midway
  point in the class and provide you any feedback you need on your work to
  date. At the end of the class, the notebooks are due, and will be graded
  like a final exam. Be sure you keep up with the reading schedule, because
  you will need the reading to participate in class.</font></p>
<h2>Reading:</h2>
<p class="style1"><b>Read and assess Dennis McCallum and Jessica Lowery, <em>Organic Disciplemaking</em><i>,</i> according
  to schedule below. The assigned questions are answered and the answers are
  put into your notebook under assignments. They are not handed in until the
  notebook is handed in.</b> <strong>Even if this is your second time through the book, I believe this much material cannot be retained on one reading. You will probably find yourself getting more from the second reading than you did the first. For those who feel they are completely versed in Organic Disciplemaking, you may substitute Greg Ogden, Transforming Discipleship. </strong></p>

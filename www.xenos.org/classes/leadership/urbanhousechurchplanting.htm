            part of the </em></b><em><strong><a href="index.htm" target="_top">Introduction 
      to Christian Leadership</a> class offered to upcoming home group leaders 
      in Xenos]</strong></em></font></p>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Concept</font></h2>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Xenos sees itself as an underground indigenous house church-planting 
  movement.</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Underground</b> means
      that our growth is primarily through neighborhood groups, not through large
      worship services or seekers meetings.
    It also implies the leaders of home churches are all lay people (i.e. they
      are not professionals, but &quot;tentmakers&quot;). Even when staffers
      lead home groups, they receive no compensation for that part of their ministry.
      A church planting movement is a grassroots movement, not a staff-driven
    movement.</font></li>
  <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Indigenous</b>, means the leadership for the home churches 
    has to come from within the home churches themselves via a process of personal 
    discipleship. Xenos leaders would ask even experienced leaders from other 
    churches to spend time in a home church becoming one of the trusted leaders 
    in that group before sending them out with their own group.</font></li>
  <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>House Church-planting movement</b>, means the development 
    of such groups, if carried out properly, should lead to multiplication, or 
    exponential growth, unlike plans where a central office arranges groups from 
    lists of applicants and leaders. In a church planting movement, the impetus 
    for planting churches comes from within each group. Church planting also implies 
    that the groups are relatively self-sufficient for ministry, as opposed to 
    groups that are heavily dependent on program-heavy worship services or the 
    central leadership of the church. </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In addition to the self-replicating house churches, Xenos fields 
  a large central leadership and programs directed by paid staff. We also have 
  a main campus, or facility for headquarters. The reasons for the staff and programs 
  are:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The early church seems
      to have had unified elderships in each city, but multiple house churches.
      For instance, the church in Jerusalem
    had thousands attending, but they all related to the single eldership of
      the apostles, while also meeting &quot;from house to house.&quot; (Compare Acts 
    2:41; 42; 46) In Ephesus, the group must have numbered in the hundreds or 
    (more likely) the thousands, judging from the size of the pile of books and 
    charms they burned (Acts 19:19), yet they had a single eldership. (Acts 20:17) 
    These examples suggest the existence of both self-replicating house churches 
    and a central leadership group. We also see the early church's ability to 
    form special ministry teams or programs, like collections for the poor in 
    Judea or mission teams to go out to other cities. (Acts. 11:28-30, 13:1-3, 
    2&nbsp;Cor. 8,9) Specialized teams or programs are appropriate for specialized
    ministries. </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We think house churches can draw strength from each other 
    by banding together for these special cooperative, joint ministry projects 
    and programs. These could include:</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
    </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Large meetings</b> where home churches can come together 
        to share in the special gifting some strong teachers, preachers and evangelists 
        offer;</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Missions-sending</b> efforts which usually cost too 
        much for any home church to fund on it's own;</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Ministry to the poor</b>&#151;home
          churches are usually weak or completely ineffective at developing meaningful
          community development
        ministries;</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Ministries
            to children and students</b>&#151;home 
        churches tend to gravitate to a given age group and find it difficult
             to diversify into different age groups. Special thrusts to reach
            students 
        are usually more effective when program-based. Even groups that started
             as student groups tend to &quot;grow up&quot; and lose their connection
        to student ministry unless concerted efforts are made to stay young;</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Counseling and support ministries</b> that require 
        more expertise than most home churches can deliver;</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Sharing expertise in home church ministry</b>&#151;many
          home churches are very low on experience, so it makes sense to have
          some
        of the most experienced home church leaders available for consultation
          and advice. These usually have to be paid staff because the time demands
        of such availability would be too great for tent makers;</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Sharing Theological Expertise</b>&#151;Theologians
          and scholars follow a special calling that is impractical for most
          home
        church leaders. It makes sense to arrange for clusters of home churches
          to share access to theologically trained equippers who can take people's
          learning to the next level. By banding together, home churches can
          afford
        to have their own staff theologians and classes.</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Clearly, combining a
    cell-based and program-based approach seems promising, but contains dangers
    as well. Organizational theorists have
  noticed the program-based portion of the church tends to attract personnel
    and resources away from the church-planting movement. The eldership has to
    be vigilant
  for unnecessary programmatic growth while holding all programs to the same
    standard&#151;that 
  they are facilitating the church-planting movement, not restricting it. At
    Xenos, we agree the cell-based portion of the church must predominate over
    the program-based
  portion.</font></p>
<h2><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Elements of Successful Urban Home Church Planting at Xenos</b></font></h2>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A church planting movement will not just happen. Only if we 
  clearly mark our goal and strive toward it with careful planning, can we expect 
  God to deliver results. Some of the important elements of success in our opinion 
  are:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>C</b></font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font size="+1">ommitment
          to an ecclesiology  compatible with New Testament practice</font></b><font size="+1"> -
          Unless we believe strongly in the concept of body life as described
          in key New Testament
    passages like 1&nbsp;Corinthians 12 and 14, Eph. 4, 1 Peter 3, Col. 2:19
    and the book of Acts, we will never achieve such a movement. American churches,
    in particular, will likely follow successive spiritual fads that sweep the
    church in America every other year, resulting in an divergence of effort
    into
    unfruitful endeavors. In particular, we believe the church must move away
    from an emphasis on revivalism. Under revivalism, the key to spirituality
    is revival&#151;an
    event where the Spirit of God catches the church up in a spiritual experience
    of rejuvenation
    and catharsis that converts the lost, heals the 
    sick and delivers sinners. We believe revivals happen (and we have enjoyed
    them in our church), even though this is not a New Testament emphasis. New
    Testament Christians are
    never
    instructed
    
    how to bring about a revival. Further, the ideology that places revival as
     the key to success in the church can be destructive to the notion of a church
    
    planting movement. People may look to such supernatural events for a shortcut.
     This expectation drains energy from regular daily evangelism, living for
    God, 
    and disciple making, which seem mundane and unremarkable by comparison.
    Church multiplication takes daily effort, often exerted in very non-showy,
    quiet
    
    ways, such as building up fellow believers and engaging in friendship evangelism
     as a way of life. Consistency is essential. If a spiritual revival comes,
    
    we should accept it with joy. But waiting for the Spirit to &quot;fall&quot; often
    runs counter to the lifestyle needed for successful church planting, under
    our
    model.<br>
          </font></font></li>
  <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>A commitment to the concept and practice of personal 
    discipleship</b> - A house church is not based on any amazing music groups 
    or drama acts. At the center of each fruitful home church is a group of sincere, 
    spiritually-minded, loving people. It is our leaders and workers who draw 
    people into a home church. Likewise, to plant another home church, nothing 
    will do but the duplication of a similar group of leaders and workers for 
    the new group. Home church planting doesn't depend on any secret structural 
    or programmatic approaches. It depends on discipleship. This process of moving 
    individuals from unbelief, self-centeredness, sin-dependency and ignorance 
    to a place of spiritual maturity takes years of patient investment, training, 
    friendship and sacrifice. Recent studies of American Christianity have demonstrated 
    the church in America talks about personal discipleship, but does not practice 
    it (See George Barna, <i>Growing Effective Disciples</i>). In healthy home 
    churches most of the members should either be trying to disciple others or 
    be under discipleship by others. We need clear <a href="discipleship.html">goals 
    for discipleship</a>. We should also avoid <a href="leadershipandauth.html">any 
    conception of discipleship</a> that implies control or authoritarian theories.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>A team approach</b> -
      At Xenos, home churches are usually led by teams, not individuals. Likewise,
      the average home church has a &quot;second 
    line&quot; of workers. These are relatively well-trained and motivated members
    who back up the leaders and are themselves in preparation for leading their
    own home church. When planting a new home church then, we have to look at
    the group as a team made up of four to six leaders and another four to eight
    second-line workers. Under a team theory, the team is greater than the sum
    of its parts. In other words, we need to look at how a group works together,
    and the balance of different gifting, personalities, maturity levels and
    ministry
    development. If we know of specific weaknesses in key leaders, these might
    be offset by strengths in others on their team. Part of the process of planting
    a home church is to work with members of the new team to help them understand
    their individual contributions to the team. Young Christians who doubt themselves
    when it comes to leading a group by themselves, may feel a good level of
    confidence
    about their contribution to a team. This approach also suggests we should
    try to define the outline of the new team as soon as possible after the previous
    church plant. While we see team leadership as preferable, especially for
    larger groups, we do not feel this should be a precondition for planting
    new house churches. Many groups may plant without team leadership and build
    a team up later.<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>A commitment to
        organic church growth</b>.
      We believe God grows his church as he wills, and we are to be &quot;coworkers
      with God&quot; 
    (1&nbsp;Cor. 3:9) seeking to cooperate with what he is doing. If we believe
     the Spirit needs to lead the church, one implication is that God brings
    about 
    relationships and ministries that tend to order the church a certain way.
     (1&nbsp;Cor. 12:18 &quot;He has placed the members in the body just as he
      wills.&quot;) Based on this notion, leaders of an existing home church
      will  look for ways to plant a new home church naturally, not artificially.
      By natural, 
    we mean they will seek to keep young Christians together with those to whom
       they minister and with whom they have invested relationally. An artificial
      
    plant would be one in which leaders are established by seniority over people
       they did not win or disciple, and with whom they do not have established
      relationships. 
    (This is a problem with centrally organized small group systems that create
       entire groups through a bureau or geographically. Referring people to
      existing 
    groups would be a different proposition). If our younger Christian workers
       see themselves building a team that will eventually go out with them to
      lead 
    a home church, we can anticipate a high level of motivation. If we shuffle
       people around too much, we can expect people to feel &quot;jerked around&quot; and
    disgruntled. Planting a new church will not be viewed as a victorious event
    beginning a new adventure, but as the occasion of loss and heartache. To
    avoid
    this, groups need to <a href="hcmang.html">plan well in advance</a>, watching
     what God is doing and reacting accordingly.<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>A strong prayer
        ministry</b> - At Xenos, we have seen 
    that successful church planting is associated with dedication to prayer.
        Our  best church planting teams have regular times of prayer together
        for the mission 
    of the church. A good prayer meeting should be based on a prayer list prepared
         in advance by one of the members. Praying for non-Christian friends
        by name 
    as well as key goals in the home church will help turn back the attacks of
        the evil one and unleash the power of God into the church.<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>A mission-oriented self-concept</b> - We are familiar 
    with cases in other churches as well as in Xenos where a home church reached 
    the point where they were full and needed to plant a new group, only to have 
    the members and even the leaders refuse. The refusal to plant a new church 
    was usually based mainly on the fact that members didn't want to upset a situation 
    they saw as very happy and wholesome. In our view, such groups are far from 
    wholesome. They are desperately sick! The members have come to see the home 
    church as something that exists for their well-being and happiness, not for 
    accomplishing the will of God. A well-led home church sees itself as a team 
    setting out to accomplish a mission, even at the expense of acute personal 
    suffering. If the planting ethic or an outward, missional focus is taught 
    and modeled from the beginning of a home church, people come to the time of 
    church planting with excitement and joy that their mission has been successful. 
    This joy may possibly be combined with tears about the friendships that will 
    undergo change in the future, but never to the point where members would even 
    consider not going forward. Members in a successful church-planting movement 
    see themselves as participants in a vast, spiritual war. Both concern for 
    the lost and excitement over the fact that we are going to win drive them 
    forward to a position of self-sacrificial love.<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>A willingness to fail</b> - Church planting should be 
    done carefully and every group planted should have good prospects for success, 
    based on the best estimates of the leadership of that group and the central 
    leadership of the church. However, approaches that seek to <a href="failure.htm">eliminate 
    the possibility of failure</a> become so conservative and cautious they cannot
    generate the excitement and motivation needed to drive a movement. God wants
    those to serve him who are willing either to fail or succeed and be faithful
    in either case. (1&nbsp;Cor. 4:2) Only leaders and workers who are egocentric
    will refuse to risk the perils of failure in ministry. At the same time,
    the
    church's leadership needs to develop a program for failed groups that will
    recover as many people as possible and nurture them back to readiness to
    try
    again.<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Centralized support
        for equipping</b> - While not really 
    necessary, it makes sense for the larger church to band together and form
         a program to assist home churches in equipping their people. This kind
        of 
    program usually includes classes taught by leaders with some kind of expertise.
         Although home churches could equip their own people, a central program
        will 
    speed up the process and relieve home group leaders from part of their burden.
         We do not believe such a program will work apart from personal discipleship
        
    in the home church. At Xenos, our <a href="../index.htm">class system</a> 
    adds an outside source of knowledge to the 
    leadership training program in the home church. <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>An actual plan for planting</b> - If everything else 
    is in place and a home church is growing to capacity, leaders need to decide 
    how they will plant. There are several possibilities here, and <a href="planting.html">material 
    has been written</a> on how to decide the planting method.</font></li>
</ol>
<h2><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Constraints on Church Planting</font></h2>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">While the notion of church multiplication is common in contemporary 
  ecclesiological and missiological theory, successful examples of church planting 
  movements are hard to document, especially in the U.S. Why is such a promising 
  and biblical concept so often unsuccessful? There are probably many answers 
  to this question, but in our view, most failures fall into the a few basic categories: 
  </font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Superficiality</b> - American church leaders tend to 
    interpret the biblical picture of church planting in very superficial and 
    non-demanding ways. Leadership in a home church is seen as something that 
    must not significantly interfere with typical bourgeois American middle-class 
    living. American culture already places heavy time demands on the modern family 
    that may interfere with an adequate family life. Most American families are 
    convinced they have to: </font> 
    <ul>
      <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">work long hours;</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> be available for any travel demands their careers may 
        dictate;</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> belong to sports leagues;</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> keep their houses and yards immaculate;</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> clean and care for their late-model cars;</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> shop for the latest styles;</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">maintain their hobbies;</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> keep up with several weekly TV serials;</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">take their kids to every sports league and activity 
        available at school;</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> If we add attendance at one or two church meetings per 
      week, who has time to do any more?<br>
      <br>
      When we compare American living to the early church, we see a striking
      contrast. In the early church they were &quot;day by day&quot; having meals together 
      and meeting from house to house. (Acts 2:46) This expression suggests Christian 
      community took up a very large part of people's lives. Deep community like 
      that described in the New Testament requires significant time investment 
      into relationships. We can't drive up to the McDonald's window and demand 
      community be handed through the window! How can the &quot;one another&quot; passages
      in the New Testament be viewed as realistic apart from heavy time investment?
      Likewise, the training needed to become competent as Christian
      leaders takes a great deal of time investment. Becoming a man or woman
      of God ready to lead a flock for him will certainly interfere in a massive
      way with materialistic and entertainment pursuits that so dominate the
      schedules
      of adult Americans today. Like the rich young ruler, many American church
      members must turn away in sadness at the New Testament picture of radical
      Christian living.<br>
      <br>
      The result of the divergence between the radical commitment of the New
      Testament church and today's convenient approach, where only our leftover
      minutes
      are devoted to spiritual growth and community is superficiality. Church
      leaders try to patch together some form of community outwardly like that
      in the New Testament, but without the devotion and investment assumed in
      the New Testament. They feel they don't dare call on their people for their
      time (or, they realize whether they call on them for time doesn't matter,
      because they aren't going to get it anyway). But simply introducing a structure
      involving home groups to a church is not going to produce New Testament-style
      fellowship, let alone a church-planting movement. Although such groups
      may
      superficially resemble New Testament house churches, the heart of the matter
      is missing&#151;men and women of God sold out to each other and the non-Christian
      world in the love of Christ!<br>
      <br>
      Superficial groups may substitute artificial exercises for real relational 
      closeness. Members may be called on to share something embarrassing, or 
      huddle in prayer while revealing a key need in their lives. People who aren't 
      really close at all, try to act like they are close. Likewise, superficial 
      groups may substitute a scripted approach to ministry for real ministry. 
      Leaders are told what to say and do during a meeting and during personal 
      encounters because they don't understand the Bible or other people well 
      enough to respond to situations creatively and spontaneously. People who 
      are seeing each other in a personal setting for the only time that week, 
      or even the only time in two weeks cannot be expected to know each other's 
      needs or how to meet those needs. The demands of personal discipleship virtually 
      always are too high for today's superficial approaches to home group ministry 
      (unless personal discipleship is also redefined in superficial terms). But 
      without effective, deep discipleship we see little prospect of multiplication, 
      either of disciples or of home churches.<br>

  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font size="+1">Impatience</font></b><font size="+1"> -
        We believe the  American church is enamored with spiritual shortcuts.
        For instance, we want 
    shortcuts to spiritual health and deliverance from sin through a variety
        of  pathways involving miracles or esoteric insights. Plodding, steady
        spiritual 
    growth seems too unmiraculous for quick-fix Americans. Likewise, when it
        comes  to evangelism and church growth, Americans are fascinated by approaches
        that 
    provide quick growth. Our media resounds with stories about churches that
         went from nothing to thousands in a few years or even a few months.
        And we 
    admit God does work this way in supernatural revival, and he has worked that
         way at Xenos during certain periods. But is explosive growth in a short
        time really the norm for 
    Christian ministry? Is this something we should seek or desire? We think
         building quality and depth in a self-replicating, church-planting
        
    movement is more important. Such quality will eventually result in big numbers
        of people being reached, in fact bigger numbers than revivalism by itself
        can ever hope to
        achieve.
        But
        leaders
        
    and members have to take the long view if they are to successfully pursue
         a house-church planting strategy.<br>
    <br>
    Many impatient churches aren't even willing to pursue home fellowship in
    any  meaningful way, but focus almost exclusively on public shows or musical
    programs 
    that promise more rapid growth. Such groups are unwilling to invest in any
     pursuit that takes manpower or resources away from the worship services. We
     believe most of the growth gained in this way is pseudo-growth. The fancy
     services are attracting believers away from other believing churches.<br>
    <br>
    In the field of home groups, the Yonngi Cho experience in Korea may have
    caused problems here for the American church. Cho's formula involves doubling
    and
    planting small groups every six months. This model is so aggressive it could
    begin with one six-person small group, and win every adult on earth in 13
    years! We think that's a bit impatient, and it should also be clear that
    something
    isn't working in the model. We fear the peril of planting such rapidly reproducing
    groups is unavoidable shallowness in practice. &quot;Ministry&quot; becomes 
    oversimplified to mean nothing more than praying God will &quot;fix&quot; 
    or heal those with complicated problems. Our reading of the Bible suggests 
    to the contrary, people have to grow out of their problems through a gradual 
    process including struggle, learning, slow growth&#151;and prayer, too. In
    extreme cases, members of groups with oversimplified ministry models may
    even
    pretend to be changed and keep their hurts or sins secret in the future.<br>
    <br>
    Our own ministry has suffered in the past as a result of impatience. Overheating
     the growth of the church can have catastrophic results as groups are duplicated
    
    in numbers, but steadily decline in depth, quality and maturity. Eventually
     people begin to lose confidence in the whole project because they sense
    their 
    lives are as messed up as ever and that their relationships are shallow and
     transitory. An overheated, impatient church planting ministry may eventually
    
    become unstable, like a house of cards in danger of complete collapse. In
     the ensuing chaos, the leadership of the church may turn away from house-church
    
    planting completely, the membership may become very demoralized, or a division
     of the church could result.<br>
    <br>
    One thing that always suffers in an impatient atmosphere is personal discipleship.
     Experience suggests most new Christians need to undergo a process of discipleship
    
    lasting some years if their characters are to mature enough to lead successfully
    in the long haul. Some of this training can go on after a person has already
    become a leader. But impatient leaders can't
    stand the
    long
    haul
    implied
    in a disciple making
    
    approach.<br>
    <br>
    Learning also suffers in impatient churches. Justified theologically, the
    ignorance of members is excused and even glorified over against &quot;bookworms&quot; 
    and &quot;ivory-tower&quot; theologians who are &quot;do-nothings.&quot; While
    we recognize these dangers, we also believe that  under this
    super-spiritual approach, New Testament admonitions to &quot;study
      to show yourself a workman approved by God, having no need to be ashamed,
     
    and handling accurately the word of truth&quot; become nonsensical. Neither
     are we able to &quot;preach the word,&quot; as Paul urges Timothy (2 Tim.
    2:15; 4:2) unless we do the study. Impatient churches usually shortcut to
     formulaic teaching that holds no one's interest or highly subjective &quot;the
     Lord is telling me&quot; teaching that cannot offer the answers we need
     to cope
     with
    the falsehood of the world system. The result of an ignorance-based, church-planting
    approach is a steady reduction of quality in churches planted. Such weak
    and
    confused churches tend to collapse over time.<br>

  <li><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Inward Focus</b> - We have talked with quite a few churches 
    who started a home group ministry, only to see the groups turn inward and 
    lose evangelistic effectiveness. Such groups are mainly interested in blessing 
    each other and have lost the excitement of evangelism. This pathology is desperate 
    because it is extremely hard to turn around. If anything, we believe that 
    groups who turn inward are in even worse shape than impatient or superficial 
    groups.<br>

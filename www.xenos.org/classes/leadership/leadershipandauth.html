<h2><font size="+1">A unified statement of policy from the leaders at Xenos'
    College Ministry </font></h2>
<p><font size="+1">9/20/97</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">During recent discussions with members and each other, we
    have discovered confusion and possible misinterpretation of our position
    on leadership and authority boundaries. To avoid further confusion and to
    bring glory to God, we have consulted the elders and come together in a combined
    leaders' meeting to compose our thoughts on this key subject. The elders
    have reviewed the paper, and have affirmed these findings as accurately reflecting
    Xenos policy. This paper can be freely disseminated as members see fit. </font></p>
<h3><font color="#FFCC00" size="+1">What is Leadership Authority?</font></h3>
<p><font size="+1">Although the heart of leadership according to Scripture is
    servanthood (Mark 10:42-45), the Bible also teaches that legitimate leaders
    have authority, in the sense of a right to direct others. This authority
    comes from God and is delegated to leaders for the good of the church. The
    following verses reflect the clear teaching that leaders should be respected
    and obeyed when operating within their legitimate sphere of authority: </font>
<dl>
  <dt><font size="+1">1 Cor. 16:15-18 </font></dt>
  <dd><font size="+1">You know that the household of Stephanas were the first
      converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of
      the saints. I urge you, brothers, to submit to such as these and to everyone
      who joins in the work, and labors at it. . . Such men deserve recognition. </font></dd>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><font size="+1">1 Thes. 5:12,13 </font></dt>
  <dd><font size="+1">Now we ask you, brothers, to respect those who work hard
      among you, who are over you in the Lord and who admonish you. Hold them
      in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with
      each other.</font></dd>
  <dt>&nbsp; </dt>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><font size="+1">Titus 2:15 </font></dt>
  <dd><font size="+1">[Speaking to a leader] These, then, are the things you
      should teach. Encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone
      despise you. </font></dd>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><font size="+1">Heb. 13:7 </font></dt>
  <dd><font size="+1">Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you.
      Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith. </font></dd>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><font size="+1">Heb. 13:17 </font></dt>
  <dd><font size="+1">Obey your leaders and submit to their authority. They keep
      watch over you as those who must give an account. Obey them so that their
      work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no advantage to
      you. </font></dd>
</dl>
<p><font size="+1">Of course the Bible's teaching on obedience does not mean
    the church can outlaw dissent<a name="dissent"></a> when expressed legitimately.
    When members conscientiously disagree with a direction advanced by leaders,
    they have the right to express dissent. This dissent should be expressed
    in a way that safeguards the unity of the church, is respectful, not bitter,
    and in love. Xenos elders have declared that we will respect a right to dissent
    in our church as long as it is expressed maturely. The paper, <a href="../../essays/vision09.htm">&quot;A
    Vision for Christian Servanthood&quot;</a> details steps members can take
    to assure their dissent is effective and constructive. Any effort taken by
    leaders to harm the reputation or exclude legitimate dissenters from the
    life of the church would clearly be wrong. Leaders must be mature enough
    to accept the fact that others may disagree on judgment calls, even within
    their own church, without reacting in hurt or becoming insecure.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Dissent is different than rebellion. Rebellion involves attempting
    to set people in the church against the leadership. This is also division
    and schism, which are sinful and subject to admonition and even formal discipline.
    The elders have written a paper on our rules for church discipline, called <a href="appdis.html">&quot;Rules
    for Church Discipline&quot;</a>.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In addition to these points, we would remind people of key
    qualifications from another of the earlier elders' papers on <a href="authority.html">authority
    in the church</a>:</font></p>
<h3><b><font size="4">1. Leadership Accountability</font></b></h3>
<ol>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>&quot;There is no such thing as autonomous delegated
        authority.</i> All delegated authorities are under God's authority. This
        is why, when scripture addresses those under delegated authority, it
        also addresses those in delegated authority in the same passage and reminds
        them of their responsibilities before God.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
  <p><font size="+1">We take this qualification to mean that, just as members
      are accountable to leaders when it comes to home church ministry, leaders
      are accountable to the elders or &quot;overseers&quot; (1&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;3;
      Tit.&nbsp;1) of the church and to each other. This accountability includes
      demonstrating to their colleagues that they conduct their ministry in accordance
      with ministry standards established by the eldership and the Servant Team.
      When Xenos leaders are out of line, members can contact the office to complain
      to the grievance board, to the relevant sphere leader, or to the elders.
      They will launch an investigation of leadership errors or misbehavior and
      give members full opportunity to be heard.</font></p>
</ol>
<h3><b><font size="4">2. Leadership Limitations</font></b></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>&quot;The scope of the authority is limited to the area
        of the authority given to them by God.</i> God does not require us to
        obey leaders outside the legitimate sphere of their authority. This is
        why wives are urged to &quot;be submissive to your <i>own</i> husbands&quot; -
        not to all men (1 Pet. 3:1; Eph. 5:22). For the same reason, it is inappropriate
        for parents to tell their adult children whom they must marry, or for
        civil authorities to tell their citizens what religious beliefs they
        must hold, or for church authorities to tell Christians what jobs they
        may take.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">In connection with point #2, we remember that Xenos has
      been troubled at times in its past by leaders and members assuming that
      church leaders have authority in areas where they do not. As a result of
      such misunderstanding, members or leaders have at times tended to make
      leaders into surrogate parents who regulate areas of life completely unrelated
      to church ministry. In the Bible, the church is sometimes called the family
      of God, but we should remember that the parent is God the father--leaders
      are brothers and sisters like the rest.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">We notice two exceptions: 1)Paul compares himself to a mother
      nursing and a father to the Thessalonians (1 Thess. 2:7, 11). However,
      the similarity with mothers is the affection they have for their children,
      and the similarity to fathers was in the way they were &quot;exhorting
      and encouraging and imploring&quot; the Thessalonians. These actions suggest
      pleas, not commands. 2) He calls himself the Corinthians' father (1 Cor.
      4:15) and implies that this gives him a measure of authority, but this
      applies only to those who were actually converted through his ministry.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">As an example, we know of cases where members have asked
      leaders to &quot;hold them accountable&quot; for their spending. Home church
      leaders agreed, and began going over the member's checkbook each month
      checking whether they were living up to a budget. Later, when the member
      came to resent the leader's oversight of this area, they left the church
      and reported to a cult watch group that Xenos leaders went over their checkbook
      each month, including assigning them how much to give to the church! Of
      course, the member failed to mention that he had requested this assistance,
      resulting in an embarrassing and misleading picture of Xenos leaders. However,
      we also believe the incident never should have happened. When the cult
      watch group later leveled the charge that Xenos leaders oversee budgets
      including giving commitments, the elders looked into it and found that
      they were unable to deny the charge, much to our embarrassment. In this
      case, leaders had allowed themselves to be drawn into inappropriate authority.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Similar problems have arisen in the past, often from well-intentioned
      efforts to help members in areas such as dating and marriage, sex counseling,
      career counseling, relationship counseling, and social practices, such
      as whether to go to certain bars, to attend certain concerts, or to watch
      certain movies. Leaders should have declined to accept such parent-like
      roles, even if asked, and instead insisted that members learn to think
      through these issues for themselves. The elders have addressed the problem
      repeatedly at workers' meetings and servant team meetings over the past
      15 years, but not recently. Their message has been that leaders need to
      exercise care to avoid implying that their authority extends further than
      it really does, or letting members press them into using authority in areas
      that are not legitimate.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Members may be accountable to each other in a more general
      sense. For instance, I may ask my friend, &quot;How is it coming with your
      eating problem.&quot; But I would refuse to monitor his daily menu. Another
      example would be cases where a brother has asked a friend to install software
      on his computer that blocks internet porno, and to keep the password secret.
      This seems legitimate, because the helper is not actually monitoring or
      supervising the other's browsing. The key is to consider what sort of accounting
      would be parent-like, or more appropriate for children than adults.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">We are zealous to avoid illegitimate expansion of leadership
      authority, not only because of our reputation as a church, but also because
      of the negative effect such expansion has on our members. Members who wrongly
      depend on leaders to &quot;hold them accountable&quot; or make decisions
      for them never learn the self-discipline and mature decision making that
      should characterize good disciples of Jesus Christ. Leaders should be eager
      to foster independence and internal moral control in their members, avoiding
      dependency.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">To understand the appropriate scope of authority for any
      given office we can examine the question of responsibility. If an authority
      figure is responsible for some area, then it is reasonable to assume that
      he or she should have the authority to carry out that responsibility. If,
      however, someone else is primarily responsible for the outcome of a given
      decision, church leaders would be out of line for suggesting that they
      should make the decision.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">For instance, who is responsible for the way you raise your
      children? Clearly, parents alone bear this responsibility. Therefore, while
      church leaders can teach parenting principles, and can offer advice to
      parents, they would never accept decision-making authority, even if parents
      asked them to.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">This principle would also apply in many other areas, such
      as dating, finance, diet, media, etc. We believe church leaders are assigned
      authority almost exclusively in the relatively narrow sphere of running
      the ministry of the church. While leaders have a pastoral role in members'
      lives, this is accomplished by persuasion, not by command authority. A
      number of examples of legitimate and illegitimate areas of authority may
      help us understand this principle. </font></p>

<h3><font size="+1">Sample Legitimate Uses of Home Church Leaders' Authority</font></h3>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li><font size="+1">Deciding how a home church will use or not use music
        in its meetings. </font></li>
    <li><font size="+1">Deciding on membership of cell groups or other study
        groups focusing on discipleship. (But not regulating who attends public
        meetings like home churches. Note that campus ministry home churches
        are technically &quot;<a href="../../admin/minteam.htm">Ministry Teams</a>&quot; in
        Xenos, which means they do have the right to restrict attendance at their
        meetings.) </font></li>
    <li><font size="+1">Deciding who is admitted to ministry houses. (However,
        terms for admission and removal from houses should be disclosed to prospective
        members <i>before</i> they move in) </font></li>
    <li><font size="+1">Deciding who will teach at meetings, and what will be
        taught. </font></li>
    <li><font size="+1">Deciding what ministries will be prioritized at meetings
        (with announcements, for instance), but not preventing people from practicing
        ministries they feel led to practice. </font></li>
    <li><font size="+1">Deciding when and how to apply formal church discipline.
        (The elders require an opportunity to review and possibly veto any proposed
        formal discipline involving removal from the church) </font></li>
    <li><font size="+1">Deciding what standards will apply in judgment areas
        of ministry, such as how strict or lenient to be on gray matters, or
        how certain problems should be counseled. For instance, how soon after
    a serious moral failure should a personal be allowed to teach? </font></li>
    <li><font size="+1">Mapping out a doctrinal position on areas open to question,
        such as the role of women in the church or social or divorce ethics (but
        not forbidding members to hold different views in these non-essential
        areas). </font></li>
    <li><font size="+1">Recognizing ministry house leaders, cell leaders, high school leaders (but get sphere approval for change in Sr. leaders), or sit-in leaders. </font></li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1">Even from this partial list we see that church leaders have
    substantial authority to carry out their ministry. The prerogatives mentioned
    in this list would easily enable leaders to establish what emphases the church
    will feature, which ultimately determines the tone and feel of a church.
    They are truly authoritative leaders of the church's ministry.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Also remember that in Xenos, the elders have reserved certain
    decisions exclusively to themselves. These are not delegated to home group
    or ministry team leaders. They include: </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li><font size="+1">Setting certain budget parameters for the church and
        authorizing new spending </font></li>
    <li><font size="+1">Removal of deacons or elders from office </font></li>
    <li><font size="+1">Removal of staff workers at, or above the level of department
        heads </font></li>
    <li><font size="+1">Ordaining new deacons and commissioning new ministries </font></li>
    <li><font size="+1">Approving brochures and literature that speak for Xenos </font></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<h3><font size="+1">Sample Areas Where Church Authority Often Becomes Illegitimate</font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <h4><font size="+1">Bible studies or other public ministries started by members
      outside the established schedule. </font></h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">Leaders should be very reluctant to oppose new ministries
        that are within biblical norms (such as Bible studies, evangelistic outreaches,
        or fellowship groups). Our history is full of examples where individuals
        began ministries on the side, and those ministries have grown into important
        features of the church today. <br>
          <br>
      There may be exceptions to this rule of thumb, where, for instance, the
      one starting the group has been discredited by recent, objective immoral
      behavior or false teaching to the degree they may not teach. Another case
      would be ministries that may cause damage to our reputation. But in general,
      we want Xenos to be a place where individual ministry initiative is allowed
      and encouraged, not restricted. Note that Xenos <em>accredits</em> ministries,
      which is completely different than <em>giving permission</em> for workers
      to pursue ministries. Accreditation is merely a decision to prioritize
      a ministry, not to permit it. Usually ministries are accredited after already
      existing for a period of time. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <h4><font size="+1">Dating and romance. </font></h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">Christians are often harmed by wrongful dating practices,
        and leaders are painfully aware of the dangers in this area. Sexual predators
        pose a danger to any group of single Christians. However, leaders may
        be tempted to block this damage through illegitimate use of church authority.
        Scripture draws a clear line at sexual misbehavior (1&nbsp;Cor.5:11)
        and at marrying non Christians (2&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;6:14). In the event
        that either of these happen or are likely to happen, leaders have a clear
        basis to intervene with strong admonition and even some types of church
        discipline. <br>
          <br>
      Other cases may be more borderline, such as older Christians deciding to
      seriously date brand new Christians, perhaps only days old in the Lord.
      These often reflect foolishness, and may call for advice and appeals for
      wisdom. However, any two walking Christians ultimately have the freedom
      to date if they want to. <br>
          <br>
      Even more subjective would be cases where leaders sense that one or both
      involved in dating are not mature enough or relationally advanced enough
      to succeed in long-term dating and marriage. While leaders may believe
      they can tell, especially in extreme cases, that certain couples face major
      problems and possibly failure in marriage, the fact is, no one can know
      for certain what the future holds. We know of examples where even our most
      experienced leaders have erred in their predictions, both claiming marriages
      would fail when they actually succeeded, and claiming they would succeed
      when they failed. Besides the subjectivity involved, it should also be
      clear that the members bear the responsibility for their own marriages,
      not leaders. For both these reasons, leaders have to restrain themselves
      to offering personal opinion, <i>and carefully delineating between their
      opinion and their authority as leaders</i>. <br>
          <br>
      This should include three distinct elements that should be shared along
      with any personal advice to dating couples: 1) that the view is only a
      matter of personal opinion, and could be wrong 2) that the decision belongs
      to the dating members, not to the leaders and 3) that they will be supported
      regardless of how they chose to proceed. <br>
            <br>
      Other cases are so subjective they don't merit even advice from leaders.
      These would include cases where leaders think the personality mixes might
      be bad, or where personal tastes regarding looks or life occupations differ.
      For leaders to offer opinions in such cases constitutes a wrongful intrusion
      and tends to discredit leaders' advice by bringing it down to a level where
      they couldn't possibly know what they are talking about. Raising questions
      in these areas to stimulate members to think carefully may be legitimate,
      but again, these should be carefully delineated from any sense of urging
      or appeal. </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Neither we nor Xenos elders want anything to do with telling
        or pressuring members not to date except in cases involving objective <i>recent</i> sexual
        misbehavior or unequal yoking with non Christians. Opposing marriage
        plans between walking Christians is also usually out of line. An exception
        is the right to decline to officiate at a marriage that bothers the conscience
        of a given leader. While leaders should not lightly refuse to marry members,
        we cannot ask them to actively facilitate a union they are uncomfortable
        with. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <h4><font size="+1">Discipleship </font></h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">Discipleship means teaching or training. In the 80's a
        movement grew up in the U.S. known as the &quot;Shepherding Movement.&quot; Leaders
        of this movement argued that people need a discipler to give them orders
        (even in non-moral areas, like what car to buy) so they could learn to
        obey. The argument was that by learning to obey an earthly discipler
        they would learn to obey God, and meanwhile, the discipler could fix
        them up with good imperatives. This movement has become a catastrophe
        in the eyes of virtually all churches today. It was completely discredited
        because either disciplers damaged others' lives but were unable to take
        responsibility for their actions, or they ended up giving bizarre and
        unwarranted imperatives. The damage done to evangelicals' reputations
        was pointless, because this is not how people learn to follow God. <br>
            <br>
      At Xenos Fellowship <b>we want nothing to do with this understanding of
      discipleship</b>. Biblical discipleship is a role involving <em>facilitating</em> others'
      growth through sharing knowledge and experience, and living as models.
      It is not a role involving <em>controlling</em> others in any way. Actions
      taken under pressure from a discipler are of doubtful value in any case.
      We believe in sharing our point of view and the reasons for our opinions,
      and letting others do as they decide in non-moral areas.<br>
            <br>
      Another area where leaders should observe restraint is respecting the Holy
      Spirit's ordering of discipleship ministry and personal friendships. When
      a member brings a friend to Christ and begins discipling that person, we
      believe leaders should not interfere unless the one discipling is morally
      disqualified because of recent, serious, and objective sin. As leaders,
      our mission is to raise up those who can disciple others. Therefore, it
      makes no sense to interfere with natural discipleship relationships that
      could lead to future ministry spheres. An obvious exception to this rule
      of thumb would be cases of male-female or female-male discipleship. Such
      relationships are inadvisable except when involving seniors, as shown over
      and over again historically. Another case calling for intervention would
      be when a member's efforts to initiate discipleship are interferring with
      already established discipleship by another member.<br>
            <br>
      On the other side, leaders (or anyone else) are free to come alongside
      and also invest in a new person. No one &quot;owns&quot; a disciple in
      an exclusive sense. But this should be done to assist or help the younger
      discipler, not to replace him or her. Likewise, we recognize that leaders
      should respect the relationships people build with one another, such as
      those in cell groups. It would be arbitrary and harmful to call on people
      to constantly change groups and lose the continuity of their friendships.
      While leaving friends is inevitable if we are to plant new groups, this
      should only be done when necessary to plant new groups or for some other
      compelling and unusual reason. </font></p>

  <h4><font size="+1">Hobbies, Sports, and Time Management </font></h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">How Christians order their time priorities is a matter
        of some importance in determining how rapidly they grow. We would love
        to see all Christians give high priority to Body life, evangelism, self-equipping,
        and relational investment. However, the amount of time to devote to these
        things is a judgment call that must be made by members, not by leaders.
        Leaders find themselves in a very sensitive position when they try to
        explain that failure to prioritize relational investment or time in fellowship
        could impact a member's growth. We have to explain the relationship between
        commitment and growth without appearing to issue a demand. As leaders
        we have to learn to respect different freedoms used by Christians, realizing
        that not all Christians grow at the same rate or intensity. Scripture
        does not tell us whether we should spend nights playing softball missing
        certain meetings, so we should not invent new absolutes in these areas.
        We believe leaders should not be intrusive by calling on members to order
        their schedule a certain way.<br>
            <br>
      We note two important exceptions to this principle. 1) Ministry houses
      often require attendance at certain meetings as house rules. This is not
      wrong, as long as the house leadership make their rules clear to members <i>before </i>the
      move in. 2) Leaders are accountable for a certain level of participation
      in meetings and other activities as part of their freely accepted burden
      as leaders. Leaders are more accountable than others, as seen in the requirements
      for deacons and elders. These requirements are specific to leadership offices,
      and should never be imposed on members in general. Neither should leadership
      requirements be imposed on members. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <h4><font size="+1">Choosing Friends.</font> </h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">Which friends a Christian chooses to spend time with can
        affect their spiritual growth. Scripture warns that &quot;Bad company
        corrupts good character.&quot; (1Cor. 15:33) However, this general maxim
        is not an absolute, and must vary greatly in application. We believe
        it is up to individuals to decide whether spending time with certain
        friends is harmful to their walks. Leaders can point out obvious problems
        arising in certain relationships, but it is up to the individual to pick
        his or her own friends. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <h4><font size="+1">Personal Spending. </font></h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">Some Christians get into trouble through bad spending
        decisions, and leaders may be tempted to try helping them through guiding
        their spending. This would be a mistake. While we must feel free to teach
        biblical principles of financial stewardship, or to raise questions about
        extremely questionable big-ticket spending, these decisions belong to
        the individual member. One exception might be where members are in such
        debt or default that they are bringing disgrace on the name of Christ,
        or are defrauding fellow Christians. At this point, stealing or defrauding
        becomes a moral issue.</font></p>
  </blockquote>

<p><font size="+1">The Xenos College ministry is an exciting, outreaching, growing
    group of students and leaders. We thank God that we have such a motivated
    and energized group. We are not calling in this paper for a shift that would
    make us a soft group. We want full involvement. We want zeal. We want commitment.
    These are the least we should offer the Lord. By making sure we all have
    a proper understanding of church leadership and authority, we believe we
    will sustain our zeal and commitment without stain of wrong-doing or over-doing.
    While we may see some take advantage of the grace of God, in the long run
    we will see deeper and more lasting results if we all accept only that authority
    we should have in our position, and refuse any more.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In Mark 10, Jesus warns about &quot;the spirit of the Gentiles&quot; who
    love to lord it over one another. John also rebuked &quot;Diotrephes, who
    loves to be first among them.&quot; (3 John) We are thankful we have the
    kind of leadership that will take positive measures to prevent these problems
    in our church. Our leaders are our most important assets and we are glad
    we have good ones.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We hope the whole church can come together around these principles,
    and that we will have a clearer understanding than before.</font></p>

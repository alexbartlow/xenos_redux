<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">Christian leadership involves influencing 
    others. We want to be able to influence people to do God's will, much of which 
    requires a certain level of expertise in order to be effective (witnessing, 
    teaching, discipling, etc.). This means that in the first place, the leader 
    is concerned with the learning process, and how to bring about rapid and permanent 
    learning.</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">Also, when psychologists refer to learning, 
    they mean not only learning facts about a subject, but learning behaviors. 
    A child must learn to walk, talk, and feed herself. Christians must learn 
    to pray, study, love others, admit sin etc. The leader not only must demonstrate 
    and explain how these and other things are done, she must also cause the learner 
    to desire to do such things. Learning has occurred when the learner exhibits 
    the learned behavior regularly and without prompting from others. </font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">Erickson reports that an amazing 94% of 
    college teachers studied in one scientific survey rate themselves above average 
    as teachers. Yet obviously only less than half are really above average. The 
    others are self-deceived. This may also be the case with us. </font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">To prevent such a fate, we will enter 
    into a study of learning theory as it relates to leadership. We will focus 
    on two of the major schools of thought in this area--Behaviorism-Social Learning, 
    and Cognitive-Discovery approaches. Both have much to offer the thoughtful 
    Christian leader. </font></font></p>

      <p align="CENTER"><b><font face="Times" size="4">Insight: Thorndike&#151;Three 
        Laws of Learning</font></b></p>
      <font face="Times" size="4"> 
      <p>Edward L. Thorndike formulated three primary laws of learning: readiness, 
        exercise, and effect.</p>
      <p>1. <i>The Law of Readiness</i>. This law simply means that an organism 
        will learn more quickly if it is ready to learn. For example, if you are 
        hungry, not having eaten all day long, and someone invites you to go to 
        a hamburger stand, you are going to respond immediately because of your 
        readiness to do so. In your classroom, if you conduct the class in such 
        a manner as to have the children anticipating with excitement the particular 
        item or principle or event about which they are going to learn, they will 
        be much more apt to learn it.</p>
      <p>2. <i>The Law of Exercise</i>. This law, by its very title, gives itself 
        away. Exercise strengthens the bond between stimulus and response. To 
        put it another way, the more one practices a certain response, the more 
        apt it is to be retained. In your classroom, if your students are learning 
        the numbers to be multiplied, such as two times two, or four times four, 
        and then the appropriate answer, the more times this is gone over, the 
        more probable it is your students will retain the results.</p>
      <p>3. <i>The Law of Effect</i>. A response (behavior) is strengthened if 
        it is followed by pleasure and weakened if followed by displeasure. That 
        is, of course, the forerunner of B.F. Skinner's reinforcement theory. 
        It is the idea of a reward's strengthening any particular behavior.</p>
      <p>Critics of Thorndike's laws of learning emphasize that they appear 
        to be quite mechanical, they do not appear to leave room for any sort 
        of cognitive processing on the part of the student and they do not require 
        that there be any kind of purposiveness in humankind.

    <p><font size="+1">A major advance in behaviorism stems from the work of <u>Clark 
      Hull</u> at Yale in the 1930's. His research and theory made motivation 
      (&quot;drive reduction&quot;) the critical factor in reinforcement. </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1"><u>John B. Watson</u> (1874-1949) has been called the &quot;father 
      of American behaviorism.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1"><u>B. F. Skinner</u> is considered the Father of operant 
      conditioning, and the principle spokesman for behaviorism for many years. 
      Operant conditioning is a type of learning where a given behavior is followed 
      either by reinforcement (leading to the strengthening of that behavior), 
      nothing (leading to the weakening of that behavior), or punishment (leading 
      to aversion to that behavior). This is different than classical conditioning, 
      where the stimulus precedes or accompanies the response. </font></p>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p><font size="+1"><u><b>Important Terms in Behaviorism</b></u><br>
  <br>
  </font> 
<ul>
  <ul>
    <p><font size="+1"><u>Instrumental Conditioning</u> - A type of learning where 
      the &quot;response&quot; or behavior of the learner is instrumental in determining 
      the amount and type of reinforcement received. For lay purposes, instrumental 
      conditioning can be considered synonymous with operant conditioning.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1"><u>Contingency reinforcement</u> - refers to units of learning 
      where reinforcement is contingent upon behavior. A contingency of reinforcement 
      is a sequence within which a response is followed by a reinforcing stimulus. 
      The &quot;operant&quot; (any particular behavior) is conditioned to occur 
      more frequently, less frequently, or not at all-- depending upon whether 
      it is reinforced, ignored, or punished.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1"><u>Positive reinforcement</u> - When any behavior is followed 
      by positive reinforcement, that behavior will strengthen. A positive reinforcer 
      needs to be desirable to the learner.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1"><u>Negative reinforcement</u> - if response leads to the 
      termination of aversive stimulus it will occur more frequently. For example, 
      if wearing a coat reduces the pain of cold, we will tend to wear a coat 
      more frequently.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1"><u>Loss of reinforcement</u> - behavior will weaken if 
      its occurrence consistently leads to the loss of reinforcers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1"><u>Punishment</u> - Any unpleasant consequence following 
      a behavior consistently tends to weaken that behavior.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1"><u>Modeling</u> - The presentation of behavior to the subject 
      in the hope that it will be imitated.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1"><u>Stimulus paring</u>. The function of any stimulus can 
      transfer to any previously neutral stimulus, if they are consistently paired.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1"><u>Stimulus repetition</u> - Any stimulus presented repeatedly 
      or for a long period of time will lose some or all of its stimulus value. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1"><u>Schedules of reinforcement</u> - Different schedules 
      affect behavior in different ways. With all schedules, the <u>interval</u> 
      between the behavior and the reinforcement has to be quite short to be effective, 
      especially when learning new behaviors. Otherwise, the learner loses the 
      connection between the reinforcement and the behavior. With dogs, for instance, 
      the effectiveness of reinforcement is at its highest 1/2 of one second after 
      the behavior occurs, and rapidly falls off after 10 seconds. Times are somewhat 
      longer for humans. Once a behavior is learned, the interval can be much 
      greater, or reinforcement can even be missing altogether some of the time, 
      without weakening the behavior. The main schedules of reinforcement referred 
      to in operant conditioning are:</font> 
    <ul>
      <li><font size="+1"><u>Continuous</u> = rewarding every time the desired 
        behavior occurs. </font></li>
      <li><font size="+1"><u>Intermittent</u> = only some of the times the behavior 
        occurs. Types of intermittent reinforcement include:</font></li>
      <li> <font size="+1"><u>Fixed Ratio</u> = reward every second or fourth 
        response etc.</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1"><u>Fixed Interval</u> = rewarding every two or four 
        minutes etc.</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1"><u>Variable Interval</u> = sporadic rewarding of desired 
        response</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1"><u>Variable Ratio</u> = rewarding desired responses 
        every few incidents of response, according to an unpredictable schedule. 
        </font></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p><font size="+2"><b>Assessment</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Strict Behaviorism focuses on contingent reinforcement learning. 
  There can be little doubt that conditioning of the kind demonstrated by behaviorists 
  is a real fact of life. They have merely dissected and analyzed a process that 
  we are all familiar with anyway, and they have subjected it to extensive laboratory 
  testing. Their experiments with learning in animals have made it possible to 
  draw important conclusions about how learning occurs. These findings have also 
  been confirmed to a great extent in experiments with humans. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">However, some of the philosophical and experimental claims 
  made by behaviorists are open to question. Their basic &quot;S-R&quot; (stimulus-response) 
  approach to behavior leaves much in human behavior unexplained. We will consider 
  some of the important implications of behaviorist research for Christian leadership 
  later. For now, I suggest we acknowledge that operant and classical conditioning 
  account for some, but not all learning in humans. Classic behaviorism is an 
  oversimplified understanding of human behavior.</font> 
<p><b><font size="+1">Social Learning theory</font></b></p>
<p><font size="+1">In the social learning model, we have a more complete and palatable 
  framework for understanding learning. Social learning theory fills many of the 
  gaps in sophisticated human learning that pure (or &quot;radical&quot;) behaviorism 
  has failed to explain. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Albert Bandura, a professor at Stanford University, is considered 
  the father of social learning theory. Social learning theory is based on behaviorism, 
  but different in four ways: </font> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times" size="+1">1. <u><b>The way a child acquires a novel behavior</b></u> 
    can come from imitation of others as well as chance happening onto a behavior 
    followed by reinforcement. Therefore, new behaviors are not &quot;lucky hits&quot; 
    but the result of actual attempts to reproduce what they observe. This amounts 
    to vicarious conditioning. It is not necessary for the person to experience 
    the reinforcement himself, he can watch another's experience, and embrace 
    the other's conditioning as his own.</font></p>
  <p> <font face="Times" size="+1">2. <u><b>The manner in which one learns from 
    models</b></u> Five distinct steps to this kind of learning are detailed by 
    Bandura. See the insight box on &quot;Learning from Models&quot; (Fig.&nbsp;2). 
    </font></p>
</blockquote>
<table border="1" width="85%" bgcolor="#00FFFF" align="center">
  <tr> 
    <td width="85%" bgcolor="#9E0722"><b> 
      <p align="CENTER"><font size="4">Insight: Learning from Models</font></p>
      </b><font size="4"> 
      <p>The process of learning from models consists of five main functions:</p>
      <p>1. The child must attend to the pertinent clues. The child may misdirect 
        her attention at the time the model is observed, and therefore fail to 
        perform the behavior properly later. A teacher can help by directing the 
        child's attention to those parts of the model's performance that are most 
        important.</p>
      <p>2. The child must code for memory. That is, a visual image must be stored 
        in the memory for the particular behavior that the child has witnessed. 
        Older children learn more readily from looking at others' performances 
        than do younger children, because of the cumulative effect of the storage 
        in the memory. The development of language, and of schemes for coding 
        the observations, improves the child's ability to profit from watching 
        models.</p>
      <p>3. The child must be able to retain in her memory that which she has 
        observed, so that it will be available when needed. Memories do fade or 
        disappear with time, so memory-aiding techniques such as rehearsal or 
        review or practice help to maintain the image in the child's memory.</p>
      <p>4. The child must reproduce the observed motor activities accurately. 
        The child must not only get the idea of the behaviors to perform but she 
        must also get the muscular feel of behavior. According to Bandura, usually 
        the child cannot do this perfectly on the first trial, and thus the child 
        needs a number of trials in which she seeks to approximate the behavior. 
        The older child will probably perform the model activities better, because 
        her muscular development is better advanced than the younger child's.</p>
      <p>5. The child must be motivated to carry through all the steps in the 
        process of learning from models. The crucial role of the consequences 
        of the behavior enter the picture at this point. The child must understand 
        that in the future this would be a good way to behave under particular 
        sets of circumstances.

    <p><font size="+1">3. <u><b>The influence of consequences on future actions</b></u>: 
      Rather than agree with radical behaviorists that a reinforcement will automatically 
      result in repetition of the response, Bandura says, &quot;Although the issue 
      is not yet completely resolved, there is little evidence that reinforcers 
      function as automatic shapers of human conduct.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A vast amount 
      of evidence lends validity to the view that reinforcement serves principally 
      as an informative and motivational operation rather than as a mechanical

      Children typically acquire large segments of new behavior at once, not gradual

<ul>
  <ul>
    <font size="+1">The work of neuropsychologists in recent years has given credence 
    to the idea that intuitive creative, synthesizing thought is as valuable as

    authors and preachers. While most of this criticism is deserved from the theistic 
    perspective, Christian leaders and educators may overlook the positive contributions 
    from behaviorism to a Christian understanding of human motivation and learning. 
    The fact is that God resorts to operant conditioning in dealing with people, 
    even though without the mechanistic overtones implied in radical behaviorism. 
    Also, instrumental, or operant conditioning is apparently called for in the 
    rearing of children (Prov. 6:23; 10:13; 13:24; 15:10; 19:18; 22:15; 22:13;

  <p><font size="+1">Clearly, this position is objectionable at least part of 
    the time. The question is, can we benefit from a perspective that grows out 
    of an unacceptable philosophical base? Here the answer should be, &quot;yes.&quot; 
    Skinner's efforts to explain <u>everything</u> on the basis of contingent 
    reinforcement fail, but this does not mean he fails to explain <u>some</u> 
    things. Even in the field of religion, how would the Christian best explain 
    devotion in another religious complex that is unbiblical? Why is the Muslim 
    devoted? Indeed, why do nominal Christians practice their liturgies? In many 
    of these cases, the best answer is probably to be found in the area of contingent 
    reinforcement.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Behavioral engineering is myopic and simplistic in its understanding

    It also makes no distinction between legitimate training and manipulation.</font></p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Punishment</font></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">Behaviorists criticize the typical classroom for failure 
    to provide positive reinforcement in learning. Extra homework, scolding, withdrawal 
    of privileges, and spanking (all in the punishment category) tend to be the 
    main tools of motivation in ineffective classrooms. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Notice that punishment is different than negative reinforcement, 
    both in intent and effect. Negative reinforcement directly reinforces desired 
    behavior (by the reward of drive abatement or reduction of irritating stimuli) 
    while punishment relates not to desired behavior, but to undesirable behavior. 
    The hope is, of course, that terminating negative behavior will leave only 
    desired behavior, but this is not necessarily the result. For this reason, 
    punishment has severe limitations on its ability to encourage behavior or 
    learning. Barlow explains: </font> </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <font size="+1">The student who is kept at his work by punishment may learn 
    to dislike school. Punishment often causes the child to be hostile, to dislike 
    the one administering the punishment, to become stubborn.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. However 
    it is important for the child to know that, if necessary, the teacher or principal 
    <i>will use the strong forms of punishment</i>. Although punishment is necessary 
    in our view, it should be used sparingly and wisely.</font> 
  </ul>

  <p><font size="+1">Ericksen agrees, </font> </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <p><font size="+1">Basic and applied research on reinforcement confirms the 
      dominance of reward over punishment. This reminder is relevant to instruction 
      because it is so easy to make comments that are critical, negative, caustic, 
      and threatening about what a student believes, says, and does. A direct 
      or implied put-down to a student can quickly undo the tenuous allegiance 
      and feelings of identification toward the teacher and the area of knowledge 
      he or she represents.&quot;</font> </p>
    <p><font size="+1">One explanation for the high rate of forgetting what was 
      once read or heard is that this information is never, or rarely, reinforced 
      by subsequent events in the students life.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;</font> </p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">The application for the Christian leader seems to be that 
    positive reinforcers that are appreciated by the learner need to be devised 
    and employed in connection with learning. We may foolishly neglect to use 
    positive reinforcement, which accounts for reduced effectiveness in our attempts 
    to motivate others. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Improper Reinforcement</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">Another possible error would be to accidentally apply reinforcement 
    (either positive or negative) to undesirable rather than desired behavior. 
    For instance, a member may be irritated by the lack of attention shown by 
    a leader. Then, as spiritual problems and grumbling surface in the member's 
    life, the leader rushes in to avoid crisis. The result is that the undesirable 
    behavior is accidentally reinforced. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Schedules of reinforcement need to be carefully considered 
    in leadership as well. Improper schedule of reinforcement can result in a 
    complete breakdown in learning.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">For example, ultimate rewards from education (e.g. that the 
    student can get a good job, that she can become a Bible teacher, etc.) are 
    not effective as positive reinforcers because they are ultimate--they are 
    not experienced until the end of the educational process which is far too 
    long an interval for effective reinforcement. A student may really want to 
    be a teacher, but does this help when he is trying to concentrate on his studies 
    on a weekday night? We need to consider what would constitute good immediate 
    reinforcement in a learning situation.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Interestingly, intermittent schedules of reinforcement are 
    far more effective in eliciting academic learning behavior than a continuous 
    schedule. Ericksen says, </font> </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">So far as teaching is concerned, a significant finding 
        is the holding power of being reinforced only once in a while--the slot-machine 
        or patient fisherman phenomenon. For reasons that are still a matter of 
        theoretical debate, material learned under conditions of aperiodic [intermittent 
        and irregular] reinforcement remains in memory better than if it were 
        learned under constant or regular reinforcement. Information from the 
        teacher that the student is correct need not be given after every response.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times"><b><font size="+1">Cognitive-Discovery Learning Theory</font></b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">Four schools of learning theory that differ 
    from behaviorism are Gestalt Psychology, Field theory of Learning, Cognitive 
    Structure Learning Theory, and Discovery Learning theory. All of these are 
    similar to each other, because they stress the importance of understanding 
    <i>patterns</i> or <i>relationships</i> between particulars in a field of 
    knowledge. </font> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times"><b><font size="+1">Gestalt Psychology</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">Gestalt is a German word usually translated 
    &quot;form&quot; or &quot;pattern.&quot; The heart of gestalt theory as it 
    applies to learning is that &quot;meaningful configurations are greater than 
    the mere sum of their parts.&quot; Gestalt theorists argue that learning occurs 
    when the learner attains insight. Insight, in this framework means the discovery 
    of new relationships between particulars by an individual. An important difference 
    can be seen between rote memorization on one hand, and on the other hand, 
    understanding interrelationships between various facts in a field of knowledge. 
    &quot;The gestalt view calls attention to the fact that many things are learned 
    when we arrange ideas into patterns. We do not just add together impressions; 
    we grasp how they are related.&quot;</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">In 1916, Wolfgang Kohler demonstrated 
    that learning is by &quot;insight&quot; by which he meant perceiving relationships. 
    A chimpanzee had learned to use short sticks in his cage to pull things toward 
    himself. Kohler placed a longer stick just out of reach outside the cage, 
    and a banana even farther away. After trying to reach the banana with the 
    shorter stick, the chimp went and sat in the corner for some time. Finally, 
    he got up and used the shorter stick to drag the longer stick in, and then 
    used the longer stick to drag in the banana. Kohler argued that the chimp 
    had gained insight into (or learned) the relationship between the two sticks 
    and the banana. </font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">Insight develops when perceptions are 
    suddenly organized. We see that this sort of learning does not clearly fit 
    into a behaviorist scenario. The sequence was too complex to be an accident, 
    and since it had not been trained or modeled before, it seems likely that 
    insight was in fact arrived at as a result of some cognitive process. </font> 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times"><b><font size="+1">Field Theory</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">Kurt Lewin has developed a terminology 
    based on comparing a human's field of knowledge and experience to magnetic 
    fields. This issues in the field theory of learning. Both of these kinds of 
    theories call attention to the fact that behavioral and cognitive elements 
    are interrelated and that the development of the current relationship of these 
    particulars is crucial to a correct understanding both of the current state 
    of person's thinking, and of the needs for further development. One of the 
    values of cognitive-discovery approaches is that they give credit to the complexity 
    of thinking necessary to move beyond simple cataloguing of material. </font>

  <p><font face="Times"><b><font size="+1">Cognitive Structure Theories</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">Jerome Bruner is another noted psychologist 
    who has written on the need for a cognitive structure approach to learning. 
    Like the Gestalt theorists, he insists that students should be assisted in 
    grasping the overall <i>structure</i> of a given field of study. Structure 
    again stresses the importance of relationships within the field. Bruner argues 
    that too much learning occurs as step-by-step study of statements or formulas 
    to be reproduced by the student on cue. The result of such programmed materials 
    is that the student cannot use the material outside of the class room. See 
    Bruner's principles summarized in Fig.&nbsp;4</font></font></p>

          <p align="CENTER">Insight: Features of a Theory of Instruction (Bruner)</p>
          </b> 
          <p>Jerome Bruner, in his book <i>Toward a Theory of Instruction, </i>outlines 
            four features he believes should be included within a theory of instruction.</p>
          <p>1. The theory should make clean and precise the conditions that predispose 
            individuals toward learning. Bruner believes that the experiences 
            that contribute to an individual's desire to learn, not only in general 
            but to master particular material, should be stated clearly.</p>
          <p>2. Bruner emphasizes that a theory of instruction should describe 
            precisely the ways in which a particular body of knowledge is to be 
            structured so that the students can most readily grasp it and use 
            it. Bruner believes that no matter what the content of the learning, 
            if that material is organized appropriately, it can be presented in 
            a form that is simple enough for any learner to understand.</p>
          <p>3. The third feature in a theory of instruction, according to Bruner, 
            should be a detailing of the most effective sequences by which that 
            material may be presented, taking into account the learner, the difficulty 
            of the material, and the logical sequencing of its ideas and content. 
            Bruner's thrust is that the process of instruction should increase 
            the learner's ability to &quot;grasp, transform, and transfer what 
            he is learning.&quot;</p>
          <p>4. Bruner stresses that a theory of instruction should make very 
            clear the nature and the pacing of the rewards. Bruner stresses that, 
            ideally, educators should move gradually from rewarding extrinsically 
            to helping the student is grasp intrinsic satisfaction. This is, of 
            course, a part of the cognitive view, that the student should become 
            less dependent upon the teacher's rewarding behavior and more dependent 
            upon his own intrinsic satisfaction in seeking to work through to 
            a solution of the learning task itself. Bruner stresses in this regard 
            that the timing of when the rewards are given is of great importance. 
            If the student gets rewarded too early, he may not be interested in 
            exploring any further. If he gets rewarded or feedback comes too late, 
            it may not really be relevant or helpful. In effect, Bruner is adding 
            what we might term &quot;sensitive timing&quot; to the already great 
            responsibility of the teacher in the teaching-learning process.</p>

    use them effectively. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">In the case of Cognitive-Structure theory, on the other hand, 
    it is not so clear that we are necessarily applying these principles of learning

<p><font size="+1">Most of our material on creating change can be found in the 
  papers on <a href="motivate.html">Motivation</a>, <a href="learningtheory.html">Learning</a>, 
  and <a href="visionandleadership.htm">Vision</a>. However, we should consider 
  a number of special factors when our leadership is taking people from an established 
  way of doing things to a new way.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1. Does our new direction seem to contradict theological positions 
  taken earlier?</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">If we persuaded people that a certain direction was either 
    biblical or more in harmony with biblical teaching earlier, and now we are 
    calling on them to go a different direction, we can anticipate some strong 
    resistance, and such resistance is certainly reasonable. Leaders should anticipate 
    this, and be ready:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">Since nothing has changed in the Bible, why would our understanding 
      change? Was it that conditions in our ministry field changed? Was it that 
      we now feel we were mistaken in our earlier understanding? Have we come 
      to appreciate a broader understanding of key passages? Is it that both the 
      old way and the new way can be harmonized with the biblical material?</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Whichever may be the case, prepare to take your people 
      through the same thought processes that you have gone through as leaders. 
      Be prepared for a loss of credibility initially, especially if you admit 
      your were wrong, but anticipate that by being honest and open, you will 
      gain credibility in the end.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">2. Who has the most to lose?</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">When the rules change, everyone goes back to 0. This is why 
    old timers often have the biggest stake in the status quo. Begin with the 
    old guard, and show them why the risks are manageable and the potential benefits 
    for them are great.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">In some cases, we may fail to win the support of the old 
    guard, and yet we are convinced the change is important enough to go ahead 
    with anyway. In cases like this, be aware that a struggle is inevitable, and 
    it could be costly. Be prepared to withstand the punishment disgruntled members 
    may dish out, in the knowledge that many will come around in the end, if the 
    change is as helpful as you predict.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Of course we never have a guarantee that our calls for change 
    will work out, or, even if they do, that people will recognize the value. 
    We have to be prepared at times to pay a heavy price, including loss of members, 
    in order to bring about change we feel is vital.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> 3. Have you taught a theology of the church that anticipates 
  regular change? </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">Long before actual change is needed, we should seek to regularly 
    press for an ethos of adaptability and change. Stress the carnality of those 
    who hold to control over change, and point out their inability to follow the 
    Holy Spirit. Use illustrations like the tabernacle vs. the temple, and the 
    book of Acts, were God had trouble getting the early Christians to change. 
    When change comes, well-led churches can refer to this body of teaching, which 
    has already become part of the consensus of the church.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">4. Are you moving too fast in implementing change?</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">Take your time. I am continually amazed at how slowly people 
    come to understand the need for change and how slowly they come to understand 
    what changes we are proposing. You will have to repeat yourself much more 
    often than you would guess. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">5. Action steps </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">Author Bruce Powers describes the process of implementing 
    change as follows: <br>
    1) Thaw the current situation. In other words, show people why change is needed. 
    This could involve showing people problems with the status quo, as well as 
    benefits in change. <br>
    2) Pursue change to the appropriate level of tension. Too little tension results 
    in no change. Too much tension leads to people avoiding each other, failure 
    to communicate, rabbit trails, and disengagement. Here are some practical 
    steps:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">a) Begin with your inner circle, or leadership colleagues.
        Take the time to see them fully embrace the need for change (not just
        acquiescing
      to change you want). They will have to help you struggle with the church
        for change, and they, too, will have to pay a price for change, so you
        need
      them fully onboard. </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">b) Together with your colleagues, collect a list of benefits 
      connected with the change. And a list of dangers if you fail to change. 
      These dangers are very important, as people fear change, and must be shown 
      that failure to change deserves fear as well.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">c) Next go to your other committed workers. Do this in
        concert with your fellow leaders. Again, allow time for open debate and
        slow movement from one paradigm to another. People change their minds
        slowly,
      and not without inner conflict, so don't be thin-skinned if people resist
        your direction. They may even take this opportunity to launch accusations
        or doubts about your leadership. Such dissent becomes a real test of
        the
      stability and strength of your leadership. The leadership team should be
        prepared to defend one another, and to redirect the topic back to the
        issue
      at hand.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">d) Take on-going dissenters aside for personal counseling 
      on the issue. Try to understand their worries or reservations. Be prepared 
      to negotiate on any points that won't impair the change. In the end, we 
      have to be prepared to go ahead with, or without the support of such dissenters, 
      but we will clearly have fewer problems if we can win them over to at least 
      giving change a chance.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">e) Develop a written outline of the changes you are proposing 
      and the reasons for it, and make copies for all. This will hopefully cut 
      down on distortions and confusion (assuming the outline is succinct and 
      well-written).</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">f) Finally, in most cases, schedule a time to discuss
        the change with the whole church if the change is major. Alternatively,
        if the
      change is not expected to be very controversial, you may decide to have
        various leaders take it separately to their own cell groups. Have your
        facts
      ready, and announce the change as something the leadership thinks is a
        good idea, and would like everyone to support. This is in contrast to
        a democratic
      approach (&quot;Do you guys agree we should do this?&quot; or &quot;What 
      does everyone think?&quot;). Only if the change is considered very unimportant 
      to the health of the church should you leave the decision up to the whole 
      group. God has set leaders in the church to lead, and a democratic approach 
      empowers the least mature Christians more than the most mature. If you do 
      elect to approach the issue democratically, you are obligated to honor the 
      vote taken.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">g) Return to the issue some weeks or months later, and 
      review what the results of the change have been. This is especially important 
      when the results have been good. Use this as an opportunity to remind them 
      how worried we were, but how this worked out really well, and we should 
      remember this in the future.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">If your group is accustomed to periodic change, and if they 
  understand the need for change, you will have a more leadable and adaptable 
  group. If your group becomes too conservative, you will live in a straight-jacket 
  that will choke out growth and lead you on the high road to being just like 
  the institutional church.</font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style1>To succeed in evangelism we must be bold in our faith.  Yet
  most of us struggle to some degree with fear of rejection when we think about
  sharing our faith.  This may be the biggest barrier that we face!  Timothy
  was a fearful, yet effective minister for Christ.  Paul wrote to Timothy to
  offer encouragement: </p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1>2 Timothy 1:7,8  “<span style='layout-grid-mode:both'>For
    God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline.  Therefore
    do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, or of me His prisoner; but
    join with </span>me<span style='layout-grid-mode:both'> in suffering for
    the gospel according to the power of God&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1><span style='layout-grid-mode:both'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1><span style='layout-grid-mode:both'>Key points from
    this passage that you should discuss in your group include:</span></p>

    Timothy to God’s part in evangelism (“power and love and discipline. . .
    according to the power of God. . .”).  To cultivate boldness, we must know
    and focus on what God promises to do in this area.  God’s power is manifest
    in evangelism in four ways:</span></p>

<p class=LevelB style1><b>Our part</b>: Paul also calls on Timothy to do his
  part (“do not be ashamed of the testimony. . . join with me in suffering for
  the gospel.”).  We need to express our trust that God will do his part by actually
  stepping out in faith to be his witnesses!  </p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1><span style='layout-grid-mode:both'>Sometimes we feel
    that it will take a long time to regain our confidence in evangelism, but
    reaffirming God’s part and stepping out in faith will usually produce an
    immediate increase in confidence.  The following sections are meant to be
    covered in a cell group or workers’ meeting format.  You will probably need
    two weeks to cover this material.</span></p>

<p align=center class=MsoNormal style1 style='text-align:center'><b>Questions
    that may initiate Spiritual Conversations </b></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1>Many people are willing to talk about spiritual matters,
  but only rarely will they initiate a spiritual conversation with you.  One
  way we can provide them with this opportunity is to ask spiritual questions.  Here
  are some interesting and thought-provoking questions that could help you start
  a spiritual conversation.  We are not suggesting a formula; each of these should
  be put in your own words so that you speak from your heart.  Remember that
  your goal is not necessarily to share the gospel in this conversation, but
  to make the person more comfortable discussing spiritual things—which will
  likely lead to further discussions.  Discuss these ideas in your cell group
  and consider other ways to pose the questions to get at the same spiritual
  issue.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1 style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>“Do you
    have any type of spiritual belief</u>?”&nbsp; OR “<u>Do you have a spiritual
    category for that</u>?”  Through this type of question we learn what they
    believe.  The most important thing to do is to <i>listen carefully </i>and
    ask follow-up questions.  &nbsp; Often you get &quot;I'm a Catholic, Methodist,
    etc&quot; response.&nbsp;  You could then ask them, “What was you’re your
    experience like growing up Catholic?”  <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1 style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>&quot;What
    kind of spiritual background/church did you have growing up?&quot;</u>  This
    may be an easier question to pursue with some people than #1.  Most people
    are willing to answer it because it simply asks for historical information
    and does not call on them to take a position on a system of belief.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1 style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>“If you
    died this week, where would you go</u>?” OR “<u>What do you think happens
    to people when they die?”</u>&nbsp;  Discussions about the afterlife are
    often very helpful.  Consider following up this question with,&nbsp; “<u>Why
    do you think you would go there</u>?”&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1 style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in'>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>“If what
    you believe is&nbsp;not true, would you&nbsp;want to know</u>?”  &nbsp;Through
    this question we can find whether they are ready to take a new step.&nbsp; Those
    who have experience asking this question have found that most people answer
    “Yes” and are open.  If the individual says, “No,” we need to carefully read
    their response and decide whether to ask them why, or simply move to a different
    subject.  </p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1 style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in'>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>“Would
    you mind if I shared something that someone told me</u>?”&nbsp;OR “<u>Is
    it ok if I tell you about my spiritual beliefs?”</u>  If they don’t want
    to pursue this, let it go.  But if they are open, you can proceed with the
    gospel.&nbsp; Always use scripture and if possible open your Bible and allow
    them to read the scripture you refer to.  The paper <i>The Logic of Salvation </i>(<a
href="../papers/logic.htm">http://www.xenos.org/classes/papers<span class=MsoHyperlink>/logic.htm</span></a>) provides an excellent framework
  for presenting the Gospel.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1 style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in'>6.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>“Who
    do you think (believe) Jesus is(was)?</u>”  If Jesus comes up in the discussion,
    then this type of question can be very helpful.  This is another way to get
    to the Gospel as you describe the unique person and mission of Jesus.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1 style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in'>7.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>&quot;What
    kind of evidence would it take for you to be willing to invite Jesus into
    your heart?&quot;</u><span style='font-family:Arial;color:blue'>&nbsp; </span>People
    often don't know how to answer this question--but that in itself may help
    them.&nbsp; It also gives the asker the opportunity to share how much evidence
    they had before they asked Christ--and what happened when they did.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1 style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in'>8.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>“Do you
    ever pray?”</u> OR <u>“Would you be willing to pray about what we’ve been
    discussing?”</u>  If they say, “Yes,” encourage them to simply call out to
    God and ask that he reveal himself.  You might share John 7:17, “If any man
    is willing to do His will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of
    God, or whether I speak from Myself.”<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1 style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in'>9.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>“Would
    it be ok with you if I pray for you right now?</u>”  This will open the door
    for you to bring God into the situation and demonstrate a personal prayer.  In
    your prayer you can take their personal questions or concerns to God.  You
    will be amazed how often non-Christians are deeply moved by this type of
    personal prayer in their presence.  Consider asking them if they would like
    to pray aloud (or silently) with you.  <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1 style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in'>10.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span><u>“What do you want to accomplish
    in life?”</u> OR “<u>What is the purpose of life (or a specific part of your
    life)?</u>”  These questions get at the issue of life purpose which is a
    hot topic today.  The fact the Rich Warren’s <i>Purpose Driven Life</i> is
    a New York Times Best Seller demonstrates that people are considering this
    issue.  You might consider suggesting that your friend read this book.<u><br>
</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1>Questions like these will prime the pump, but we must
  be good listeners to establish good conversations.  In James 1:19 we read,
  “This you know, my beloved brethren. But let everyone be <i>quick to hear,
  slow to speak</i> and slow to anger. . .”  Good listeners often find receptivity
  to their point of view since they show concern and respect for the other person.
  [See Watchman Nee. <i>Character of God's Workman</i>. Chapter on Listening].</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1><b>Exercise:</b><br>
  After discussing these questions in the group, have each person take about
    fifteen minutes to prayerfully consider the content in view of their non-Christian
    friends.   Then they should determine how they would put the content in their
    own words and write out a few questions.  They could share these with the
    group or you could break up into groups of three or four to share their questions.</p>
<p align=center class=MsoNormal style1 style='text-align:center'><b><br>
  From Chit-chat to the Gospel</b></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1><br>
  Common conversation provides many opportunities to explore spiritual issues.  Some
  of us have the misconception that a deep personal relationship is needed to
  discuss spiritual things.  As a result, we have spiritual conversations with
  non-Christians only rarely—and little evangelistic fruit.  Many of us need
  to be more open about our spiritual interests in casual conversations so we
  have opportunities to find receptive people.  When it comes right down to it,
  most adults are so busy that it’s very difficult to build a close friendship
  outside the church.  If we wait to get close to someone before we mention spiritual
  issues, we won’t be discussing spiritual issues very often.  </p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1>We need to be willing to talk as naturally and openly
  about our relationship with Christ as we would any other important aspect of
  our lives.  This paper provides a few suggestions for how we can apply this
  principle.  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Review these in your cell group and with each discuss other ideas for the
  particular situation.  Encourage each member to think of how they could apply
  these ideas to their situation.</i></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1><b>Responses to common questions:</b></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1>Creative responses test for spiritual interest.  We
  need to be positive, open, and enthusiastic about our spiritual life.  Most
  of us fear that people will think we’re some kind of nut if we are enthusiastic
  about the Lord, but we need to put that fear behind us and not be so inhibited.  Here
  are a few examples of responses to common questions:</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start=1 type=1 class="style1" style='margin-top:0in'>

  <li class=MsoNormal>How’s the family?  The patent answer is “Great. . .”  “John
    is playing soccer.  Beth got a scholarship to Harvard.  Albert is going to
    OSU.”  People put their best foot forward.  Where’s the reality of family
    life?</li>
  <ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=a>
    <li class=MsoNormal>We’re doing ok, but it’s been a real struggle for me

      good friends and God’s help we’re making some progress.</li>
    <li class=MsoNormal>I’ve made some big mistakes financially and now we’re
      working hard to get out from under it.  I’ve been studying the Bible and
      getting God’s perspective on my money, so I believe there’s hope. </li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p class=MsoNormal style1 style='margin-left:.75in'>Responses like these will
  disarm people and open many doors to spiritual conversation.</p>

  <li class=MsoNormal>What are you doing this weekend?  <br>
    Don’t be afraid to discuss the spiritual things we pursue?</li>

    <li class=MsoNormal>Sunday I’m going to our church.  I don’t like to miss
      that because I learn something about every week that’s helpful.</li>
    <li class=MsoNormal>We’re going camping with a group of friends from our
      church.  We’ve gotten to be really close over the years and it’s a great
      experience.</li>

</ol>
<p class=MsoNormal style1>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1><b>Initiating Natural Conversation about Spiritual
    Issues</b></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1>Besides responding to these basic questions as we’ve
  discussed above, we should also open and forthright about their relationship
  with God.  We need to be willing to discuss our relationship with God like
  we would other things in our life that we’re excited about.  For example, if
  you attended a great concert, you would naturally and enthusiastically tell
  your friends and co-workers about it.  In the same way we need to be open about
  the excitement that comes from faithfully following Christ.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1 style='margin-left:.25in'><b>Consider the way God is
    personally affecting you and think how you could introduce the topic into
    conversation</b>.  These may be areas that we find encouraging and exciting,
    but on the other hand challenging and perplexing issues can and sometimes
    should be discussed with our non-Christian friends.  Examples: </p>
<ul type=disc class="style1" style='margin-top:0in'>
  <li class=MsoNormal>I’ve been experiencing God’s peace when I used to be overwhelmed
    with anxiety.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>I just can’t get over how wonderful it is to have Christian
    friends who show me God’s love.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Parenting has been very difficult lately and the hardships
    have made me wrestle with God’s faithfulness in my life.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>I’ve been perplexed as I’ve tried to figure out God’s will
    for my career.  </li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>My wife and I are realizing that we could relate a lot
    better if we prayed together more often.</li>
</ul>
<p class=MsoNormal style1>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1><b>Reading their response</b></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1>Reading responses in conversation takes a lot of experience
  and there’s no real formula to follow, but these guidelines will be helpful
  to consider:</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1 style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
  they express interest in spiritual things then feel free to share more, including
  the gospel and/or inviting them to an event or Bible study.  Consider inviting
  them to study the Bible with you one-on-one too.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1 style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
  they respond negatively, this is <i>a great opportunity</i> to understand why
  they are negative about what you shared.  Ask questions to identify the source
  of their negativity: previous bad experiences, misconceptions, etc.  This will
  provide an opportunity for you to share the difference between biblical Christianity
  and their misconceptions.  </p>
<p class=MsoNormal style1 style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
  they have no response, we should not push at this point, but remain confident
  that because God is at work our friend may be open to future spiritual conversations.  You
  will probably feel more confident to discuss spiritual issues in the future.</p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Xenos home churches are led by teams of leaders instead 
  of single leaders. Team leadership has a number of advantages, but can cause 
  problems as well. A successful Home Church must maintain the unity of its leaders. 
  Disunited leaderships are nearly always incapable of leading Home Church growth. 
  The strength of relationships among leaders directly affects the quality of 
  Home Church meetings. Strong Home Churches nearly always have leaderships with 
  skilled encouragers and visionaries on board, and the maturity to work as a 
  team. For all these reasons, it is essential that Home Church leaders learn 
  to deal with their conflicts maturely and quickly. When working with fellow 
  leaders, the following considerations are helpful. </font></b></p>
</font> 
<ol>
  <ol>
    <font face="Times"> 
    <li><font size="+1"><b>Encouraging fellow leaders</b></font></li>
    </font> 
    <ol type="a">
      <li><font size="+1">Can you name personal characteristics you admire in 
        each of your fellow leaders? If not, you need to spend time with God pleading 
        for a more realistic and fair assessment of your colleagues.</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Can you name other leaders' accomplishments you appreciate 
        for each leader? Again, pray for your eyes to be opened, and for the humility 
        to admit others' value to the ministry.</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Have you articulated any of these points to your fellow 
        leaders in person during the past two months? If not, you are grossly 
        tardy in your encouraging role. They will find criticisms and advice hard 
        to accept from you if you are weak in encouragement.</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Pray for vision for each of your fellow leaders. Ask 
        God to show you why their unique contribution is important. Then look 
        for an opportunity to express your vision to each in a non-showy and realistic 
        fashion.</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Pray together for each other. Make your prayer times 
        opportunities to review what God has bestowed on the church through each 
        of your leaders, not just a time for fretting and problem solving.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <font face="Times"> 
    <li><font size="+1"><b>Resolving Personal Conflicts</b></font></li>
    </font> 
    <ol type="a">
      <li><font size="+1">Take time to spell out and resolve conflicts as they 
        arise. Help each other resolve personal problems.</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Encourage each other whenever possible. Controversy 
        needs to be balanced with encouragement, kindness, and approval.</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Take time for positive social relating with other leaders. 
        Spending time with your fellow leaders should be a priority</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">If an unresolvable problem arises, seek help from your 
        group's supervisor at the office. </font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Leaders should agree on a realistic, hardworking standard 
        for Home Church leadership. Leaders who are not living by such a standard 
        should be criticized to their face, rather than behind their back, and 
        challenged to step up.</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">If you feel you must offer criticism to a fellow leader, 
        your perception of any shortcomings on the part of other leaders should 
        be objective, and serious. Avoid picking at each other for unimportant 
        issues, which leads to a critical atmosphere.</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Observing the principle of the &quot;man on the Spot&quot;.</font> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font size="+1">1) You should exercise extreme caution when you encounter 
            negative thoughts regarding another leader's ministry work, especially 
            if that work is carried on outside of your own cell. This is because 
            the man (or woman) on the spot is the one who is usually best able 
            to judge what is happening.<br>
            <br>
            The value of other leaders in this situation is mainly that of questioning 
            the situation, rather than defining it. In other words, by a questioning 
            process, the other leaders should bring out any doubts that they have 
            about the ministry of the one on the spot. However, if the answers 
            given are sensible and correspond with objective fact, they should 
            be believed. Also, if a leader contradicts an account given by a member, 
            we should be disposed to believe the leader over the member, according 
            to I Timothy 5:19. However, the passage is actually about elders, 
            and besides, other evidence may cause us to believe the member over 
            the leader. We should certainly report any suspicious incident to 
            our overseer.<br>
            <br>
            It will often be necessary to re-asses your impression after talking 
            to the one on the spot. If doubt lingers, you should usually keep 
            it to yourself until the situation is completely clarified. <br>
            <br>
            Leaders should be very wary of tendencies found in most people to 
            second guess other workers, and to feel that &quot;I know best.&quot; 
            We should be very reluctant to meddle in the decision making process 
            of the leadership of another cell beyond questioning those leaders.</font></p>
          <p><font size="+1">2) All leaders should however, submit to questioning 
            of their ministry by other leaders-- even questioning of a close nature. 
            It is by being questioned that we reexamine our own position, and 
            thus benefit from other leaders. <br>
            <br>
            A leader who refuses to be questioned, or who takes offense at being 
            questioned is displaying an immature attitude that contradicts team 
            leadership. Such refusal becomes an issue in itself, and must be resolved 
            before a reasonable level of cooperation can be expected. While any 
            leader may react defensively at first, we have no excuse for continuing 
            in such a posture. Ultimately, refusal to be questioned by fellow 
            leaders is grounds for dismissal from leadership.<br>
            <br>
            Don't withdraw from a leader who flares up when questioned. This problem 
            won't go away, and must be resolved at any cost. Get help from the 
            office if needed.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li> <font size="+1">Commitment to success. Each Home Church leader should 
        commit his/herself to the goal of seeing real success in the work of all 
        of the other leaders. Unless we can honestly affirm that this is our goal, 
        nothing we say is reliable.</font></li>
      <li> <font size="+1">Communicating Respect. Other leaders should be viewed 
        as colleagues, and treated with all due respect. There should be an assumption 
        of basic competence, and this should be communicated in the demeanor and 
        the words used in a Home Church leaders' meeting. How is respect communicated?</font></li>
    </ol>
    <li><font size="+1">Large Leadership Meetings. It is usually a good idea to 
      have a Home Church leaders' meeting chaired by one of the older leaders. 
      Chairing a meeting does not connote any superiority of position, it is only 
      done for the sake of order and direction in the meeting.</font></li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li> <font size="+1">Focusing the ministry. Unless the leaders are all focusing 
        the majority of their attention and efforts on work that is needed and 
        effective, frustration and negativity will inevitably result. Ascertain 
        whether the bulk of leaders' and workers' time and effort is being used 
        to focus on problems, or on positive, strategically sound ministry. (See 
        Clinton or Lawrence's quadrants)</font></li>

      <p><font size="+1">Ineffective leaders' meetings tend to focus on Quadrants 
        1 and 3. Sometimes, we waste time dwelling on Quadrant 4. We should make 
        sure to prioritize Quadrant #2.<br>
        <br>
        Follow the principle of focusing on the responsive field. Within each 
        ministry sphere, identify the most promising and responsive people at 
        this particular time. Avoid the three most common errors in this area:

          who doesn't want it.</font></li>

          who may demand less, but who are more promising.</font></li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <li><font face="Times"><font size="+1">Dealing with Negativity. Every leadership 
      team and every leader have to deal with negativity and defeatism from time 
      to time. These attitudes are damaging in the extreme to the morale of the 
      Home Church and the workforce. When dealing with negativity, remember the 
      following. </font></font></li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li><font size="+1">Distinguish between negativity and realism. The admission 
        of authentic problems is essential before they can be resolved. However, 
        every problem area should be appraised without exaggeration, and the power 
        of God to work through the situation should be expressly admitted. Considering 
        the power of almighty God, if our admitted problems are leaving us depressed 
        and defeated, have we realistically assessed the situation?</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Leaders need to remind each other that Christian work, 
        like all war, is full of reversals and unexpected misfortune. Yet there 
        are unexpected victories as well! The setbacks we see today should be 
        seen in the light of the overall history of God's working with the Home 
        Church. It is usually easy to see that there have been periodic reversals, 
        but overall progress.</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">Negativity regarding other leaders' ministries is particularly 
        suspicious (see VII,A,2 above-- the man on the spot).</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">We should try to verbally balance negative facts with 
        positive ones in the leader's meeting. It is common to have most of the 
        people in the Home Church earnestly seeking growth, but to focus on the 
        few who are uninterested, or in defeat.</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">A leader who is projecting negativity and defeatism 
        in the leaders meeting should be reminded to express faith in God.</font></li>
      <li><font size="+1">When real problems arise, are the leaders only bemoaning 
        the situation, or are they also creating steps to correct the situation? 
        If no steps are possible, why spend much time discussing that particular 
        situation? While we may need to morn together at times, we also need to 
        move on to the positive agenda of the church.</font></li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
</ol>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">When your leadership team is unified and focused on needed 
    ministry, accountable to each other, well-motivated, and trusting God to act, 
    you can expect good things to happen. If any of these things are missing, 
    on the other hand, you need look no further when wondering what's wrong with 
    your home church.</font></p>

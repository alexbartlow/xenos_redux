<p><font size="+1">Christian workers must clearly understand the role God plays
    in evangelism, discipleship and other aspects of ministry. Unless we consciously
    operate out of a God-centered model of ministry, we will automatically default
    to a human-centered model, and all the defeat that comes with it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A moment's reflection tells us that what we propose to accomplish
    in Christian ministry is supernatural. To reach people's hearts with conviction
    of their need for Christ, to train them up in the faith, to impart the deep
    things of God in a life-changing way, to oppose and defeat powerful evil
    spirits&#151;these are acts that no human can hope to accomplish, no matter
    how intelligent and competent that person may be. The key to ministry success
    is always the same: That God moves through us &quot;leading us in his triumph.&quot; (2&nbsp;Cor.
    2:14) Spiritual failure in ministry is predictable when leaders try to supplant
    the power of God with human charisma, ingenuity, marketing skill, force of
    will, or social manipulation, even when these are supplied from the best
    of motives.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Although no real ministry will go forward without the power
    of God, we should not deny the human part in this process, which would be &quot;super-spirituality.&quot; Paul
    declares that he and the other apostles are &quot;God's fellow workers.&quot; (1&nbsp;Cor.
    3:9) Yes, &quot;neither he who plants nor he who reaps are anything but God
    who causes the growth.&quot; (vs. 7) But this is a figure of speech meaning
    that compared to God, the planter and reaper are nothing. We should not understand
    this hyperbole literalistically. Do we really think that everything would
    have come out the same even if Paul had never gone to Corinth to plant? We
    hold that his planting did make a difference, and Paul argues this as well,
    as the whole point of 1Corinthians 3 is that every Christian leader should &quot;take
    care how he builds.&quot; (vs.10) An honest reading of the Bible reveals
    a strong doctrine of human agency in ministry. God has elected to work though
    human beings, and therefore our actions are important.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">What, then, should we anticipate God will do from his side
    in our ministry? </font> 
<dir> <dir> <dir>
<p><font face="Times" size="+1">In the first place, <b><i>God directs our ministries</i></b>.
    Leaders are to come to the scriptures, and to the Lord in prayer, seeking
    to know his will for our ministry. Ministry that departs from the direction
    God wants may bear some kind of fruit, but becomes &quot;wood hay and stubble&quot; the
    further we depart from the leading of the Holy Spirit. Interestingly, God
    seems willing to continue using ministries that are off-target, apparently
    because he places a higher value on reaching the lost than on complete fidelity
    to his leading. Paul observed this phenomenon in Rome. (Phil.&nbsp;1:15-18)
    This is probably the meaning of Mark 9:38-40 as well. Even in 1 Corinthians
    3, the &quot;wood hay and stubble&quot; may be used by God, but it will not
    be rewarded. In fact, the Bible abounds with examples where God continued
    to use leaders who went astray, sometimes very badly. What are we to conclude? <br>
          <br>
  On one hand, since it is God's will to direct our ministries, we should seek
  that leading often and earnestly. Even though God may continue to use off-target
  ministries, we assume that we will bear more spiritual fruit the closer we
  are to God's ideal. This is increasingly obvious as time goes on. In the short
  term, human-based ministry may look good, but it tends to deteriorate over
  time or bring disgrace upon the Lord's name. On the other hand, we should never
  become paralyzed by the notion that &quot;Unless I know exactly what God wants
  in each situation, I can't move forward.&quot; We can move forward based on
  the general knowledge of what God wants, and in areas we are unsure, we can
  remain open to any correction in our course that God may want to show us, knowing
  that he will not let us come to irreversible harm (Phil. 3:15).<br>
          <br>
  The direction of God extends not only to major issues like whether to preach
  the word or to practice church discipline, but to more subjective areas like
  when someone is ready for leadership, or with whom to invest our discipling
  time and effort. Teachers have to consult God on what slant to take when teaching
  a particular text. Evangelists must ask when to make a more direct call on
  the lost. Leaders must plead for insight as to how much to expect from a particular
  disciple. All believers need discernment as to Satan's next move. In all, there
  are thousands of decisions in ministry requiring divine guidance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Secondly, <b><i>God empowers our ministries</i></b>.
    Jesus' declaration that &quot;apart from me you can do nothing,&quot; is
    again a figure of speech. He doesn't mean we can do nothing at all, but that
    we can do nothing of spiritual value apart from him. As Christian leaders,
    we realize that we depend absolutely on God for things like:</font></p>
</dir></dir></dir>
<ul>
  <dir> <dir>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Times" size="+1"><b><i>Evangelism</i></b>. While a warm demeanor,
        patience, good arguments, and heartfelt pleas matter in evangelism, only
        the Holy Spirit can finally convict a person of their need for Christ
        and bring them to repentance. (John 6:65)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times" size="+1"><b><i>Conviction</i></b>. We can preach
        truth, but we depend on God to convict people's hearts to follow the
        truth. Apart from spiritual conviction, people will listen to the truth
        with passive curiosity. This is likely the power Paul referred to in
        1&nbsp;Cor. 4:19,20.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times" size="+1"><b><i>Development of Christian character</i></b>.
        No amount of blustering and Bible thumping will transform human lives, &quot;for
        it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for <i>His</i> good
        pleasure.&quot; (Philippians 2:13)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times" size="+1"><i><b>Overthrowing demons</b></i>. How could
        any human hope to impact a spiritual being like Satan apart from the
        power of God? (Rom. 16:20)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times" size="+1"><b><i>Filling Christian meetings with spiritual
            power</i></b>. Paul asks his friends to pray that he be &quot;given
            utterance&quot; when preaching. (Eph. 6:19) He knew that preaching
            must be anointed by the Holy Spirit in order to be effective.</font></li>
  </ul>
  </dir></dir>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">Failure to understand or believe in God's role in ministry
        will always have negative results. These results include arrogance during &quot;in
        season&quot; times, as well as panic, pushiness and discouragement during &quot;out
        of season&quot; times. On the other hand, reliance on God's role in ministry
        will promote thankful humility during &quot;in season&quot; times, and
        stable perseverance during &quot;out of season&quot; times. Those who
        depend on God's part have confidence in God's adequacy through us.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</ul>

<h2 align="left"><font size="+1"><b>II. The effect of a God-Centered Perspective
      on our Attitude</b></font></h2>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">Consider the likely effect that a proper outlook in the
        area of God's role will have in each of the following areas. On a three
        column grid, describe the outlook and actions of the human effort minister
        on the left, the God-centered minister in the middle, and the reason
        for the difference on the right.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<dir> <dir> <dir>
<p><font size="+1">A. Witnessing</font> 
<dir> <dir>
<p><font size="+1"><i>[possible answers are provided here, but not when the paper
      is handed out in class. The students come up with these points in discussion.]</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1. Less fear of rejection because we know they are not rejecting
    us, but God. Unlike the man-centered witnesser, we realize God must quicken
    people's hearts, and if they don't respond, there is nothing we can do about
    it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2. Less tendency to push because human or social pressure
    would not result in conversion anyway. The God-centered minister learns to
    wait on the power of God.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">3. More likely to use the Word. God-centered ministers know
    that God works through his word. While using the Bible with one who doesn't
    believe the Bible may seem absurd to the natural mind, God says his word &quot;will
    not return void.&quot;</font></p>
</dir></dir>
<p><font size="+1">B. Discipline</font> 
<dir> <dir>
<p><font size="+1">1. No fear of sin. Instead of reacting out of fear that sin
    will ruin our church, the God-centered minister has a settled confidence
    that Christ will build his church. We become free to discipline sin for the
    good of the sinner.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2. No doubting of God's ability to change lives. Man-centered
    ministers are tempted to become fatalistic about those in chronic sin, thinking &quot;they'll
    never change.&quot; The God-centered minister knows God's power is great.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">3. Less apt to try to force people. Again, human pressure
    is not an adequate motivation for permanent and real spiritual change. While
    the Bible does prescribe pressure in certain extreme situations, God-centered
    leaders are less prone to jumping to this conclusion.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">4. More patience. Human-based ministers lose patience because
    they are waiting on fallen humans to change, rather than waiting on God to
    bring change.</font></p>
</dir></dir>
<p><font size="+1">C. Teaching and preaching</font> 
<dir> <dir>
<p><font size="+1">1. More boldness and confidence. God-centered teachers and
    preachers know that God infuses our utterances with power, and that it is
    his will to bless the church. Instead of relying on self-confidence, which
    often withers, these rely on God-confidence which is reliable.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2. More tendency to pray against the Devil. The God-centered
    speaker knows that each talk is a spiritual battle that must be fought with
    the weapons of righteousness.</font></p>
</dir></dir>
<p><font size="+1">D. Discipleship</font> 
<dir> <dir>
<p><font size="+1">1. The God-centered discipler tries to get in line with what
    God wants to do with particular lives. They realize that God's gifting of
    individuals is an indication of his will for their lives.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2. More emphasis on discernment, and less on program. The
    key becomes recognizing what God is doing, rather than having the ultimate
    method that can't fail.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">3. More relaxation, leading to more trust from disciples.
    Since the God-centered minister sees himself as a facilitator of God's development
    of another's life, people sense that they aren't being made to follow the
    discipler's will, but that both are trying to follow God's will.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">4. More willingness to teach in-depth Bible study. Those who
    conceive of discipleship in sociological terms see little reason to waste
    large amounts of time learning God's word. They prefer to teach techniques
    and formulas and consider deep critical issues in Scripture a waste of time.
    The God-centered leader knows that people are sanctified through the word
    of God (see <a href="../papers/mogword.htm">The Word of God as a Means of
    Growth</a>)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">5. Less likelihood of bossing. God-centered disciplers know
    that convictions to follow the Lord must come from within disciples as they
    respond to the Holy Spirit. Change that results from external pressure would
    be pseudo-change.</font></p>
</dir></dir>
<p><font size="+1">E. Leadership</font> 
<dir> <dir>
<p><font size="+1">1. Easier to admit problems in the church. Unlike the human-based
    leader, who is ego involved with the well-being of the church, the God-centered
    ministry has no reason to avoid looking at bad news.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2. Easier to avoid pessimism. At the same time, God-centered
    leaders don't become negative, because they know God has the power to handle
    even severe problems.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">3. More inclination to raise up others-- less need to &quot;hog
    the ball.&quot; Human-centered leaders secretly think their own competence
    is the key to the success of the church. Since they interpret the growth
    of the church in terms of cause and effect on the natural level, it makes
    no sense to have a less-experienced, less competent new leader speak and
    lead. The result is a man-centered ministry, where the significant public
    roles are always filled by the great man.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">4. More time and effort devoted to prayer. The God-centered
    minister knows that only God can build the church, and that every advance
    requires his power.</font></p>
</dir></dir></dir></dir></dir>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="+1">Many more examples could be cited. This perspective affects
        every area of ministry. As in personal sanctification, learning to rely
        on God's power instead of our own power is a process which takes time.
        No leader can claim to have this area down completely.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">One of the main ways we learn to depend on God is by experiencing
        failure (see II Cor. 11:30-33; 12:9,10). As we respond properly to these
        failures, we gradually learn to minister in dependence upon God's power.
        (See the paper, <a href="failure.htm">Developing a Theology of Failure</a>)</font></p>

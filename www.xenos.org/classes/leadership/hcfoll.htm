<p><font size="+1"><b>I. Definition</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A. &quot;Follow-Up&quot; refers to the process of ongoing personal 
  investment and communication that should occur after a new person has begun 
  to attend home church or <a href="../../ministries/ct/ct.htm">Central Teaching</a>. 
  The goal of the Christian worker in this situation is to make available the 
  truths of Christianity in a way that is understandable, and that is suited to 
  the progress of the investigator. The Bible stresses the importance of &quot;persuading 
  men&quot; of the truth (II&nbsp;Cor 5:11) ; of &quot;feeding the sheep&quot; 
  -- (i.e. those newly born into His kingdom, Jn. 21:15-17); of fellowship (Acts 
  2:44-47); and of teaching (Acts 5:42). The final goal of follow-up can best 
  be stated in the words of the Bible, that the new person would become &quot;firmly 
  rooted, built up in Him and established in...faith&quot; (Col.2:6-7). At Xenos, 
  we keep track of how many first-time visitors to home churches remain on as 
  members. This ratio of first-timers to new members is our follow-up ratio.</font></p>
<font size="4"><b>
<p><font size="+1">II. Strategy</font></p>
</b></font> 
<p><font size="+1">A. The body of truth contained in the Bible is immense. It 
  would be a mistake to overwhelm an investigator with too much biblical content 
  at once. The truths of the Bible should be made available gradually so there 
  is a good likelihood they will be understood. Also, some people progress at 
  different rates than others. To determine the rate at which truths should be 
  introduced and explained use these criteria:</font> 
<ul>
  <p><font size="+1">1. The interest of the new person. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">2. The level of education of the new person.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">3. The response of the new person to what he/she has already 
    heard.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">4. The desire of the new person to hear more.</font></p>
</ul>
<p><font size="+1">B. There are also more important, and less important truths 
  to focus on at an early age in the Lord. For instance, complicated ethical issues 
  will probably not be as healthy to focus on as grace and the means of growth. 
  However, there is virtually no area of biblical truth that will not come up 
  in the course of conversations with new people. We have to be prepared to give 
  satisfying answers to these areas, without necessarily allowing them to become 
  the center of attention.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">C. Finally, all who investigate Christ have negatives related 
  to Christianity that must be overcome before they will be willing to come to 
  him. In the first place there are the negative images of Christianity people 
  have from offensive Christians and churches in their past. Perhaps even more 
  difficult to overcome are the moral issues they must deal with. As sinners, 
  we realize that surrender to Christ will mean major changes in our lifestyles. 
  In many cases, this accounts for why people are reluctant to come to God for 
  forgiveness. As the benefits of Christianity slowly dawn on new people (including 
  the warmth of body life, the offer of eternal life through grace, the possibility 
  of healing, the sane and comprehensive world-view offered in Christianity, etc.) 
  these may eventually outweigh the negatives, leading to a willingness to encounter 
  Christ. Even after receiving Christ, people may continue resisting God's work 
  in their lives in order to guard their right to sin, and avoid fears they have 
  of commitment.<br>
  <br>
  In our dialog with new people, we should watch for signs of this inner approach-avoidance 
  conflict, trying to prayerfully discern what God is doing in their hearts. We 
  need to become gracious advocates for God in this conflict, neither pushing 
  too hard, nor avoiding painful questions too long. We should avoid pushing for 
  commitment from those who haven't begun to experience the love of God.</font></p>
<font size="4">
<p><b><font size="+1">III. Context</font></b></p>
</font>
<p><font size="+1">A. Since follow-up is communication, it will be facilitated 
  by good relationship with the new person. People not only need understanding, 
  they need trust. Also, part of the message we want to communicate is subjective 
  in nature-- that is, the love of Christ, as experienced in the local church. 
  For all of these reasons, it is desirable to do our communicating in the context 
  of developing social relationships if possible. </font>
<ul>
  <p><font size="+1">1. We should welcome a new person with a personal invitation 
    to return for more study and fellowship.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">2. Social involvement outside of home church often provides 
    an opportunity to discuss spiritual things in a comfortable and natural setting. 
    In addition, it shows the person that Christians know how to have a good time.</font></p>
</ul>
<p><font size="+1">B. Types of social involvement. </font>
<ul>
  <p><font size="+1">1. Suit the type of social activity to the new person. Young 
    singles like one kind of social experience, while married couples (especially 
    with kids) like different kinds of activities.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">2. Try to make time for personal interaction and discussion 
    sometime during your social time. Experiences that are totally diffuse (e.g. 
    fun, but incompatible with serious communication, like watching a movie) are 
    not as good as those with a mixture of diffuse and relational activities. 
    This follows from the fact that we will find it more difficult to express 
    either the love of Christ or the content of the Bible effectively in diffuse 
    settings.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">3. While social time and friendship are legitimate components 
    in follow-up, we should avoid the cultic practice of &quot;love-bombing.&quot; 
    How would you distinguish between legitimate friendship building and &quot;love-bombing&quot;?</font></p>
</ul>
<font size="4">
<p><b><font size="+1">IV. Taking Responsibility</font></b></p>
</font>
<p><font size="+1">A. Committed Christians, such as leaders and responsible workers, 
  should take the initiative to follow-up each new person. Older Christians are 
  often helpful in follow-up because of their knowledge of the Word and their 
  experience. At the same time, younger believers can get involved, especially 
  if the new person is a friend of theirs. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">B. As believers grow, the question of personal mentoring, or 
  discipleship comes up. Again, the one who brings a guest is the first choice 
  for discipler. In cases, where this is not possible, another should be given 
  this assignment, perhaps along with the bringer. In other words, an older believer 
  may come in alongside the younger believer to help mentor the person. See the 
  paper <a href="hcmang.html">Managing Home Church Growth</a> for guidelines on 
  making this decision.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"></font>C<font size="+1">. Initial follow-up can be done by 
  anyone who happens to meet a new person in a meeting. However, continuing, or 
  in-depth follow-up is most effective when done through the existing ministry 
  spheres in the home church. Let the person who brought the guest, and his or 
  her immediate circle of friends do the follow up. Focusing on those within a 
  given sphere will prevent the new person from being &quot;ganged up&quot; on 
  by several zealous workers, or completely neglected.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">C. Life Situation </font>
<ul>
  <p><font size="+1">1. Good follow-up involves being sensitive to the life situation 
    of the new person. While some new people may be single and lonely with time 
    on their hands, Others may be a single parents holding down a full time job. 
    Some new people may have no previous exposure to Christianity, while others 
    may come from a strong church background. Occasionally, a new person may even 
    have more important physical needs which require attention before effective 
    follow-up can take place.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">2. Whatever their life situation may be, we should consider 
    these factors individually when thinking about how to follow up with a new 
    person. Since follow-up is a ministry that often includes relationships, consider 
    who can most effectively relate to guests and their life situations. At times, 
    this may even involve suggesting a home church which is more suited for the 
    person's needs.</font></p>
</ul>
<p><font size="+1">D. Friendships and Ministry Spheres</font> 
<ul>
  <p><font size="+1">1. New people often come into the home church already having 
    a friendship with the person who brought them. This person has the best opportunity 
    to follow-up the guest he or she brought.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">2. In a case where the one bringing a new person is not spiritually 
    mature or experienced in this type of ministry, leaders should take the responsibility 
    to assure that an experienced believer from the same ministry sphere helps 
    the younger believer. Avoid arrangements that will lead to guests ending up 
    in a cell group different from the one who brought them (unless, of course, 
    they are of the opposite sex).</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">3. If the new person does not have a relationship with the 
    person who brought them or if they are of the opposite sex, then again, the 
    leaders should take responsibility to assure that someone takes responsibility 
    for follow-up.</font></p>
</ul>
<font size="4">
<p><b><font size="+1">V. Discipleship</font></b></p>
</font>
<p><font size="+1">A. If a new person expresses genuine interest, you should offer 
  them an opportunity to attend cell group on a trial basis. Remember that those 
  attending on a trial basis cannot be expected to have the same level of commitment 
  as the other members. Some older home churches are finding that the term &quot;cell 
  group&quot; is undesirable for communication purposes. In these situations, 
  straight forward descriptive terms like &quot;small men's Bible study&quot; 
  or &quot;fellowship group&quot; are preferable.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">B. Dissonance is not uncommon in the first few months of spiritual 
  growth. Young believers should be warned ahead of time, and taught the biblical 
  perspective on trials (James 1:2-5; Acts 14:22).</font></p>

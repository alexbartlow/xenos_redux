  <p><font size="+1" color="#FFFFA4"><i>[This paper was originally developed as 
    the basis for the 1999 Servant Team Retreat, and adapted for leadership class. 
    The audience for the paper (like those in the leadership class) were older 
    Christians who were relatively well-trained and familiar with the Xenos courses 
    and materials referred to throughout the paper.]</i></font></p>

<h3><font size="+1" color="#FFFFA4">Definition</font></h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1" color="#FFFFA4">As a leadership, we settled on the following 
    definition of personal discipleship as it applies in Xenos Christian Fellowship 
    </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1" color="#FFFFA4">A discipler is one who helps people attain 
      servant team status by both ministering in a general way in the church, 
      and by holding specific meetings for study, coaching, counseling, and prayer, 
      all in the context of a close personal relationship. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1" color="#FFFFA4">Discipleship usually begins in the context 
    of the home church and cell group. Numerous members may contribute to the 
    process at this level. Body life is a major contributor to the discipleship 
    task. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1" color="#FFFFA4">Below we have described what we see as the 
    nine main areas of learning and growth every disciple needs in order to be 
    complete and mature. For each area of learning, we have described specific 
    skills, attitudes, and competencies the disciple needs to acquire in the course 
    of the discipling process. Under each major heading are several resources 
    you can use to get started. The Perils and Rewards sections are for your use 
    in motivating disciples. By pointing these things out, you may create more 
    interest in pushing forward. The communication ideas are specific ideas for 
    ways you can teach that particular area. We also have a simple version of 
    this outline arranged with headings only in a <a href="DiscipleshipGoals.htm">one-page 
    worksheet</a>.</font></p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1" color="#FFFFA4">Scripture: 1 Cor 3:6,7; 2 Cor 3:5; Col 
      1:29; Jn 6:44; Mark 4:26-29 </font></p>
    <h4><font size="+1" color="#FFFFA4">Perils and Rewards</font></h4>
    <p><font size="+1" color="#FFFFA4">- Man-centered ministers tend to be hyper-controlling 
      since they try to do the impossible--that which only God can do. They are 
      prone to burnout due to failure.<br />
      - The work of man-centered ministers</font><font size="+1" color="#FFFFA4"> 
      does not have a lasting influence in the person's life because it is the 
      product of human manipulation rather than divine transformation.<br />
      Rewards <br />
      - Allowing God to do His part brings rewards, which would include the joy 
      of seeing God at work. Depending on Him will also increase fellowship with 
      Him through the shared interaction and collective effort.<br />
      - By allowing God to do His part, ministers will develop greater patience 
      in their own life, have far greater impact in the life of their disciples, 
      and have greater fruitfulness in the church. </font></p>
    <h4><font size="+1" color="#FFFFA4">Communication:</font></h4>
    <p><font size="+1" color="#FFFFA4">- The key is to show them how to pray before 
      ministry events and let them see that you depend on God and expect Him to 
      work in people's lives.<br />
      - As God accomplishes His purpose within the life of the individual, the 
      minister needs to give credit where credit is due by modeling humility, 
      joy and contentment with the role they played.<br />
      - Point out specific cases where God is obviously at work in the individual.<br />
      - Leaders should point out to their disciples their tendency to control 
      others instead of expecting God's conviction and leading.<br />
      - Go through the paper <a href="godmin.html" target="_self">God's Part 
      in Ministry</a> and discuss the questions specific to their tendencies.<br />
      - Have your disciples study the section on ministry under law in <a
    href="../../books/wiv.htm" target="_top"><i>Walking In Victory</i> </a>as 
      a way to introduce these principles. </font></p>

<h3><font size="+1" color="#FFFFA4">Has developed reasonable ethical priorities,

      versus &quot;fundy&quot; sin (external sin) issues, may suffer an unfulfilling 
      life because they don't attain progress in crucial areas like loving 
      others and being honest. Instead they may devote most of their attention 
      to things like having a clean language.<br />
      - They often live double lives, as they seem spiritual on the outside, yet 
      they are practicing secret sin, which entangles them.<br />
      - They tend to be rigid in their relationships with others, which stifles 
      their ability to grow in intimacy with people. They also tend to be lonely 
      because people do not want to be judged in such minor areas.<br />
      - By focusing on areas God considers important the rewards include the joy 
      of seeing their lives aligned with God's will. <br />
      - The disciple will also see freedom from petty rules, leading to enhanced 
      cultural relevance and no misdirection of effort in reaching others for 
      the kingdom of God. </font></p>
    <h4><font size="+1" color="#FFFFA4">Communication: </font></h4>
    <p><font size="+1" color="#FFFFA4">- Teach scripture and emphasize God's priorities<br />
      - They can use vicarious learning through negative examples. Point out how 
      nomistic fundamentalism fails.<br />
      - Teach them to refuse to submit to petty rules in their own life when confronted 
      by others.<br />
      - Counsel them through marriage and relational problems that result from 
      their focus on the externals. This will help them see the issues to prioritize.</font></p>

      - The inability to love maturely will also destroy fellowship and the witness 
      of the body toward non-Christians. <br />
      - A proper view allows the discipler and disciple to receive correction

      to God. Teaching and modeling verbal affirmations of another's prayer

          argue that if people were honest, we would all admit our weakness and

          loose demeanor without going to excess of sin. Teach disciples to explicitly

          observations. Learn to stress our freedom in Christ. <br />

          hypocrisy, rejecting the idea that it is hypocrisy for a Christian to 
          sin. Demonstrate authenticity. Join non Christian in rejecting the hypocrisy 
          of the church, and of church history<br />

          view to current events<br />
          - <b>Bitter and nasty</b>: Disciples must learn to project humility 
          and kindness - a welcoming spirit and a forgiving spirit (Phil. 4:5) 
          They should distance themselves from known mean Christians. They should 
          not engage non Christians in ethical debate<br />
          - <b>Ignorant</b>: Our disciples will not overcome this view unless 
          they are not ignorant. Encourage them to get educated.<br />
          - <b>Intolerant</b>: Teach disciples to look for common ground where 
          they can be accepting. Teach them not to be looking for opportunities 
          to argue and condemn. Teach them how to disagree without seeming self-righteous. 
          Teach them to share their own weaknesses, limitations, and lack of omniscience.

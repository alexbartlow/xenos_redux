  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Following is a partial list of books I like with brief descriptions. All
    of them are available through Christian bookstores (although you may have to order them),
    or the Xenos Study Center(if you live in Columbus). This is only a partial list because
    there are several more sections we would like to add in the near future, as well as expand
    the current sections. Stay tuned for updates.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Wingdings">&amp;</font> - Start with these. It would be good to have all entry
    level books (<font face="Wingdings">&amp;</font> ) read within the first two or three
    years of your Christian life.</p>
    <p><font face="Wingdings">&amp;</font> <font face="Wingdings">&amp;</font> - Intermediate
    level. It's not that these books are hard to understand or read. The entry level books set
    a framework for going further. These intermediate books are good for those who are
    committed to Christian ministry and deeper sanctification.</p>
    <p><font face="Wingdings">&amp;</font> <font face="Wingdings">&amp;</font> <font face="Wingdings">&amp;</font> - Don't shy away from these books, even though some of them
    will require some effort. If you want to get serious about studying the Bible, learning
    theology, being able to teach, etc., these books will really help.</p>

      <p><a name="Spiritual_growth"><b>Spiritual Growth</b></a></p>
      <p><font face="Times"><i>Call to Discipleship</i></font><font face="Wingdings"><b>&amp;</b></font><font face="Times"> by Juan Ortiz with Jamie Buckingham (Logos; Also goes by the name <i>Disciple</i>)</font></p>
      <p>A very challenging call to commitment from a South American preacher. Ortiz fills the
      book with colorful and humorous illustrations while writing with serious conviction. Good
      for younger or older Christians.</p>
      <p><font face="Times"><i>Celebration of Discipline</i></font><font face="Wingdings"><b>&amp;&amp;</b></font><font face="Times"> by Richard Foster (Harper and Row)</font></p>
      <p>Foster shows that God has prescribed a number of disciplines that are the key to our
      growth. He compare spiritual disciplines to disciplines in any field, showing that
      discipline is God's way. A very good book to challenge our passivity. Also helpful in our
      prayer life.</p>
      <p><font face="Times"><i>Changed into His Likeness</i></font><font face="Wingdings"><b>&amp;&amp;</b></font><font face="Times"> by Watchman Nee (Christian Literature Crusade / Tyndale).</font></p>
      <p>Nee studies three OT characters to show how God changes people. Great insight and
      convicting reading. Good for a Christian of any age.</p>
      <p><font face="Times"><i>Decision Making and the Will of God</i></font><font face="Wingdings"><b>&amp;&amp;</b></font><font face="Times"> by Gary Freison (Multnomah).</font></p>
      <p>Even though this is an issue-oriented book, it is important for spiritual growth
      because discerning God's will is a big part of learning to follow him. Frieson argues with
      what he calls the &quot;traditional view&quot; of following various &quot;road signs&quot;
      to discover God's will. Fascinating and challenging reading, full of scripture study.</p>
      <p><font face="Times"><i>Desiring God</i>,</font><font face="Wingdings"><b>&amp;&amp;</b></font><font face="Times"> John Piper</font></p>
      <p>Most Christians struggle with Paul's command to &quot;Rejoice in the Lord <i>always.</i>&quot;
      Commonly we forget that God is the single happiest and contented person in the universe.
      We tend to think that He is disappointed with us or that His demands are burdensome. Piper
      explores the Scriptures to come up with some surprising conclusions. Provocative reading
      because of the way he approaches things.</p>
      <p><font face="Times"><i>Disappointment with God</i></font><font face="Wingdings"><b>&amp;&amp;</b></font><font face="Times"> by Philip Yancey (Zondervan)</font></p>
      <p>Yancey shows how our expectations of God are disappointed, and then we have a typical
      &quot;Job reaction.&quot; His discussion of how to come to terms with God's love is very
      convicting, especially if you have been through some trials and disappointments.</p>
      <p><font face="Times"><i>Finding God</i></font><font face="Wingdings"><b>&amp;&amp;</b></font><font face="Times"> by Larry Crabb (Zondervan).</font></p>
      <p>A look at some of the deeper attitudes and problems we face as we grow as Christians
      and try to get closer to God. Barriers come up from our own expectations and our
      sinfulness. This is a book for Christians who have been through some suffering or
      frustration in their sanctification.</p>
      <p><font face="Times"><i>Five Views on Sanctification</i></font><font face="Wingdings"><b>&amp;&amp;&amp;</b></font><font face="Times"> by Deiter, Hoekema, Horton, McQuilken and Walvoord (Zondervan; Academie
      Books).</font></p>
      <p>A more scholarly discussion of sanctification from 5 different theological traditions;
      the Wesleyan, Reformed, Pentecostal, Keswick and Augustinian-Dispensational view.
      Excellent reading for someone who is at the stage of studying more seriously.</p>
      <p><font face="Times"><i>Honest to God? Becoming an Authentic Christian</i></font><font face="Wingdings"><b>&amp;</b></font><font face="Times"> by Bill Hybels (Zondervan)</font></p>
      <p>Hybels challenges us to be consistent with our Christianity, in the family, in the work
      place, in our attitudes and prayers. He offers typical signs of inconsistency and
      practical advice on how to sincerely follow God. Good conviction for Christians of any
      age.</p>
      <p><font face="Times"><i>In Pursuit of Maturity</i></font><font face="Wingdings"><b>&amp;&amp;</b></font><font face="Times"> by J. Oswald Sanders (Zondervan)</font></p>

      <p>A classic work on the challenge of getting to know God. Packer makes a case that this

      <p><font face="Times"><i>Knowledge of the Holy</i></font><font face="Wingdings"><b>&amp;</b></font><font face="Times"> by A.W. Tozier </font></p>
      <p>A classic work on getting to know God, some of the barriers and benefits. Very
      convicting words about how we pursue the things of God rather than God himself. Good for a
      study group or a new Christian.</p>
      <p><font face="Times"><i>Love Not the World</i></font><font face="Wingdings"><b>&amp;</b></font><font face="Times">, Watchman Nee</font></p>

      <p>Nee focuses on the need for brokenness in serving God. By brokeness Nee means a lack of
      confidence in our &quot;outer man&quot; (emotions, intellect, will, etc.), and a greater

      <p>Although this book is also about authority and leadership in the church, much of it
      centers on our personal problem with rebellion. Authority is at the heart of God's work
      with us, and Nee demonstrates this with many interesting and convicting stories in the
      Bible. The second half of the book is an excellent exhortation to those who want to be
      leaders in the church. We have no authority in ourselves. This book is a must-read for
      anyone who wants to be a leader or worker because it shows the humility we need to have.</p>

      <p>This book is a defense of the biblical teaching on salvation that says simply believing
      or trusting in Christ's death for us is the key to salvation. Hodges has written this book
      in response to John MacArthur's <i>The Gospel According to Jesus</i>, which argues that
      salvation also requires us to submit to the authority of Jesus Christ and commit ourselves
      to follow him (sometimes referred to as &quot;Lordship Theology&quot;).</p>
      <p><font face="Times"><i>Basic Christianity</i></font><font face="Wingdings"><b>&amp;</b></font><font face="Times"> by John Stott (IVP)</font></p>

      or older.</p>

      the Bible, etc., and needs a foundation (275 pages).</p>

      <p>Predestination? Human freedom? What do the Scriptures say about these issues? A look at
      Romans 9 (which talks about God's Sovereignty in very startling terms), Ephesians&nbsp;1,
      and other passages relating to the issue of predestination. The book argues against
      predestination in personal salvation. One of the best scriptural treatments on the issue
      from the non-Calvinist perspective.</p>

      <p>For a more in-depth look at the cross and what exactly happens when we turn to Christ,
      this is a well written, informative work. For under 200 pages it covers a lot. Murray

      if you think you've heard enough about the cross, this book will fascinate you with it's
      insight into the biblical pictures of the atonement and some of the arguments that swirl
      around this issue.</p>

      Noble Exercise&quot;, &quot;Talking to God for Men&quot;, and &quot;The Secret of
      Power&quot; this book motivates and educates on the least understood and most neglected
      aspects of our relationship with God. </p>
      <p><font face="Times"><i>Spiritual Leadership</i>,</font><font face="Wingdings"><b>&amp;&amp;</b></font><font face="Times"> Oswald Sanders</font></p>
      <p>Sanders was a world class leader and trainer of Christians. In this book he covers a
      set of &quot;principles of leadership&quot; that are timeless. Using the Bible and
      practical experience he expounds on such topics as: &quot;The Leader and His
      Reading&quot;, &quot;The Leader and His Time&quot;, and &quot;The Cost of Being a
      Leader.&quot; Great for anyone who wants to about serving God, not just for leaders.</p>
      <p><font face="Times"><i>The Character of God's Workman</i>,</font><font face="Wingdings"><b>&amp;&amp;</b></font><font face="Times"> Watchman Nee</font></p>
      <p>This book was derived from a series that Nee on being a Christian worker
      (2&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;2:15). He covers ten or so topics including: money, slothfulness, the
      Word, and prayer. Nee, as usual, is very challenging. Can be used in a study group or
      personal study.</p>
      <p><font face="Times"><i>The Dynamics of Personal Follow-up</i>,</font><font face="Wingdings"><b>&amp;&amp;</b></font><font face="Times"> Gary Kuhne</font></p>
      <p>A book born from the conviction that most new people in a church never get the
      personal, loving attention they need in order to learn the basics of the Christian faith
      and make the decisions to trust God with their lives. Read this book to see how follow-up
      work is done.</p>
      <p><font face="Times"><i>The Lost Art of Discipleship</i>,</font><font face="Wingdings"><b>&amp;&amp;</b></font><font face="Times"> Leroy Eims</font></p>
      <p>Eims, the former president of the Navigators, teaches a step-by-step method on how to
      raise people from Christian infancy to Christian worker to Christian leader. Eims uses a
      wealth of personal experience to illustrate how you can be used to shape others' lives for
      Christ. Good for helping establish a vision for the value of discipleship.</p>
      <p><font face="Times"><i>The Master Plan of Evangelism</i>,</font><font face="Wingdings"><b>&amp;&amp;</b></font><font face="Times"> Coleman</font></p>
      <p>A classic on the topic of discipleship, more than the issue of evangelism. This book
      looks at the strategies Jesus employed to train the Disciples. A must-read for anyone
      planning to get involved in ministry.</p>
      <p><font face="Times"><i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>,</font><font face="Wingdings"><b>&amp;&amp;</b></font><font face="Times"> John Bunyan</font></p>
      <p>Classic, Classic, Classic. Written a few hundred years ago, it remains a top seller
      today. Bunyan tells the story of a man named Christian and his journey to the Celestial
      City. Along the way he runs into such characters as Worldly Wiseman, Ignorance, and Hope
      with whom he dialogues. The many challenges that beset Christian, such as the Bog of
      Despair and trying to climb Mount Sinai, provide relevance and perspective on the
      Christian walk.</p>
      <p><font face="Times"><i>The Release of the Spirit</i>,</font><font face="Wingdings"><b>&amp;&amp;</b></font><font face="Times"> Watchman Nee</font></p>
      <p>Nee states that God cannot use you in this world until you are broken of your own will
      and strength. Much like Paul in 2 Cor.&nbsp;12, Nee tells us how God's strength is
      perfected in weakness, and he shows how the Holy Spirit can use us in powerful and
      supernatural ways. This book is very challenging to Christian workers, especially if they
      are going through hard times.</p>
      <p><font face="Times"><i>The Summons</i>,</font><font face="Wingdings"><b>&amp;</b></font><font face="Times"> Dennis McCallum</font></p>
      <p>A modern novel about a college Bible study that finds itself in the middle of God's
      plan for their campus. Sheri, the main character, asks common questions non Christians
      ask, giving great material to the reader. This book will encourage the worker in student
      ministries because it shows spiritual work from God's perspective.</p>
      <p><font face="Times"><i>Too Busy Not To Pray</i>,</font><font face="Wingdings"><b>&amp;&amp;</b></font><font face="Times"> Hybels</font></p>
      <p>This is a great modern book on prayer. Hybels, an obviously effective Christian worker,
      found that without prayer his life was dry and ineffective. He gives the reader some
      practical advice on &quot;slowing down from 50,000 rpm to 5,000 rpm&quot; where you can
      begin to hear the Spirit of the Lord and not just ask for things.</p>
      <p><font face="Times"><i>Understanding People</i>,</font><font face="Wingdings"><b>&amp;&amp;</b></font><font face="Times"> Larry Crabb</font></p>
      <p>Crabb's most thorough book describing his view of human nature, sin, spiritual and
      emotional growth. Great for stimulating thought or study on the nature of sanctification.
      Goes way beyond a book about counseling. </p>

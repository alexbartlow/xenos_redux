      <p>The    authoritarian head of the pantheon was El, but the chief executive, the king,    was the personified Storm, Hadad, the Baal or Lord    of the gods and men. Complementary    powers were paired as male and female...    18</p>
    <p>Man&rsquo;s    creation was conceived and executed not as an end in itself or as a natural    sequel to the formation of the rest of the universe but rather as an    expedient to satisfy a group of discontented gods. Man was made to be the servant of the gods,    to be a kind of breadwinner of his divine masters and to be the builder and    caretaker of their sanctuaries. -- Alexander Heidel, <em>The Babylonian Genesis, </em>120</p></td>

      <p>The    God of Israel has no mythology. 26... He transcended nature&mdash;and transcended,    likewise, the realm of mythopoetic thought... No    abstract words were needed to describe God&rsquo;s being: it was sufficient to    identify him with a simple historical statement: he was the God who brought    Israel out of the land of Egypt (Ex. 20:2). 20,21</p>

      <p>[The    polytheist] did not distinguish between reality and the force in or behind    it. In the storm he meets the God    Storm. Nature is alive, and its powers    are distinguished as personal because man has directly experienced them. There is no such thing as the inanimate. 17</p>

    <td width="358" valign="top"><p style="text-align:center;"><em>God described in relational terms</em><em></em></p>
    <p>The    Israelite language in depicting the divine is almost solely drawn from the    categories of personality and society; indeed this is the basic language of    the Bible and of the Jewish and Christian religion. 26 (see Deut. 10:14,15) </p></td>

<p><em>Concept of &ldquo;holy&rdquo;</em><em></em></p>
<ul>
  <li>singularly  unique, other, separate (Ex. 15:11; Is. 40:25, 44:7,8; Micah 7:18)
    <ul>
      <li>perfect (<em>tamim</em>)&mdash;his works (Deut  32:4), his way (2 Sam. 22:31), his word  (Ps. 19:7)</li>
      <li>unchanging, constant (Malachi 3:6-<em>promises</em>; Micah 7:18,20-<em>love</em>)</li>
      <li>reveals what we are not&mdash;producing <em>fear</em> and <em>awe&mdash;</em>associated with fire</li>
    </ul>

<p><em>Majesty (hadar)</em><em></em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Greatness  (Ps. 48:1; 77:13; 86:10-13; 92:5; 95:3)
    <ul>
      <li>exalted ruler &amp;  possessor (Isaiah 40; Psalms 93:1,2; 145:5; Hebrews 1:3)</li>
      <li>sovereign &ldquo;King of kings,  Lord of lords&rdquo; (Deut. 10:17)</li>
      <li>limitless (Ps 139...; Is. 40:28)&mdash;in  wisdom and power</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Reflection on God&rsquo;s majesty</em><em></em></p>
<p>In our  democratic, individualistic, self-reliant age, it is difficult to conceive of  God being the exalted sovereign, worthy of all and owner of all. But God&rsquo;s majesty also offers a challenge in  a different direction. Packer writes,</p>
<p>He never abandons anyone on whom he has set  his love; nor does Christ, the good shepherd, ever lose track of his  sheep. It is as false as it is  irreverent to accuse God of forgetting, or overlooking, or losing interest in,  the state and needs of his own people.  If you have been resigning yourself to the thought that God has left you  high and dry, seek grace to be ashamed of yourself. Such unbelieving pessimism deeply dishonors  our great God and savior.  J.I.  Packer, <em>Knowing God</em>, 88,89</p>
<p>1. How might a diminished view of God&rsquo;s  greatness be in the way of  knowing Him more deeply?</p>
<p>2. How might a robust view of God&rsquo;s greatness  have transforming impact  on my life?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&ldquo;<u>Show me your glory</u>&rdquo;<u></u></strong></p>
<p><em>Exodus 33:18-23; 34:6-8 the glory of  the Lord revealed</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>God&rsquo;s  glory (<em>kabod</em>,  honor) is his goodness (33:19)
    <ul>
      <li> God&rsquo;s <em>character</em> is the foundation of goodness and his <em>will</em> is directed by it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Justice</em> and <em>righteousness</em> emerge out of God&rsquo;s goodness
    <ul>
      <li>All polytheisms tend to be religions  of the <em>status quo</em>, and none of them  has ever produced a thoroughgoing social revolution based upon the high concept  of social justice... The prophetic protest against social injustice is without  close parallel in the ancient world, and it was a protest grounded in a known  law which the powerful were able to subvert by means of legal techniques. The  justice and righteousness of God, therefore, were seen to be especially  solicitous of the weak. --G.E. Wright, <em>The Old Testament Against Its Environment</em>, 45,60</li>
      <li>Humans as God&rsquo;s  image-bearers and the uniqueness of the Law</li>
      <li>See Isaiah 57:15; Psalm 107:1-16
        <ul>
          <li>How  is God&rsquo;s goodness manifested?</li>
          <li>What  is the appropriate response to God&rsquo;s goodness?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Exodus 34:6,7&mdash;Central  biblical text on the essential nature of God</em>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>&quot;Yahweh,  Yahweh Elohim, </strong><strong>Compassionate  and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in loving-kindness and truth; who  keeps loving-kindness for thousands, who forgives iniquity, transgression and  sin; </strong><strong>Yet  he will by no means leave the guilty unpunished, visiting the iniquity of the  fathers on the children</strong><strong> </strong><strong>and on the grandchildren to the third and  fourth generations.</strong>&quot;</li>
      <li>The  essential nature of God is <em>relational</em>
        <ul>
  <li>The bricks we  collect in order to construct the biblical image of God are, as a rule,  conceptual notions, such as goodness, justice, wisdom, unity. In terms of frequency of usage in biblical  language, they are surpassed by statements referring to God&rsquo;s <em>pathos</em>, which, however, for a variety of  reasons, has never been accorded proper recognition in the history of biblical  theology... <em>Pathos</em> denotes, not an  idea of goodness, by a living care, a dynamic relation between God and man... --Abraham Heschel, <em>The Prophets</em>, 286, 289</li>
  <li>Key <em>contrasts: </em>mercy  and judgment (see Romans 11:22)</li>
  <li>Key <em>modifiers:</em>
    <ul>
      <li>&ldquo;slow&rdquo;&mdash;how  does God move in judgment?</li>
      <li> &quot;abounding&rdquo;&mdash;extent  of God&rsquo;s love, kindness, mercy, compassion</li>

          <li><em>hesed</em> and <em>&lsquo;emet</em>: faithful and true or merciful and true  (32x).</li>
          <li> <em>mishpat</em> (just) and <em>tsadaq</em> (righteous) and <em>hesed</em> (faithful or merciful)
            <ul>
              <li>See Ps. 33:4,5; 143:1,2; Jer. 9:24;  Isaiah 30: 1,2,18; Hos. 6:6; Matt. 23:23.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><em>hesed</em> is <em>everlasting</em>. Psalm 136:1-26 (50x)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Mercy &amp; compassion:  because of God&rsquo;s hesed, his righteousness is our  salvation</em> (Is. 56:1).
    <ul>
      <li>The Old Testament is the  story of God pursuing alienated and rebellious humanity </li>
      <li>History  is the victory of God&rsquo;s<em> hesed</em> in his plan to redeem all humanity (Isaiah  43:1-4a; 19:19ff).
        <ul>
          <li>&ldquo;The  prophets never taught that God and history are one, or that whatever happens  below reflects the will of God above.  Their vision is of man defying God, and God seeking man to reconcile  with him... Had the prophets relied on  human resources for justice and righteousness, on man&rsquo;s ability to fulfill all  of God&rsquo;s demands, on man&rsquo;s power to achieve redemption, they would not have  insisted upon the promise of messianic redemption, for messianism  implies that any course of living, even the supreme efforts of man by himself,  must fail in redeeming the world. In  other words, human history is not sufficient in itself. &rdquo;   --Abraham Heschel, <em>The Prophets</em> 2:214, 235</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Man&rsquo;s  predicament is a predicament for God (Psalm 49:7-9;15).
        <ul>
          <li>&ldquo;God  is concerned about the world, and shares in its fate. Indeed, this is the essence of God&rsquo;s moral  nature: His willingness to be intimately involved in the history of man.   Abraham Heschel <em>The Prophets</em>, 2:291</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>So,  willing to be intimately involved in man&rsquo;s predicament, God is willing also to  suffer with and for man.
        <ul>
          <li>&ldquo;[Man  is relevant to God]. To the biblical  mind the denial of man&rsquo;s relevance to God is as inconceivable as the denial of  God&rsquo;s relevance to man. This principle  leads to the basic affirmation of God&rsquo;s participation in human history, to the  certainty that the events in the world concern Him and arouse His  reaction. It finds its deepest  expression in the fact that God can actually suffer.&rdquo; Abraham Heschel,  The Prophets, 2:333,334 </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The  &ldquo;adultery&rdquo; theme in the prophets is directed toward the broken heart of God in  the face of human idolatry&mdash;forsaking the Lord:  Hosea 1:2; 2:5-8      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>&ldquo;Abounding in hesed&rdquo;</em>
    <ul>
      <li>God&rsquo;s  amazing generosity: Generosity means a  disposition to give to others in a way which has no mercenary motive and is not  limited by what the recipients deserve but consistently goes beyond it... Generosity is, so to speak, the focal point  of God&rsquo;s moral perfection; it is the quality which determines how all God&rsquo;s other  excellences are to be displayed... God overflows with generosity. --J.I. Packer, <em>Knowing God</em>, 162</li>
      <li>Is  God holding back his blessings from you?</li>
      <li>Do  you think that God desires to give you all good things <em>for no other reason </em>than that you are his child and he delights in  you?
        <ul>
          <li>You are precious in  My sight, You are honored and  I love you. --Isaiah 43:4          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Hesed of God and the prophetic voice</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>To  speak for God, it is crucial to experience the world <em>as</em> he does. 
    <ul>
      <li>&ldquo;Our conviction as  to [the prophets&rsquo;] existence is based on directly experienced fellowship with  God. To the prophet, knowledge of God  was fellowship with him, not attained by syllogism, analysis, or induction, but  by living together... The prophets  witness the misery that man endures as well as man&rsquo;s wickedness that God  endures. But God is wrestling with man&rdquo;  (and so is his prophet). Abraham  Heschel, <em>The  Prophets</em> 287,288,243 </li>
      <li>Knowing  God means sharing in the heart of God (see Jer. 20:9; Hos. 1:2; 1 Kgs. 17:21-24; Matt. 9:35-38; 2 Cor. 5:11). Like Jonah (4:2) it is possible to have true  knowledge of God (<em>de dicto</em>),  without actually having your heart shaped by personal knowledge of him (<em>de se</em>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> God&rsquo;s  heart and Christian leadership:
    <ul>
      <li>Sharing  God&rsquo;s <em>hesed</em> is the basis for Christian community (note carefully Col. 3:12,13)
        <ul>
          <li>Stirred  by the real of danger lost people (Acts 20:18-21) </li>
          <li>People  carved into the heart of a servant (2 Cor. 3:1-3; cf  Isaiah 49:16) </li>
          <li>Controlled  by the faithful love of God (2 Cor. 5:14) </li>
          <li>Fond  affection (1 Thess. 1:8) </li>
          <li>Wrestling  in prayer and with the word to influence people (Col. 1:9-12; 1 Tim. 4:14-16) </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Assignment:</strong></p>
<p> Read John Wenham, &ldquo;The Abominations  of the Heathen&rdquo; (from <em>The Goodness of   God</em>). This will provide some context for discussing  God&rsquo;s  judgment in week #3</p>
<p> Read J.I. Packer, &ldquo;The Wrath of God&rdquo;  (from <em>Knowing God</em>)</p>
<p> Respond  to the objection, &ldquo;I simply can not believe that God  is all loving and merciful since he is also full of wrath!&rdquo; What would you say about a God <em>without</em> wrath? How is wrath reconciled with mercy and love?  (keep your response to within a page&mdash;or 3-4 minute response)</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Week One: <em>Foundations of Old Testament Theology</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><u>The God Who Speaks</u></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong><em>Language and revelation</em></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The  Bible is the record of God communicating to humans through <em>words</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p>There  is no more common phrase in the Old Testament than, &ldquo;And God said...&rdquo;<strong></strong></p>
<h4>With language God creates the world; through language He reveals His  design in history to men. There is a  supreme confidence in an ultimate coherence of meaning through language that  informs the biblical vision.  Robert Alter, <em>The  Art of Biblical Narrative</em></h4>
<ul>
  <li><u>God&rsquo;s  word in creation</u>. All that exists flows from the creative power  of God&rsquo;s word. The Bible begins with the  dramatic pronouncement, &ldquo;God said... and it was... and it was good&rdquo; (Gen.  1:3&mdash;31). So <em>life itself reflects the ordered, rational structure of language</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p>One can think of  DNA as an instructional script, a software program, sitting in the nucleus of  the cell. Its decoding language has only  four letters in its alphabet (A,C,T,G).  A particular instruction, a gene, is made up of hundreds or thousands of  letters of code&hellip; All of the elaborate  functions of the cell, even in as complex an organism as ourselves, have to be  directed by the order of the letters in this script. Investigations of many  organisms, from bacteria to humans, reveal that this genetic code, by which  information is translated into protein, is universal in all known organisms. No  tower of Babel was to be allowed in the language of life. </p>
<p><strong> </strong>Francis Collins, <em>The Language of God</em></p>
<p>Many biologists  have capitalized on the close parallel between the principles of grammatical  combination and the principles of genetic combination. In the technical language of genetics, sequences  of DNA are said to contain &ldquo;letters&rdquo; and &ldquo;punctuation&rdquo;; may be &ldquo;palindromic,&rdquo;  &ldquo;meaningless,&rdquo; or &ldquo;synonymous&rdquo;; are &ldquo;transcribed&rdquo; and &ldquo;translated&rdquo;;&rsquo; and are  even stored in &ldquo;libraries.&rdquo; Immunologist  Niels Jerne entitled his Nobel Prize address, &ldquo;The Generative Grammar of the  Immune System.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Steven  Pinker, <em>The Language Instinct</em>, 76 </p>
<p><em></em>The  scriptures teach that nature <em>declares</em> the creative, omnipotent power of God:</p>
The heavens <em>proclaim</em> the glory of God. The skies <em>declare</em> the work of His hands. Day to  day pours forth <u>speech</u>, and  night to night reveals <u>knowledge</u>.   Psalm 19:1.2  NLT
<ul>
  <li><u>God&rsquo;s  word in history</u><em>.</em> The power of  God&rsquo;s word in creation is also manifested in history, as we will explore in  greater detail. Old Testament prophets  were careful to make the connection between God&rsquo;s <em>omnipotent </em>word in creation and his <em>sovereign </em>word in history.  God &ldquo;calls&rdquo; and &ldquo;covenants&rdquo; with his people... </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Thus  says the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: &ldquo;Ask Me about the things  to come concerning My sons [history], and you shall commit to Me the work of My  hands. It is I who made the earth and created man upon it. I stretched out the heavens with My hands and  I ordained all their host. [nature]&rdquo;   Isaiah  45:11,12</p>
<p>Just  as nature bears the fingerprints of God, so history too is meaningful&mdash;biblical  eschatology, a beginning and an end, reveal the plan of God.</p>
<p><strong><em>Revelation and  &ldquo;propositional truth&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>Correspondence of <em>word</em> (<u>si</u>g<u>nifier</u>) to  objective <em>reality</em> (<u>si</u>g<u>nified</u>)
</p>
<p>Proposition: &ldquo;God is good&rdquo;... 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Contrast  with &ldquo;poetic truth&rdquo; or mythology</li>
</ul>
<p>All  of these wonderful poetic images of mythology are referring to something in  you. When your mind is simply trapped by  the image out there so that you never make the reference to yourself, you have  misread the image... Now you can personify god in many, many ways. Is there one god? Are there many gods? Those are merely categories of thought... </p>
<p> Joseph Campbell, <em>The Power of Myth</em></p>
<p>Myth,  in this view, is a symbolic pathway to the inner self, along the lines of  Freud&rsquo;s theory of myth and the subconscious or Karl Jung&rsquo;s archetypes of the  unconscious. Here<em> the signified is the self</em>.  More traditional scholarship recognizes myth&rsquo;s relationship to  sympathetic magic&mdash;the attempt to control the spirits who animate nature. But the literary form of Hebrew narrative is  polemical and historical (fact-based), not mythological.</p>
The  ancient Hebrew writers purposefully nurtured and developed prose narration to  take the place of the epic genre which by its content was intimately bound up  with the world of paganism, and appears to have had a special standing in the  polytheistic cults. The recitation of the epics was tantamount to an enactment  of cosmic events in the manner of sympathetic magic. In the process of total  rejection of the polytheistic religions and their ritual expressions in the  cult, epic songs and also the epic genre were purged from the repertoire of the  Hebrew authors. 
<p> Shemaryahu Talmon, &ldquo;The Comparative Method  in Biblical Interpretation&mdash;</p>
<p> Principles and  Problems,&rdquo; in Robert Alter, <em>Art of  Biblical Narrative </em></p>
see G.E. Wright, <em>The Old Testament Against Its Environment</em>, 16-41
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Challenge  of Logical Positivism&mdash;verification principle</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The  criterion which we use to test the genuineness of apparent statements of fact  is the criterion of <em>verifiability</em>. We say that a sentence is factually  significant to any given person, if, and only if, he knows how to verify the  proposition which it purports to express&mdash;that is, if he knows <em>what observations would lead him to accept  the proposition as being true</em>... A.J. Ayer, <em>Language, Truth and Logic</em></p>
<p> The <em>signifier</em>,  &ldquo;God is good&rdquo; is meaningless, being <em>neither</em> true nor false, because  the <em>signified (God </em>and<em> good) </em>is beyond the limits of empirical verification. </p>
<p>But what observations  might verify the verification principle?  Irony: A criterion for meaning that lacks all meaning&mdash;self-defeating.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Challenge  of Postmodern Theory&mdash;&ldquo;Sapir-Whorf hypothesis&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><em>all thought is words</em>&mdash; the <em>signifier </em>is<em> the signified</em></p>
<p>The forms  of a person&rsquo;s thought are controlled by inexorable laws of pattern of which he  is unconscious. These patterns are the  unperceived intricate systematizations of his own language... every language is  a vast pattern-system, different from others, in which are culturally ordained  the forms and categories by which the personality not only communicates, but  also analyzes nature, notices or neglects types of relationships and phenomena,  channels his reasoning, and builds the house of his consciousness.</p>
<p> Benjamin  Whorf, <em>Language,</em> <em>Thought and Reality</em>, 214 </p>
<p></p>
<p>Three  problems with the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis:</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Some  moments of creative and rational insight come through images, not words
      <ul>
        <li>The  psychical entities which seem to serve as elements in thought are certain signs  and more or less clear images which can be voluntarily reproduced and  combined... This combinatory play seems to be the essential feature in  productive thought&mdash;<em>before there is any  connection with logical construction in words or other kinds of signs which can  be communicated to others</em>. The  above-mentioned elements are, in my case, of visual type. Conventional words or other signs have to be  sought for laboriously only in a secondary state, when the mentioned  associative play is sufficiently established and can be reproduced at will. Albert  Einstein, cited in Steven Pinker, <em>The  Language Instinct</em>, 62</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Universal  logical structure underlying all language making translation possible. </li>
    
    <li>Process  of language acquisition with children presupposes the already existing mental  mechanisms necessary to use and interpret language. Pinker concludes from his summary of the  language acquisition research, 
      <ul>
        <li>&ldquo;If babies did not have a &ldquo;mentalese&rdquo;  to translate to and from English, it is not clear how learning English could  take place, or even what learning English would mean.&rdquo;</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Propositional  Truth and &ldquo;Universal Grammar&rdquo;
    <ul>
      <li>Are our thoughts couched in some  silent medium of the brain&mdash;a language of thought, or &ldquo;mentalese&rdquo;&mdash;and merely  clothed in words whenever we need to communicate to a listener? Steven Pinker, <em>The Language Instinct</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Language  and mind</p>
<p></p>
<p>A close-up examination of what it  takes to put words together into ordinary sentences reveals that <u>mental  language</u> mechanisms must have a <u>complex design</u>, with many  interacting parts.... One now sees a common design to the machinery underlying  the world&rsquo;s language, a <em>Universal Grammar</em>. Unless this basic <u>design</u> is built in  to the mechanism that learns a particular grammar, learning would be  impossible. There are many possible ways  of generalizing from parents&rsquo; speech to the language as a whole, and children  home in on the right ones, fast... Just as language is an improbable feat  requiring intricate <u>mental software</u>, the other accomplishments of mental  life that we take for granted, like perceiving, reasoning, and acting, require  their own <u>well-engineered mental software</u>. Just as there is a universal design to the  computations of grammar, there is a <u>universal design to the rest of the  human mind</u>...    Steven Pinker, <em>The Language Instinct</em>, 424, 425</p>
<p></p>
<p>Flexibility in learned behavior  requires <u>innate constraints on the mind</u>... the ability of children to  generalize to an infinite number of potential sentences depends on their  analyzing parental speech using a <u>fixed set of mental categories</u>. </p>
<p> Steven Pinker, <em>The Language Instinct</em>, 434</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adaptive  instinct or image of God?</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;awe,&rdquo; &ldquo;engineering  excellence,&rdquo; &ldquo;mind,&rdquo; &ldquo;miracle,&rdquo; &ldquo;complex design,&rdquo;...<em></em></p>
<p><em>The gift of language.</em> Words are not just animal noises, like a bird chirping or a cow mooing,  that cause neuro-chemical responses for the purpose of adaptation or  reproduction. Words express <em>meaning</em> through propositions, or statements.  Words are a symbolic form of communication possible only for conscious,  rational, intentional beings concerned not merely with survival, but with the  pursuit of the lofty notions of truth, beauty, goodness, and love. Through language, a person understands their  inner life and discloses their thoughts and feelings to another. This ability is one of the evidences of  humanity&rsquo;s unique creation in God&rsquo;s image and is the basis for His revelation  to us. </p>
<p><strong>Side  Bar: Reason, Language and the Case for God</strong>. For a detailed  study, see C.S. Lewis, <em>Miracles</em>,  chapters 1-3; Alvin Plantinga, <em>Religion  and Science: Where the Conflict Really Lies</em> and <em>Warrant And Proper Function</em>; Moises Silva, <em>God, Language and Scripture: Reading the Bible in the Light of General  Linguistics</em>, 21ff.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em><u>Application</u></em></strong><strong><em>: Language and Knowing God</em></strong><em> </em></p>
<p><em></em><em>Ways of knowing. </em>When  we say that we know something or someone, what do we really mean? What does it mean to <em>know</em>? <em>The Bible presents us with interrelated modes of knowledge, rooted in  how God created us as personal beings and relates to us through language</em>. </p>
<p><em></em>First,  God&rsquo;s word comes to us in the <em>propositional</em> terms of language, or <em>de dicto</em> knowledge. That is, truths <em>about</em> God  are revealed in the sentences of scripture.  These are statements of fact, meaning that they can be weighed against  the evidence of science, reason, experience, and history (see Luke 1:1&mdash;4). </p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>If  humans, in the image of God, share the same &ldquo;cognitive wiring&rdquo; as God, words  describing God have objective, not mystical meaning and significance. God is infinitely greater, but not  categorically different. Humans are  &ldquo;theomorphic&rdquo;</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>Second,  scripture provides <em>wisdom</em>, or <em>de re</em> knowledge. Wisdom is the practical art of understanding  (Gr. <em>phronesis</em>) that comes from  living out the truths of scripture.  Cultivating wisdom brings forth awareness, an insight into the way  things are, the essence of things (Gr. <em>sophia</em>). Like an apprentice learning his craft from a  master, students of the Bible begin to think and assess life from God&rsquo;s perspective,  according to his priorities, creating clarity and a discerning eye for life  that results in blessing (Heb. 5:14; 1 Cor. 2:14; Ps. 1, 119). </p>
<p>Third,  the scriptures cultivate <em>personal</em>, or <em>de se</em> knowing. That is, the  scriptures not only reveal truths <em>about</em> God, they are also a means through which we can enjoy personal communion <em>with</em> God mediated by the Holy  Spirit. That God&rsquo;s word is personal is  evident in Christ: the Word made flesh (John 1:1&mdash;4). The written word, like the incarnate Word, is  personal communication between God and His people.</p>
<p><em>Word of God and the mind of man. </em>The  scripture is more than mere words on a page.  Biblical truth is &ldquo;living and active&rdquo; and able to expose the &ldquo;thoughts  and intentions of the heart&rdquo; (Heb. 4:12).  God communicates directly to our hearts and minds through His word. So scripture is &ldquo;food&rdquo; for the hungry (Deut.  8:3; 1 Pet. 2:2); a &ldquo;shield&rdquo; for the defenseless (Pr. 30:5); a &ldquo;sword&rdquo; for  spiritual combat (Eph. 6:17); a guide to the perplexed (Ps. 119:105,169). </p>
<p><em>Word of God and the mind of God. </em>The  awareness that scripture is &ldquo;God-breathed&rdquo;  (2 Tim. 3:16), that He speaks to us through His living word is truly  transforming.<em> </em>More remarkable still is the realization that  through the scripture, we actually think the very thoughts of God! This is worth a moment&rsquo;s reflection. All fields of knowledge seek ultimate  reality, ultimate answers. Physicists try  to form a &ldquo;theory of everything,&rdquo; philosophers seek timeless, universal truth,  religious seekers set out to discover transcendent reality. Humans by nature have a need deep within to  fully know. As Socrates lay dying, he  comforted his fellow seekers of truth saying, </p>
<p>Students  of the Bible seek the Source of all truth.  And the seeking is not without reward:  Amazingly, through the scripture, we are transported into the counsel of  heaven (Rev. 4:1,2). Because we are  indwelled by the Spirit, we have the mind of Christ (1 Cor. 2:10&mdash;16). And like Moses at Sinai, we are transformed  as we behold Him as in a mirror (2 Cor. 3:18), eagerly anticipating the moment  we will &ldquo;fully know, just as we are fully known&rdquo; (1 Cor. 13:12).<em> </em>This  is the extraordinary pleasure and privilege of scripture&mdash;to enter into the mind  and heart of God! We really should view  our time in God&rsquo;s word as worship and preparation for eternity. </p>
<p>For  a helpful discussion of the range of knowledge, see David Lewis, &ldquo;Attitudes De  Dicto and De Se,&rdquo; <em>Philosophical Review</em>,  88:513&mdash;543. See also Michael Polanyi, <em>Personal Knowledge, 347&mdash;380. </em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Finding the Center: Unity of Biblical Theology</strong></p>
<p><em>Is the Old Testament one coherent  story? </em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Why  unity matters</li>
</ul>
<p>One  or many contrasting narratives? eg: Hindu-myth; myths of national origin;  validation for monarchy; man&rsquo;s search for God... scriptures... </p>
<p><em>How could we recognize the presence of  actual unity? </em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Unity  identified inductively from the text. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Scripture interprets scripture.</em> In inductive reasoning, we look for <em>meaning  drawn from the text itself</em>, not some meaning imposed on it. <em>The  interpretative principles are found explicitly or assumed in the text</em>. Like detectives, Bible interpreters look to  the evidence of scripture for clues to its meaning. </p>
<p>1. Explicit statements of purpose. Psalm 33:10,11; Isaiah 14:24; 46:8-11; Micah  4:12</p>
<p>2. Future-directed promises, blessings,  covenants</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>	 The Bible&rsquo;s linear view of history</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The predicament of man is a  predicament of God who has a stake in the human situation. Sin, guilt, suffering, cannot be separated  from the divine situation. The life of  sin is more than a failure of man; it is a frustration to God. Thus, man&rsquo;s alienation from God is not the  ultimate fact by which to measure man&rsquo;s situation. The fact of God&rsquo;s participation in the  predicament of man, is the elemental fact. Abraham Heschel, <em>The Prophets</em></p></blockquote>
  <p>	Key  promises are given, then repeated throughout the Old and New Testaments</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3. &ldquo;Inner-testamental commentary&rdquo;&mdash;repetitions,  etc.: marker/link; motif; repetitions...</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Within  the Bible we find hundreds of references and allusions to other passages that  provide a clear foundation for understanding how the text is meant to be  understood. In this way, the Bible  supplies its own commentary, or guide to interpretation. Biblical writers used techniques like <em>repetition </em>to unify themes developed  over hundreds of years by numerous authors.  These repetitions are of four general types and provide the core of <em>inter-textual commentary</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><em>Technical terms.</em> Words used by numerous biblical authors to convey the same idea or a  growing theme in the scripture:  &ldquo;Branch,&rdquo; &ldquo;Son,&rdquo; &ldquo;Servant,&rdquo; &ldquo;Day of the Lord,&rdquo; &ldquo;Christ,&rdquo; &ldquo;kingdom,&rdquo;  &ldquo;temple,&rdquo; &ldquo;grace,&rdquo; etc.</li>
  <li><em>Event repetition.</em> Reference to key events, especially in Israel&rsquo;s history, that show a  continuity and pattern of meaning over time:  Exodus, creation, wilderness wandering, etc. This is called <em>motif</em>: the meaning of the present or future is defined in terms of  a past event.</li>
  <li><em>Direct quotes or allusions.</em> Almost every biblical writer quotes or alludes to other biblical  texts. Careful analysis will show <em>how </em>a later author understood earlier  texts, thus shedding light on both the scripture cited and the passage in which  the citation occurs.</li>
</ul>
<p>For  an excellent explanation of the concept of repetition as a literary and  theological technique and inter-textual commentary demonstrating continuity and  unity throughout the Bible, see Walter Kaiser, <em>Toward An Exegetical Theology;</em> Michael Fishbane, <em>Text and Texture</em> and <em>Biblical Interpretation in Ancient Israel</em>;  Richard Longnecker, <em>Biblical Exegesis in  the Apostolic Period</em>.</p>

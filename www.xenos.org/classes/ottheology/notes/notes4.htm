<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><em>Week Four: The  Meaning and Means of Salvation</em></strong></p>
Connecting  some dots...
<ul>
  <li>Shift  from the essential <em>nature</em> of God  (Exodus 34:6,7) to the concrete <em>actions</em> of God in salvation. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Salvation history and &ldquo;motif&rdquo;</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Linear  history and eschatology
    <ul>
      <li>On every continent,  in every society, [Abraham] would have been given the same advice that wise men  as diverse as Heraclitus, Lao-tsu, and Siddhartha  would one day give their followers: do  not journey but sit; compose yourself by the river of life, meditate on its  ceaseless and meaningless flow&mdash;on all that is past or passing or to come&mdash;until  you have absorbed the pattern and have come to peace with the great Wheel and with your own death  and the death of all things in the corruptible sphere. -- Thomas Cahill, <em>The Gifts of the Jews</em>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Plan of salvation (Psalm 33:10,11; Isaiah  14:24; 46:8-11; Micah 4:12) </li>
  <li>Paradigms  and the meaning of salvation 
    <ul>
      <li>&ldquo;Motif&rdquo;  is a <em>pattern</em> or <em>theme recurring</em> in the Bible.  The meaning of a defining event spills over into future events or a  promise develops fuller implications through the movement of biblical  history. 
        <ul>
          <li>The  barren woman as a paradigm of God&rsquo;s faithfulness to his promises          </li>
          <li>The  seed (Genesis 3:15) that sprouts into a branch (Jeremiah 23:5) </li>
          <li> <em>Creation motif: regeneration</em>&mdash;life out of chaos and lifelessness,  new life by the hand of God, the Maker, Creator, the Beginning and the End.</li>
          <li> <em>Kingdom motif</em>&mdash;in forming a unique covenant people,  God the King exercises his <em>reign</em> over  the earth</li>
          <li> <em>Exodus motif: redemption</em>&mdash;from bondage to freedom, God is the  Redeemer
            <ul>
              <li>Thus says the Lord  your <u>Redeemer</u>, the Holy One of Israel, &ldquo;For your sake I have sent to  Babylon, and will bring them all down as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, into  the ships in which they rejoice. I am  the Lord, your Holy One, the <u>Creator</u> of Israel, your <u>King</u>.&rdquo;   Isaiah 43:14,15              </li>
  <li> He rescued us from  the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the <u>kingdom of His beloved Son</u>,  in whom we have <u>redemption</u>, the forgiveness of sins. He is the image of the invisible God, the  firstborn of all creation. For by Him  all things were created, both in the heavens and on the earth, visible and  invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities&mdash;all things  have been created through Him and for Him.  He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together. He is also head of the body, the <u>firstborn  from the dead</u>, so that He Himself will come to have first place in  everything. For it was the Father&rsquo;s good  pleasure for all the fullness to dwell  in Him, and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross; through  Him, I say, whether things on earth or in heaven. --Colossians 1:13-20</li>
  </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Fulfillment  and the unity of scripture
    <ul>
      <li>Filling  (<em>pleroo</em>) of  history&mdash;&ldquo;fullness of time&rdquo; Gal. 4:4 
      </li>
      <li>Contrasted  with the prediction&mdash;fulfillment pattern, history itself is being fulfilled 
      </li>
    </ul>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><u>The  Exodus Motif: Salvation As Redemption</u></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Concept of redemption</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Abraham&mdash;<em>go&rsquo;el</em> to  Lot. 
        <ul>
          <li>&ldquo;Redeemer,&rdquo;  &ldquo;redeemed,&rdquo; &ldquo;price of redemption&rdquo;
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Ruth&mdash;kinsman  redeemer    </li>
  </ul>
  <li><em>Exodus and redemption from Egypt. Exodus 3&mdash;19 </em>
    <ul>
      <li>God  remembers and redeems
        <ul>
          <li>It  came about in the course of many days that the king of Egypt died. And the sons of Israel sighed because of the  bondage, and they cried out; and their cry for help because of their bondage  rose up to God. God heard their groaning; and God remembered His covenant with  Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. God saw the  sons of Israel, and God took notice of them. Exodus  2:23-25 </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>&ldquo;I  am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of  Jacob.&rdquo; Then Moses hid his face, for he  was afraid to look at God. The Lord  said, &ldquo;I have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and  have given heed to their cry because of their taskmasters, for I am aware of  their suffering. So I have come down to <u>deliver</u> them from the power of the Egyptians, and to bring them up from that land to a  good and spacious land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of  the Canaanite&hellip;Now behold, the cry of the sons of Israel has come to Me;  furthermore, I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians are oppressing  them.&rdquo; Exodus 3:6-9</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Father/son  relationship of God to Israel 
      <ul>
        <li>You  shall say to Pharaoh, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord, Israel is My son, My firstborn. So I say to you, &lsquo;Let My so that he go he may  serve me.&rdquo; Exodus 4:22-23a
        </li>
        <li><em>Corporate sonship</em> of Israel (Deuteronomy 14:1; Isaiah  1:2; Jeremiah 3:14). One represents the  many; the many are defined by the one.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Defeat  of Israel&rsquo;s spiritual and natural captors (Exodus 7-11)
      <ul>
        <li>The  Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;See, I make you as God to  Pharaoh and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet. You shall speak all I command you, and your  brother Aaron shall speak to Pharaoh that he let the sons of Israel go out of  his land. But I will harden Pharaoh&rsquo;s  heart that I may multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt. When Pharaoh does not listen to you, then I  will lay My hand on Egypt and bring out My hosts, My people the sons of Israel,  from the land of Egypt by great judgments.  The Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I stretch out My hand  on Egypt and bring out the sons of Israel from their midst.&rdquo;  Exodus 7:1-5
        </li>
        <li>Plagues  and the gods of the Egyptians <strong></strong>        
          <ul>
            <li>I will go through  the land of Egypt on that night, and will strike down all the firstborn in the  land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will  execute judgments&mdash;I am the Lord.  Exodus 12:12</li>
            <li>The  Lord struck down their firstborn. The  Lord had also executed judgments on their gods. --Numbers 33:4</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Exodus  deliverance, redemption is historical (&ldquo;house of slavery&rdquo; 11x) <em>and</em> spiritual
          <ul>
            <li>No man can by any  means redeem his brother or give to God a ransom for him&mdash;for the redemption of  his soul is costly, and he should cease trying forever&mdash;that he should live on  eternally, that he should not undergo decay... But God will redeem my soul from  the power of Sheol, for He will receive me. Psalm 49:7-9,15 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Price  of redemption and a new beginning for God&rsquo;s people (12:1-14).    
      <ul>
        <li>&ldquo;This month shall  be the beginning of months for you; it is to be the first month of the year to  you. Speak to all the congregation of  Israel, saying, &lsquo;On the tenth of this month they are each to take a lamb for  themselves, according to their fathers&rsquo; households, a lamb for each household&hellip;  Your lamb shall be an unblemished male a year old; you may take it from the  sheep or from the goats. You shall keep  it until the fourteenth day of the same month, then the whole assembly of the  congregation of Israel is to kill it at twilight. Moreover, they shall take some of the blood  and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses in which they  eat it. They shall eat the flesh that  same night, roasted with fire, and they shall eat it with unleavened bread and  bitter herbs&hellip; Now you shall eat I in ths manner: with your loins girded, your sandals on your  feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste&mdash;it is the  Lord&rsquo;s Passover. For I will go through  the land of Egypt on that night, and will strike down all the firstborn in the  land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of the Egyptian I  will execute judgments&mdash;I am the Lord.&rdquo;  This day will be a memorial to you, and you shall celebrate it as a  feast to the Lord; throughout your generations you are to celebrate it as a  permanent ordinance.&rdquo;   Exodus 12:2-14</li>
        <li>Redemption  requires a price&mdash;<em>ransom, purchase </em>
        </li>
        <li>Principle  of <em>substitution</em> and <em>representation</em>
          <ul>
            <li>Purpose  of sacrifice differs in the extreme with ancient Near East practices </li>
            <li>Redemption  (freedom) and atonement (propitiation, satisfaction). See also Hebrews 9:12,15; Colossians 1:14;  Ephesians 1:7 </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Beginning  of the year and permanent annual celebration </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Pathway  to freedom (13-19) 
      <ul>
        <li>The Lord was going before them in a pillar of  cloud by day to lead them on the way, and in a pillar of fire by night to give  them light, that they might travel by day and by night&hellip; Moses stretched out his hand over the sea;  and the Lord swept the sea back by a strong east wind all night and turned the  sea into dry land, so the waters were divided.  The sons of Israel went through the midst of the sea on the dry land,  and the waters were like a wall to them on their right and left&hellip;.Then the  Egyptians took up the pursuit, and all Pharaoh&rsquo;s chariots and horsemen went in  after them into the midst of the sea&hellip; then the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Stretch out  your hand over the sea so that the waters may come back over the Egyptians,  over their chariots and horsemen&hellip; Thus  the Lord saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians. Exodus 14
          <ul>
            <li>cloud  and pillar of fire for <em>guidance</em> and <em>protection</em></li>
            <li>water  from the rock in an arid land and manna for hunger as a <em>provision</em></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>You yourselves have seen what I did to the  Egyptians, how I bore you on eagles&rsquo; wings, and brought you to Myself. If you indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant,  then you shall be My own possession among all the peoples, for all the earth is  Mind; and you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. <em> </em>Exodus  19:4-6</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul></ul>
<p><em></em><em>Exodus and the flow of biblical  revelation: forming the motif of salvation:</em></p>
<p>Recollection of the ancient exodus from Egypt  serves the speaker as a hedge against despair and a catalyst towards renewed  hope. The simultaneous capacity of the  exodus paradigm to elicit memory and expectation, recollection and  anticipation, discloses once again its deep embeddedness  as a fundamental structure of the biblical historical imagination.

<p>Exodus  unfolds in the prophets: [Exodus] recurs in texts of each  generation... the &ldquo;exodus&rdquo; motif emphasizes the temporal-historical paradigm in  whose image all future restorations of the nation are to be manifest. A concord between the first and succeeding  redemptions is the issue, for each generation looked to the first exodus as the  archetypal expression of its own future hope. -- Michael Fishbane<em>, Text and Texture</em>, 121

      <li>Shepherd Your people with Your scepter, the  flock of Your possession which dwells by itself in the woodland, in the midst  of a fruitful field. Let them feed in  Bashan and Gilead as in the days of old. &ldquo;As in the days when you came out from  the land of Egypt, I will show you miracles.&rdquo;
      Micah 7:14,15</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Return  from Babylonian captivity is a &ldquo;second exodus&rdquo; for Israel
    <ul>
      <li>When  Israel was a youth I loved him, and out of Egypt I called My son. Hosea 11:1 </li>
      <li>Then  it will happen <u>on that day</u> that the Lord will again recover the second  time with His hand the remnant of His people who will remain. Isaiah  11:11</li>
      <li>For  thus says the Lord God, &ldquo;My people went down at the first into Egypt to reside  there; then the Assyrian oppressed them without cause. Now therefore, what do I have here,&rdquo; declares  the Lord, &ldquo;seeing that My people have been taken away without cause?&rdquo; Again the Lord declares, &ldquo;Those who rule over  them howl, and My name is continually blasphemed all day long. Therefore My people shall know My name;  therefore <u>in that day</u> I am the one who is speaking, &ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;  Isaiah 52:4-6
      </li>
      <li>Therefore  behold, <u>days are coming</u>,&rdquo; declares the Lord, &ldquo;when it will no longer be  said, &lsquo;As the Lord lives, who brought up the sons of Israel out of the land of  Egypt,&rsquo; but, &lsquo;As the Lord lives, who brought up the sons of Israel from the  land of the north and from all the countries where He had banished them.&rsquo; For I will restore them to their own land  which I gave to their fathers.&rdquo;  Jeremiah 16:14,15
      </li>
      <li>Therefore  behold, the <u>days are coming</u>,&rdquo; declares the Lord, &ldquo;when they will not  longer say, &lsquo;As the Lord lives, who brought you the sons of Israel from the  land of Egypt.&rsquo;, but; &rsquo;As the Lord lives, who brought up and led back the  descendants of the household of Israel from the north land and from all the co0untrues  where I had driven them.&rsquo; Then they will  live on their own soil.&rdquo;  Jeremiah 23:7,8
      </li>
      <li>The  concept of &ldquo;shadow and substance&rdquo; and &ldquo;day&rdquo; in the exodus motif:
        <ul>
          <li>This formulation, phrased as a radically new  teaching (&ldquo;behold days are coming... when no one will say... but rather&rdquo;), is  similar to other Jeremiah texts which anticipate a religious change in the  future (cf. 3:16; 7:22; 31:28ff; where the phrase &ldquo;in future days...no  longer...but&rdquo; recurs). -- Fishbane, <em>Text  and Texture</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Exodus  and the nations
    <ul>
      <li>All  of the nations are to be blessed in Abraham (Genesis 12:3). The prophets put forth the picture of a  coming time when the nations will join in with the blessing of Israel&rsquo;s  redemption. 
      </li>
      <li>Many nations will join themselves to the Lord <u>in that day</u> and will become My people.
        --Zechariah 2:11 (see also Amos 9:7; Isaiah 56:1-7; Zephaniah 3:9,10; Zechariah 8:20-23)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Redemption  for Israel&rsquo;s enemies
    <ul>
      <li>In that day there will be an altar to the <u>Lord  in the midst of the land of Egypt</u>, and a pillar to the Lord near its  border. It will become a sign and a  witness to the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt; for they will cry to the  Lord because of oppressors, and <u>He will send them a Savior and a Champion</u>,  and He will <u>deliver</u> (redeem) them.  Thus the Lord <u>will make Himself known to Egypt</u>, and the <u>Egyptians  will know the Lord in that day</u>. They  will even <u>worship with sacrifice and offering</u>, and will make a vow to  the Lord and perform it. The Lord will  strike Egypt, striking but healing; so they will return to the Lord, and He  will respond them and will heal them. 
      In that day there will be a <u>highway from  Egypt to Assyria</u>, and the Assyrians will come into Egypt and the Egyptians  into Assyria, and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians. <u>In that day</u>, Israel will be the third  party with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth, whom the  Lord of hosts has blessed, saying, &ldquo;<u>Blessed is Egypt My people</u>, and <u>Assyria  the work of My hands</u>, and Israel My inheritance.&rdquo; Isaiah  19:19-25
</li>
      <li>Consider  Isaiah&rsquo;s context&mdash;Jerusalem under siege and both of her enemies are engaged in  horrific battle (see ch. 20); and Heschel&rsquo;s  in the shadow of the holocaust:
        <ul>
          <li>What is history? Wars, victories, and wars. So many dead.  So many tears. So little regret. So many fears. And who could sit in judgment over the  victims of cruelty when their horror turns to hatred? Is it easy to keep the horror of wickedness  from turning into a hatred of the wicked?  The world is drenched in blood, and the guilt is endless. Should not all hope be abandoned? What saved the prophets from despair was  their messianic vision and the idea of man&rsquo;s capacity for repentance... The God  of Israel is also the God of her enemies, without their knowing Him and despite  their defying Him. The enmity between  the nations will turn to friendship &ldquo;in that day.&rdquo; -- Abraham  Heschel, <em>The  Prophets</em>, 236,237</li>
          <li>No longer is the exodus the private tradition  of Israel alone: it becomes the symbolic form through which a <u>messianic  movement</u> is envisaged. Egypt, the  first oppressor of Israel, will one day have its share in an &ldquo;exodus&rdquo;-type  event.... Isaiah pushed the language of cultural memory to the limit of its  innermost possibilities. This is acutely  felt in 19:25, where Egypt is called &ldquo;My people.&rdquo; In fact, such a transfer of a designation  used pointedly of Israel (Exodus 3:10) weighed heavily on ancient Jewish translators. Unable to tolerate such a theological  paradox, the Septuagint and Targum traditions  renationalized the text and substituted Israel for Egypt.

<p><strong><em>Side Bar:New  Testament use of the Old Testament-- Matthew 2:15 cf. Hosea 11:1</em></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>key interpretative questions:</em></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>How  does Matthew understand Hosea 11:1 to be <em>fulfilled</em> in Jesus&rsquo; family&rsquo;s flight to Egypt? How  is Hosea&rsquo;s text legitimately messianic?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Is  Matthew&rsquo;s use of Hosea consistent with the prophet&rsquo;s own interpretative  approach to Exodus 4:22 and Numbers 24:8?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Observations from Hosea</em></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Context</em> of  Hosea 11 within the flow of the book</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Hosea 11 is one of the three  major oracles of hope after God&rsquo;s case against Israel is declared (4:1). In contrast to Israel&rsquo;s unfaithfulness and  the exile to which they will go, God cares for and will <em>preserve</em> Israel (6:1&mdash;3; 11:1&mdash;11; 14:1&mdash;9).</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Informing theology:</em> &ldquo;My son.&rdquo;  Israel as God&rsquo;s son was an accepted technical term (Exod. 4:22,23; Num.  24:8). The many were represented by the  singular, &ldquo;son.&rdquo; And the one  representing the many is an established messianic term (2 Samuel 7:14; Psalm  2:7; Isaiah 9:6). </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Prophetic concept of history:</em> Hosea uses Israel&rsquo;s departure from Egypt as a  reminder of God&rsquo;s <em>ongoing exodus hope</em> for his people (Isaiah 11;11) through the Davidic King (Isaiah 11:1&mdash;5). </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>For Hosea, Egypt is synonymous  with Assyria (metonymic parallelism 9:3; see Ps. 114:1&mdash;3). Egypt is thus a <em>symbol</em> of bondage (8;13; 9:3, 6; 11:3&mdash;5; 12:13). See also Rev. 11:8.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Hosea&rsquo;s prophetic message:</em> Consistent with the prophetic understanding of  history, Israel&rsquo;s hope, rooted in the historic past, will look to the future  exodus of God from the current &ldquo;Egypt.&rdquo; <em>The past overflows into the future as  history fulfills God&rsquo;s redemption. </em>And by invoking the <em>part </em>of the motif that fits the situation, the <em>entire</em> meaning of the motif is presumed by the author. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Matthew 2 and the use of Hosea 11:1</em></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Matthew  looks to the exodus theme as it unfolds in the prophets, using exactly the same  view of history:</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Just as under Moses God  preserved his <em>son</em> in Egypt and  &ldquo;called out my son,&rdquo; so, Hosea declares, he will again under Assyrian (Egypt)  captivity with a new exodus. In Matthew,  as Son in the<em> fullest</em> sense, Jesus  completes (pleroo) the motif&mdash;as his ministry also  bears witness. As Hosea fits into the  broader prophetic motif of exodus, which includes an explicit messianic  dimension (Isaiah 11; Jeremiah 23), Matthew is invoking that part of the motif  that fits the situation he is describing in the Gospel narrative of Jesus. But by invoking part of the motif, the  assumption is that it carries the breadth of the motif&rsquo;s meaning. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Both Hosea and Matthew  understand that God preserves his &ldquo;son&rdquo; in &ldquo;Egypt&rdquo; and anticipates the time  when the Lord will &ldquo;call out my son.&rdquo; In  this sense Matthew uses Hosea 11 in the <em>same</em> sense Hosea used Exodus 4 and Numbers 24. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>No rabbinic approach such as <em>midrash</em> or <em>pesher</em><em>,</em> or the Roman Catholic doctrine of <em>sensus</em><em> plenior </em>need be  assumed, but a consistent exegetical approach by both Hosea and Matthew. </p>

<p>The relaxed parent has realistic expectations &#150; of himself and of his children. </i>

<ul>
  <li>Our job isn&#146;t to make our children happy, but to help them become more human.</li>
  <li>We have expectations in our mind about &quot;the good parent&quot;. When we come close
    to meeting them, we feel content &amp; competent. When we don&#146;t we feel guilty or
    anxious.</li>
</ul>
<i><b>

<p>9 Principles for Parenting in Reality </b></i>

<ol>
  <li>Trying to communicate like an adult with your child leads to frustration. Focus on
    listening &amp; tuning into the emotions rather than the actual words.</li>
  <li>If you are angry, say so. But do it in such a way that it doesn&#146;t insult or blame</li>
  <li>Trying to &quot;do it all&quot; is a guaranteed path to burnout. Sometimes we help most
    by not helping.</li>
  <li>Feelings aren&#146;t good or bad, they just are.</li>
  <li>Punishment as a means of correction isn&#146;t enough. We need to teach appropriate
    behavior through discipline.</li>
  <li>Words have tremendous power to heal, affirm &amp; guide our children.</li>
  <li>When we acknowledge our child&#146;s strong negative emotions instead of trying to
    change them, we communicate acceptance at a time when our child needs it the most.</li>
  <li>We help our child by preparing them to make good decisions. One way to do this is
    teaching by using consequences.</li>
  <li>We communicate dignity &amp; respect to our child. We avoid shaming them.</li>

<p>The relaxed parent understands the trends affecting children in order to understand his
own children.</p>
<b>

<p>Ten Trends in Childhood </b></i>

<ol>
  <li><u>Less Supervision</u> &#150; Mom&#146;s used to be home &amp; available but not in
    today&#146;s world. Less supervision leads to more independence. Children are left alone
    at an earlier age. They are expected to become independent &amp; are often hurried to
    achieve separation from parents. They are being rushed towards independence.</li>
  <li><u>Too Many Choices</u> &#150; &quot;Young people today are freer than ever before to
    engage in sexual activity, to abuse drugs and to flout adult authority. At the same time,
    they are less prepared than ever before to manage these new freedoms.&quot; David Elkind,
    &quot;The Hurried Child&quot;</li>
  <li><u>A Rush to Adulthood </u>&#150; Instead of sheltering &amp; bestowing our love, we
    treat our children like another task. We want them to grow up in a hurry &amp; we
    don&#146;t protect them from the worries of the adult world.</li>
  <li><u>Loss of Innocence </u>&#150; All of this adult-like behavior &amp; exposure leads to
    a loss of child like innocence.</li>
  <li><u>More Single Parents </u>&#150; The disappearance of marriage as a dependable,
    permanent structure within which children can live out their childhood is surely the most
    consequential change that has occurred in the last two decades. Children begin to
    consider, &quot;<i>Who will take care of me if my parents can&#146;t even take care of
    themselves?</i>&quot;</li>
  <li><u>No More Heroes </u>&#150; Kids used to have heroes for role models. Now they have
    celebrities, Michael Jackson, Madonna, yuck! Children in our country are desperately in
    need of guides &#150; people who know the path &amp; are willing to show the way.</li>
  <li><u>Blurring of Roles &amp; Boundaries </u>&#150; It used to be kids were kids &amp;
    adults were adults, it is kind of blurry today. Two technologies largely responsible for
    pulling down boundaries &amp; making children grow up prematurely are the Internet &amp;
    television sets. Parents need to restore the &quot;top shelf&quot;. There are certain
    things children shouldn&#146;t be exposed to until they are older.</li>
  <li><u>The End of Play </u>&#150; Children often have busy schedules, so busy that their
    play is scheduled, structured &amp; not always relaxing. They work more than they play.
    All this scheduling limits our children&#146;s creativity &amp; experiences with us. </li>
  <li><u>Critical Decisions Too Early </u>&#150; <i>&quot;Am I gay?&quot;</i> Children absorb
    what they are exposed to. They may not fully understand but will process it as best they
    can. It won&#146;t go over their heads if they aren&#146;t ready for it; it will go into
    their heads, ready or not.</li>
  <li><u>Receiving Parents&#146; Money Instead of Time </u>&#150; We try to replace ourselves
    with stuff.</li>

<p>The relaxed parent prepares his children for life by treating them as family members,
not guests. </i>

<ul>
  <li>Kids today have high expectations. A taste for perfection &amp; a distaste for
    discomfort. Everything must be fun &amp; they must have it now.</li>
  <li>When we give our kids everything, it robs them of the joy of anticipation. It replaces
    wonder with an ugly sense of entitlement.</li>
  <li>Why do we do this? To keep them from struggling. To meet their needs &amp; wants. To
    keep them from failure.</li>
  <li>Feeling that one is the center of the universe does not prepare a person to meet the
    demands of an intimate relationship, which requires compromise, negotiation, an
    extraordinary capacity to give, and caring as deeply for another as one does for oneself.</li>
  <li>Our obsession with our children feeling good is not producing children who feel good.
    Our children need to learn that life is not pain-free and that disappointments, sacrifices
    &amp; occasional failures are as much a part of life as party favors, soccer camps &amp;
    Nintendo 64.</li>
  <li>How can we distinguish between needs &amp; wants? Needs are basic biological needs,
    wants are everything else.</li>
  <li>Individuals are important for what they can contribute to the community, not for their
    distinctive individuality.</li>

<p>The relaxed parent chooses to not give children too much, recognizing to do so may be
giving them too little.</p>
<b>

<p>Why We Give In To Our Children </b></i>

<ol>
  <li><u>As a substitute for time</u> &#150; it helps reduce our feelings of guilt.</li>
  <li><u>To avoid confrontation </u>&#150; tired &amp; busy parents don&#146;t want to fight.
    It takes too much energy.</li>
  <li><u>To compensate for our own childhood </u>&#150; we want to treat our kids better than
    our parents treated us.</li>

<p>Traits of Spoiled Rotten Kids </b></i>

<ol>
  <li><u>Feeling Bored</u> &#150; &quot;What have you done for me lately?&quot; </li>
  <li><u>Demanding </u>&#150; They want the best &amp; they want it now!</li>
  <li><u>Addiction to Having &amp; Doing the Latest Fashion </u>&#150; kids are addicted to
    peer approval.</li>
  <li><u>Lack of Sensitivity </u>&#150; they become more &amp; more self-centered &amp;
    typically lack compassion.</li>
  <li><u>Lack of Self-Discipline </u>&#150; haven&#146;t learned the value of persistence.</li>
  <li><u>Selective Truth </u>&#150; honesty is not a value, comfort &amp; freedom are
    esteemed.</li>
  <li><u>Problems with Performance &amp; Competition </u>&#150; seldom good sports. Skilled at
    rationalization.</li>
  <li><u>Focused on the Present </u>&#150; consequences are not considered.</li>
  <li><u>Lack of Purpose </u>&#150; kids with no purpose find &amp; make trouble.</li>
  <li><u>Difficulty with Decisions </u>&#150; quick gratification is the standard so decisions
    are usually made in haste.</li>

    teen conversation is more random &amp; nonsequential, in other words, chaotic.</li>
  <li>Trying to get all the answers &amp; understand drives kids batty. They feel
    interrogated.</li>
  <li>Kids are happy to leave things open-ended, so always seeking closure can be dangerous,
    also.</li>
  <li>Kids talk more in the car. They feel less intimated &amp; can easily change the subject.</li>
</ul>

<p>Four Tips on Talking </b></i>

<ol>
  <li><u>Be sensitive to your child&#146;s limitations</u> &#150; they have limitations with
    focus, experience &amp; relationships.</li>
  <li><u>Talking is 50% your responsibility </u>&#150; our part is to initiate &amp; create an
    environment for conversation; their part is to respond.</li>
  <li><u>Speak for yourself, not your children </u>&#150; if a teen believes you want their
    input &amp; are willing to listen to their perspective, then they are much more likely to
    converse with you.</li>
  <li><u>Spend time with your child </u>&#150; kids are like gardens, they take a lot of time
    &amp; effort.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Remember, no one at the end of their life says, &quot;I wish I would have spent more
      time at work.&quot; </li>
    <li>When we spend chunks of time with our kids, we increase the odds for great
      conversations.</li>
    <li>Quality time happens after we invest quantity time.</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Chapter 11- How to Motivate Your Kids</li>
  </b></font>
</ul>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><i>

<p>The relaxed parent has developed a strategy to move from bribing to motivating. </i>

<ul>
  <li>We want to prepare them for life &amp; then launch them into society. This takes inner
    motivation.</li>
  <li>Parents are either raising characters or building characters.</li>
</ul>
<i><b>

<p>Ten Tips for Motivating Your Child </b></i>

<ol>
  <li><u>Allow your child to fail</u> &#150; we rob our kids of motivation when we rescue
    them.</li>
  <li><u>Give your child regular household responsibilities </u>&#150; when we affirm our
    child&#146;s contribution, they begin to see that they are needed &amp; have something
    valuable to offer. It builds their self-esteem.</li>
  <li><u>Decide to limit what you give your child </u>&#150; be concerned with their needs,
    not their wants. Waiting develops self-control for their later years.</li>
  <li><u>Teach &amp; model respect for people &amp; property </u>&#150; teach them to care for
    &amp; value what belongs to them. They must understand the value of property to respect
    another&#146;s possessions. Model respect by being on time, be courteous with service
    people (waitresses, cashiers, etc.), drive courteously &amp; don&#146;t criticize behind
    someone&#146;s back. (Your kid is watching!)</li>
  <li><u>Build into your child the value of completion </u>&#150; limit their activities &amp;
    teach them completion, a sense of achievement &amp; closure. Otherwise, they learn if
    something gets tough, just quit (won&#146;t work at a job or in a marriage).</li>
  <li><u>Limit exposure to media </u>&#150; they are drowning in information &amp; starved for
    knowledge. When kids are over-stimulated with information they become passive &amp;
    apathetic. Encourage them to read &amp; think, daily.</li>
  <li><u>Teach &amp; model personal virtues over conformity</u> &#150; honesty, faith, hope,
    courage &amp; love are more important than social status. </li>
  <li><u>Hold your child personally accountable </u>&#150; children should be responsible for
    what they say &amp; do. There are always consequences for the choices we make in life.</li>
  <li><u>Work together </u>&#150; projects (school, home, etc.) build relationships. We build
    motivation when we create opportunities to serve together.</li>
  <li><u>Play together </u>&#150; when parents &amp; children relax, laugh &amp; enjoy each
    other, it builds a bond. Having fun is motivating.</li>

</ul>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><i>

<p>The relaxed parent turns over areas of response-ability to his children to help them
learn from the consequences. </i>

<ul>
  <li>Children know us well &amp; how we will respond. The problem becomes, &quot;who is
    training who?&quot;</li>
  <li>Discipline them to learn right behavior, the ability to respond properly to life
    situations, &quot;response-ability&quot;.</li>
  <li>Discipline is the deliberate creation of stress in your relationship with your child for
    the purpose of helping him or her grow &amp; learn.</li>
  <li>Discipline focuses on learning &amp; growing. Punishment focuses on behavior &amp;
    rule-keeping.</li>
  <li>Consequences are tools, not rules. Choose the consequences, inform your children &amp;
    stick to them.</li>
  <li>Natural vs. logical consequences discussed.</li>
  <li>We need to choose our battles wisely or we will be battling all the time. Don&#146;t get
    side-tracked by minor issues.</li>
  <li>Prioritize issues &amp; work on them little by little, don&#146;t expect children to
    improve on all fronts.</li>

<p>Relaxed parents guide their children with timeless principles based on universal truth,
not the latest formulas. </i>

<ul>
  <li>Parents needs to ask themselves, &quot; Why do we have kids &amp; what do we want to
    pass on to them?&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;What can we learn from the previous generation?&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;What do we want to pass on?&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;What do we definitely not want to pass on?&quot;</li>
  <li>We want our children to be whole, loving adults. Confident &amp; productive, at ease
    with the world. How?</li>
  <li>Give them a blessing. By what we say &amp; do, we can affirm their personal worth.</li>
  <li>Write your child a note describing what qualities you like about him/her.</li>
  <li>Ask your child to help plan a family day or vacation</li>
  <li>Keep your child&#146;s current picture at your workplace.</li>
  <li>Tell them, &quot;I have confidence in you.&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;Thanks for being yourself. I like being around you.&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;It sounds like you have been doing some good thinking.&quot;</li>
  <li>Our culture is focused on image &amp; personality. We need to parent on character &amp;
    what lies within our children.</li>
  <li>Effective habits are behaviors that are desirable &amp; based on principles.</li>
  <li>Principle-centered parenting believes there are universal values, values for all
    cultures for all time. Absolutes that govern relationships like natural laws govern
    nature.</li>
  <li>Principle-oriented parenting gives parents a North Star, it helps us focus on important
    issues not the urgent. These are the issues of character, who they are becoming from the
    inside out.</li>

<p>52 Baby Steps Toward Becoming the Relaxed Parent. </b></i></font>

<ol>
  <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  <li>Encourage your children to handle &amp; solve their own problems as much as possible.</li>
  <li>Permit you children to be responsible for every task they can physically handle.</li>
  <li>Don&#146;t always protect your children from the pain of their mistakes.</li>
  <li>If your children forget something, let them experience the consequences. Don&#146;t
    rescue. The consequences will promote greater personal responsibility in the future.</li>
  <li>Choose your battles wisely, or you will be battling all the time.</li>
  <li>Take your &quot;one-a-day vitamin&quot;. Pick one tidbit of advice you want to give your
    children, then swallow it. (Keep it to yourself.)</li>
  <li>Exhibit self-control by not making every moment a teachable moment.</li>
  <li>Spend time building your relationship with your children. Remember that rules without
    relationship lead to rebellion.</li>
  <li>Make sure the guidelines are clear. Remember that relationship without rules leads to
    anarchy.</li>
  <li>Set boundaries even if they are unpopular. Remember that families are not to be
    democracies; they are to be run by parents, not children.</li>
  <li>Connect freedom with responsibility. The worst indulgence is not to make your child
    responsible for his behavior.</li>
  <li>Parents of teens need to move from a position of control to a position of influence.</li>
  <li>Don&#146;t always rescue your children from disappointments, which can help them handle
    failure &amp; imperfection in the future.</li>
  <li>Model your values to your children. The values we hope to see lived out by our children
    will most likely be the values they see lived out in us.</li>
  <li>Affirm character more than achievement. Affirmation of your child&#146;s character
    builds character. Praise for your child&#146;s achievement builds performance.</li>
  <li>Our children&#146;s happiness should not be our first concern. Their growth should be.
    Have one area in mind, which you can help your child grow.</li>
  <li>Include the child in developing consequences. For logical consequences to work, they
    must seem logical to the child.</li>
  <li>Meet as a family once a week to plan schedules, teach values &amp; show love to each
    other.</li>
  <li>Be human enough to your kids to share your weaknesses as well as your strengths. Be
    honest in your relationships with your children.</li>
  <li>Define one character quality you&#146;d like to see developed in your child. Our goal
    should be to develop our child&#146;s character, not promote his popularity.</li>
  <li>Have a weekly family fun time. Parents who have fun with their children have more energy
    to discipline &#150; but don&#146;t need to.</li>
  <li>Schedule a one-on-one date with each of your kids at least monthly.</li>
  <li>Include the children in planning the family vacation, including the budget.</li>
  <li>Be willing to say no to inappropriate requests. This teaches your child respects for the
    needs of others.</li>
  <li>A long-term focus mean being committed to your child&#146;s needs, not simply his wants.
    Say yes when you can and no when you must.</li>
  <li>Affirm your children&#146;s individuality within the context of community. Affirm how
    they are unique, but connect that distinctive with their contribution to the
    &quot;team&quot; &amp; eventually the community.</li>
  <li>Enforce consequences to not forgo necessary discipline. Discipline is the deliberate
    creation of stress to help your child grow &amp; learn. Don&#146;t be afraid of the added
    stress.</li>
  <li>If your children misbehave in restaurants or grocery stores, take away a privilege. Next
    time, come prepared to play a game to help entertain them. Ask for a kid&#146;s menu. Have
    him hunt for certain objects in each store aisle. Remind him to behave so he won&#146;t
    lose his privilege again.</li>
  <li>If your children fight over the front seat, assign the seat a month at a time.</li>
  <li>Have family reading hours. Don&#146;t answer the phone &amp; have a snack while you
    read.</li>
  <li>Restrict TV watching. Let your child earn more by doing a chore, exercising or reading.
    Track with a chart by the TV.</li>
  <li>Remind your children that you love them even when they don&#146;t live up to your
    expectations. After discipling children, sometimes a note expressing this can be helpful.</li>
  <li>If they are on the phone too much, set a daily limit &amp; stick to it.</li>
  <li>Have a written driving agreement with your teenager. The use of a car is a privilege,
    not a right. Car use is tied to caring for car &amp; possibly grades.</li>
  <li>If your child is pushing the limits, select 2 or 3 behaviors you want to change the
    most. Let your child know &amp; the consequences &amp; let the others slide.</li>
  <li>Be willing to risk unpopularity with your child when you won&#146;t compromise the
    standards &amp; impose consequences.</li>
  <li>Understanding the trends in childhood may help us understand our own child. Try to read
    a magazine or newspaper article that deals with trends in kids weekly.</li>
  <li>Each year, hand over a new area of responsibility to your children.</li>
  <li>Giving kids too much is giving them too little. Write a plan for when to give major
    gifts.</li>
  <li>Model for your child what you want to see in him.</li>
  <li>More freedom is given as it is responsibly earned.</li>
  <li>Model your faith in front of your children.</li>
  <li>Do service projects together.</li>
  <li>Be willing to let go of your children &amp; prepare them to leave home.</li>
  <li>Include your children in your daily activities. Introduce them, send the message that
    you are proud of them.</li>
  <li>Listen to your child. Learn when they like to talk &amp; make it happen.</li>
  <li>Encourage laughter.</li>
  <li>Write to your child. Funny cards, serious letters, kids love to get mail.</li>
  <li>Give you child a party. Show honor to your child by focusing on them.</li>
  <li>Show up at their activities, even practices show your love &amp; interest.</li>
  <li>Love yourself. Parenting is draining, model taking care of yourself. Breaks, exercise,
    prayer time, etc.</li>
  <li>Decide what your kid can do more of &amp; you can do less of then initiate your plan.</li>

<p><b><font FACE="Arial">Summary about book</font></b></p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">

<p>An awesome book, I would &amp; have recommended this book as reading for all parents. I
don&#146;t like the title, &quot;The Relaxed Parent&quot;, it gives me a
&quot;feeling&quot; of permissiveness which is not what it is about. It should be called
&quot;The Effective Parent&quot; or &quot;Principled Parenting&quot;. The other weakness
of this book is a lack of real life &amp; age appropriate examples of &quot;Principled
Parenting&quot;. I think this book is a great start, a great foundation to parenting
effectively (principled parenting) but give me some examples.</p>

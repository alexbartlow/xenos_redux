    <p style="letter-spacing: 0px"><i>Creation occurred by God's word:</i> &quot;by 
      the word of God the heavens existed long ago, &quot; (2 Pet 3:5) &quot;Let 
      there be light&quot;, &quot;Let there be an expanse&#133;,&quot; This is

      in Hebrews (4:12). </p>
  </li>
  <li><i>Changes thinking:</i> John 8:31-32, &quot;If you abide in my word, you

    set you free.&quot; It does this because the Word shows us the mind of Christ. 
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><i>Changes lives:</i> That&#146;s why Paul tells us God&#146;s word is &quot;profitable

    so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work,&quot; 
    (2 Tim 3:16).</li>

<p>Introduction to Inductive Method: </p>
</b><i> 
<p>Art vs. Science</p>
</i> 
<blockquote> 
  <p>People want a cut and dry method to extract meaning from God&#146;s word 
    as though they were following a manual for building a deck. The problem is 
    God&#146;s word isn&#146;t designed this way. There is no manual; there are 
    only guidelines. This is because interpretation isn&#146;t a science. There 
    are methods we can follow to help us come to right conclusions but methods 
    will only get us part of the way there. There is an art to interpreting the 
    Bible. It requires skill, finesse, insight, and the power of the Holy Spirit. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <p>(2 Peter 1:20,21) But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture 
    is <i>a matter</i> of one's own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made 
    by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.</p>
  <p>Class exercises are a dynamic process. I don&#146;t have all the answers; 
    rather, I gain insight from your approach as well. You may feel overwhelmed 
    at the beginning; hang in there.</p>
</blockquote>
<b> 
<p>Approaching a book for study</p>
</b><i> 
<p>Preliminary assessment: What kind of book is this? </p>
</i> 
<blockquote> 
  <p>Biblical interpretation really begins with a thorough understanding of the 
    Bible as a whole. But we gain that understanding bit by bit. No one starts 
    out interpreting the Bible with a full-blown knowledge of all its parts. While 
    it is true that the Bible builds upon itself and that later revelation often 
    refers to what was written earlier, much of the New Testament was written 
    to those who were not entirely biblically literate. Much of the NT is simplified 
    and explained for us because it is largely written with a Gentile audience 
    in mind. </p>
  <p>You have already answered a few questions as you begin to use this worksheet. 
    You&#146;ve decided that this book is a letter or an epistle. What&#146;s 
    the difference? An epistle is a kind of letter, but whereas a letter is usually 
    written to a specific individual, such as Timothy, an epistle is written to 
    a wider audience, such as the church in Galatia. But the most important thing 
    to understand is that this kind of writing is occasional. By that we mean 
    that there were specific circumstances which brought about the writing of 
    this letter. It is written by an individual at a certain time and place usually 
    in response to some event, question or occasion that has presented itself. 
    For instance, the epistle to the Galatians is written in response to pressing 
    concerns about harmful influences in the church. If we discern what situation 
    occasioned the writing of the epistle we&#146;re studying, we&#146;ve gone 
    a long way toward understanding the meaning of the book we&#146;re studying.</p>
  <p>Because Ephesians is an epistle you&#146;ve answered another question as 
    to where it is situated within God&#146;s redemptive plan. It is clearly after 
    the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ and is written to help us understand 
    more fully the meaning of those events and apply them to daily life. </p>
  <p><i>Epistles:</i> unique challenges/characteristics </p>
  <p><i>Terse:</i> As opposed to narrative. <br>
    <i>Occasional:</i> What's the occasion?<br>
    <i>Audience Specific: </i>It wasn&#146;t written to us directly. That doesn&#146;t 
    mean that it doesn&#146;t apply to us or that Paul didn&#146;t have in mind 
    the universal church when he wrote. </p>

  Study Worksheet: Epistles</font></b></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><b>Overview Summary </b></font></p>
<font FACE="Arial"> 
<blockquote> 
  <p>Summarize situation:</p>
  <p><i>Author, Audience, Third Party </i></p>
  <p><i>Themes</i></p>
  <p><i>Summary</i></p>
  <i> 
  <p>General Overview: Read through the book completely</p>
  </i> </blockquote>
<i> 
<p>The logic of beginning with overview: </p>
</i> 
<blockquote> 
  <p>The purpose of beginning by reading the entire book is that it gives you 
    an understanding of where the author is heading. Once you know where the author 
    is going, you&#146;ll have a better understanding of how he builds his argument. 
    Without getting a sense of the whole we tend to misuse the parts. We cannot 
    really understand the parts of a text in isolation from each other. This is 
    the error of proof-texting or wrenching a passage out of its context and applying 
    it to a situation. (Example: James 2:14,24 &quot;What use is it, my brethren, 
    if a man says he has faith, but he has not works? Can that faith save him? 
    &#133;You see that a man justified by works, and not by faith alone.&quot; 
    Luther's response. Passage hinges on &quot;justification.&quot;) If we have 
    not taken the time to understand the context, we will be guilty of this error 
    by default. However, if we have taken the time to attempt to understand the 
    whole, our ability to understand the parts will be greatly enhanced. </p>
</blockquote>
<i> 
<p>Inductive-deductive Approach</p>
</i> </font> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><font FACE="Arial">In order to understand a specific passage of scripture 
    we need to see the broader context. We call this the inductive-deductive approach 
    to understand scripture. It is really just a reflection of how understanding 
    occurs in general; that is, we tend to see the parts in terms of the whole. 
    And we understand the whole as made up of various parts. When we approach 
    the biblical interpretation in this way it allows us to have a system of checks 
    and balances. The way this works is that we read a passage such as 1 John 
    3:6:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;No one who abides in Him sins; no one who sins has seen Him or knows 
    Him.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> <font FACE="Arial"> 
  <p>Those who want to prove that Christians no longer sin have used this passage. 
    When we read this passage we may immediately question our salvation in Christ 
    because our experience does not conform to this passage. We could waste a 
    lot of time trying to interpret this passage out of its context. It is only 
    when we are able to see the entire scope of John's epistle and attempt to 
    harmonize this passage with the rest of his letter that we gain any clarity 
    on what he is saying. So what has happened is that we have reasoned from the 
    bottom up (what does this passage say) and from the top down (what does the 
    rest of the book say: does our understanding of the theme fit the individual 
    passages). We put together the whole in terms of the parts and the parts in 
    terms of the whole. </p>
  </font> </blockquote>
<font FACE="Arial"> 
<p><i>Historical context: Author, audience, and third party</i></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Read the book, noting every time the author is mentioned, every time the 
    audience or readers are mentioned and every time anyone else is mentioned&#151;we 
    call them the third party. This third party is not who the letter is directed 
    towards but they often figure prominently in why the letter was written. We 
    identify parties in the letter in order to understand what historical circumstances 
    motivated the author&#146;s communication. Behind this method is an assumption 
    about the nature of epistles which we&#146;ve already mentioned, that is that 
    epistles are occasional documents, they were written to address a specific 
    situation on a specific occasion. </p>
  <p>Who is the third party in Galatians?</p>
</blockquote>
<i> 
<p>Hints: 
</i> 
<ul>
  <li><em>Ask questions of the epistle as you read.</em></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The secret of good interpretation comes by asking questions of the text, 
    such as: What concerned the author as he wrote? What sorts of error had the 
    readers fallen into? Are there any other groups or people being mentioned 
    by the author that the letter is not specifically addressed to? Why does the 
    author take the tone or approach that he does? What is motivating the author 
    and what does he want to see changed in his audience? </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Read Ephesians in class; divide into paragraphs</li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p>(GFX)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><i>Conclude by stating the major themes of letter including the author&#146;s 
    primary reasons for writing.</i> </li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p>What are the major themes of this letter and how is it organized? Identify 
    words or ideas that are repeated or emphasized by the author. This will be 
    an important guiding principle for further interpretation. It will serve as 
    a guidepost and key to help you understand passages in the letter that may 
    be obscure. Notice that we built our controlling theme based on our understanding 
    of the individual passages of the book. And we will use this theme to better 
    understand parts of the book that are more difficult. But we may find as we 
    begin to take a closer look at specific passages that our understanding of 
    a word or concept was incorrect and our new understanding may lead us to have 
    to reformulate what we have identified as the controlling theme of the book. 
    This kind of back-and-forth approach from the parts to the whole and vice 
    versa is healthy and it allows us to have a dynamic understanding of the book 
    that can be challenged by new information. This allows us to have a growing 
    understanding about the meaning of a book and keeps us from being blinded 
    by our preconceived ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <i>Themes:</i> Ephesians Intro </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Ephesians is a book that could change your life. It is one of the few books 
    that encapsulates the gospel message in its entirety. Survive with this book 
    alone. </p>
  <p>There is a strong emphasis on the privileged position we enjoy in Christ; 
    God's love for us; a contrast between our old way of life and our new way 
    of life.</p>
</blockquote>
<i> 
<p>Why was this letter written?</p>
</i> 
<blockquote> 
  <p>The point of this overview is to understand why the letter was written, who 
    wrote it and to whom. Write a paragraph summarizing your understanding of 
    the historical circumstances to this point. Leave space in your workbook to 
    add to or modify this material as your understanding of the book grows. Why 
    was this letter written? </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Paragraph Study</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Who makes the paragraphs? Unfortunately, paragraphs are not a part of the 
    original manuscripts. The Greeks wrote without paragraph breaks, without sentence 
    breaks and even without word breaks! Translators have added these divisions 
    for us and because of that, the paragraph divisions and even the sentence 
    divisions within your Bibles are not infallible. </p>
  <p>In order to save time, for this class we will use my paragraph divisions. 
    As you go through my paragraph divisions to do your inductive studies, you 
    may disagree with how I&#146;ve divided up the book. That&#146;s fine. You 
    can use your own as long as you can make a convincing argument that your way

<p><i>Paragraph Study</i>:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Carefully read the paragraph in an attempt to understand the following points. 
    This part of the study is always done in reference to the larger understanding 
    of the book. </p>
</blockquote>
<b> 
<p>Structure: Skeleton. </p>
</b> 
<blockquote> 
  <p>The goal here is to clarify the development of the author's thoughts or argument. 
    The structure of an author&#146;s writing functions like a body&#146;s skeleton. 
    It is unseen when you look at the surface. And yet, it provides the framework 
    that in large part determines the shape and size of the body. Of course, it&#146;s 
    not the only determining factor in the way a person looks. Attached to the 
    skeleton is muscle tissue&#151;content&#151;that drives the movement of the 
    structure. Covering both the skeleton and muscular tissue is the skin&#151;application&#151;that 
    gives final shape to the body. The skin is what gives final form to the biblical 
    structure and content and it is what we see of a person day-to-day. But it 
    is a reflection of the underlying content/musculature and skeletal structure. 
  </p>
  <p><i></i>The structure of a book or a paragraph is generally unseen by the 
    reader until he or she begins to dissect what is being said. The importance 
    in this is that once you begin to recognize the structure, you will better 
    understand how things fit together. How does the author organize what he wants 
    to communicate? The way he organizes his statements will emphasize certain 
    points while subordinating others. This is important for us because we want 
    to emphasize what the writer emphasizes. This usually becomes clear as we 
    see how an author puts together his thoughts. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>A. Context: literary &amp; theological</i> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>What are the ideas or themes communicated before and after your paragraph? 
    Where is the author coming from and where is he going? How does this passage 
    fit into the broader context and argument of the book you are studying? </p>
  <p><br>
    Where is the author going with the point that&#146;s being made in the passage 
    you are studying? Is there a break in thought between what occurred previously 
    and what occurs afterward? If so, why? Becoming a good interpreter means being 
    able to see the flow or logic of the text. To use the analogy of the structure 
    of a passage as a skeletal framework, this means being able to see how the 
    bones connect with in your passage and which bones they connect to before 
    and after your passage. </p>
</blockquote>
<i> 
<p>B. Main Point: What is the central claim of this passage?</p>
</i> 
<blockquote> 
  <p>In order to understand a paragraph we need to know what is the central idea 
    or theme of the paragraph. Ask <i>What</i>. What does the author want his 
    readers to understand or what does the author want his readers to do? </p>
</blockquote>
<i> 
<p>Hints: 
<ul>
  <li>Identify Conclusions:</li>
</ul>
</i> 
<blockquote> 
  <p>Conclusions are generally <i>indicated by words like: </i>thus, therefore, 
    so, so that, hence, then, consequently. &quot;Therefore&quot; or &quot;for 
    this reason&quot; often indicates the author&#146;s main point. Circle these 
    kinds of words that indicate that the author is drawing a conclusion. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><i>Identify Imperatives</i>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p>An imperative is a command. Often, <b>but not always</b>, in the epistles 
    the main point of a passage is found in the imperative statements. The author 
    is instructing his readers to do a certain activity or to think in a specific 
    way. What is the author telling his audience to do? </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><i>Identify a controlling idea:</i></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Sometimes a passage doesn&#146;t include an imperative or doesn&#146;t have 
    a conclusion indicator. Ask yourself what is the controlling idea of the passage. 
    What universal truth or overarching idea accounts for all of the elements 
    of the passage? What brings it all together? </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><i>Identify independent clauses:</i></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The main point will be contained in the part of the sentence that can stand 
    on its own. It may not be a full sentence as it is written but it could be. 
    A dependent clause is one that cannot stand alone as a sentence. It is by 
    definition a modifying statement put there to give support or give clarification 
    to the main clause. (Review the sentences in 1:14 to identify dependent versus 
    independent clauses.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>C. Supporting points. How is the main point supported?</i></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>In other words, why is the claim true and why should the reader do what the 
    author says?</p>
  <p>You&#146;ve already discerned what the main point of the passage is, now 
    you want to identify how the author backs up that point. What theological 
    basis or principles are given by the author to support his claim? Or what 
    illustrations does he use to support his point? In this section we are mostly 
    asking questions about <i>Why</i>. Why does he want them to do what he tells 
    them to do? Why do they need to understand this information? Why is it important 
    to their Christian lives? This is a key question for which we need answers. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><i>List out the supporting points.</i></strong></p>
<i> 
<p>Hints: 
<ul>
  <li>Identify indicatives:</li>
</ul>
</i> 
<blockquote> 
  <p>Indicatives are statements that claim to be true. They are often the basis 
    for an imperative. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><i>Identify connective words:</i></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Connective words link a supporting idea to a main idea. They tell us the 
    reason behind the central claim of a passage. Connective words are words such 
    as: because, for, since, as, for this purpose, so that, in order that (1Pet4:6). 
    These connective words connect to one of two kinds of statements: indicative 
    statements or result clauses. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><i>Identify result statements</i>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p>These statements indicate the kind of results the author wants to see or 
    wants to warn us about. It is not necessarily an indicative but it is the 
    outcome sought or hoped for. In Galatians 3:24, as we have seen Paul concludes 
    a section on the purpose of the law with &quot;Therefore the Law has become 
    our tutor to lead us to Christ. . .&quot; He finishes this statement with 
    the result that the Law is intended to bring about, namely, &quot;so that 
    we may be justified by faith.&quot; Again, in Galatians 5:16-24 Paul tells 
    his audience to &quot;walk by the Spirit,&quot; which is his main point. He 
    backs up his claim by showing his readers the results of walking in the spirit 
    as well as showing them the antithesis, which is walking according to the 
    flesh. The desired outcome, or its antithesis, helps answer the question of 
    why we should do what the author is telling us. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><i>Identify Illustrations/Examples</i>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Sometimes the author gives an illustration or example to support his main 
    point. Paul does this in Galatians by using Abraham as an example of the principle 
    that righteousness is by faith. In 3:6 he tells the Galatians, &quot;Even 
    so Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.&quot; 
    Paul uses Abraham as an example of the principle he&#146;s trying to communicate. 
    Whenever the author quotes Scriptures, he is citing an illustration or example. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><i>Content/ Theology:</i> Muscle </b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>In this section we are not as concerned with how something is said or organized 
    as we are with <b>what is said</b>. This is what we normally think of as interpretation. 
    Think again of the passage as a body. The structure or the way the body is 
    put together is the skeletal framework. The muscle that hangs on the skeleton 
    is its content. As we&#146;ve gone through identifying the structure of the 
    passage, we&#146;ve also done some of the work in examining the content. In 
    identifying connective words and supporting ideas, we are examining the structure. 
    When we ask what or to whom those ideas or words refer and what they mean, 
    we are examining the content. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> <i>Hints</i>: 
<ul>
  <li><i>Identify important words and phrases</i></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p>In this part of our study, we will want to gain clarity on exactly what is 
    being said and what it means. One way that we do this is by clarifying important 
    or unfamiliar words. It is easy to get bogged down in word studies because 
    nearly every word seems interesting. Be selective in the words you choose 
    to study, usually one to three words in any passage is sufficient. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><i>Unfamiliar words: </i></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p>If you&#146;re unfamiliar with a word, maybe you&#146;ve never seen the word 
    before or maybe you&#146;ve just never heard a good definition for it, take 
    the time to look it up in a good Bible dictionary. You may be surprised at 
    the rewards you reap by clarifying unfamiliar words. <br>
    If you're studying Galatians chapter three you may wonder what exactly Paul 
    means by the word &quot;blessed.&quot; This is a word that Paul draws from 
    the Old Testament text but it is also a word that Jesus uses. With a relatively 
    small amount of work you can discover that when Paul says &quot;So then those 
    who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the believer&quot; he is referring 
    to much more than an emotional state. The word is used of the gift that would 
    come to the Gentiles through Abraham's willingness to be used by God. It is 
    a theologically loaded term that finds its fulfillment in Jesus Christ. Paul 
    is saying that faith produces the righteousness of Abraham. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><i>Strategically important words: </i></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p>One way to determine if a word is important is if it&#146;s emphasized or 
    repeated by the author. In studying the book of Romans the word <i>justification</i> 
    appears numerous times and in many different forms. If we are to understand 
    the meaning of the book of Romans, <i>justification</i> would be an important 
    concept to understand. </p>
  <p>Another way that we decide the importance of a word is based on the role 
    it plays in the author&#146;s thought. Does the paragraph or sentence we&#146;re 
    studying somehow hinge on an understanding of this word? </p>
  <p>After you&#146;ve studied the important or unfamiliar words, how does your 
    new-found appreciation for this word contribute to your understanding of the 
    passage. Eventually we&#146;ll also want to ask how it affects our understanding 
    of the book. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><i>Identify theological/historical contexts</i> </li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p>As you think about theological or historical contexts, think about the big 
    picture. What other passages talk about these issues? What other passages 
    might be relevant to the passage you are studying? Do other scriptures speak 
    to the same issues that your passage addresses? </p>
  <p>Does the author quote from Scripture or refer to an historical event? If 
    so, what purpose does he quote for? It is important to always look up the 
    passage being quoted in its original context.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <p>.<img SRC="image2.gif" WIDTH="566" HEIGHT="514"> <br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <p>This is the place to clarify or research historical or geographic references 
    with which you are unfamiliar. A good Bible dictionary is helpful in this 
    regard and will often provide insights into the text that you would otherwise 
    miss.</p>
  <p>Look up quotations from the Old Testament that the author uses. What is the 
    context of the original statement and how does the original context bear on 
    the author&#146;s meaning? Why does the author say what he does? If the author 
    gives an imperative without providing a theological reason, it is important 
    to ask what is the theological or cultural basis for the command. We have 
    looked at how he says it and what he says, but it also important to ask why 
    he says it. The &quot;why&quot; is often rooted in the nature of God. </p>
</blockquote>
<b> 
<p>Application: Skin </p>
</b> 
<p><em>How is the argument of the passage intended to affect the original audience 
  in terms of actions, attitudes and convictions? </em></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Let's recall the main point of the passage. If there is an imperative in 
    the passage, what is author calling on his audience to do? The desired effects 
    may be spelled out plainly by the author but it is important to pause and 
    ask how the application relates to the historical situation of the audience. 
    If the author is telling them to do something is it because they weren't doing 
    it at the time? How would their circumstances relate to what they were or 
    were not doing? </p>
</blockquote>
<i> 
<p>What similarities exist between the original audience and myself or my audience?</p>
</i> 
<blockquote> 
  <p>Before we can move to asking how this passage applies to my audience, or 
    to myself, we need to examine the similarities between our situation and that 
    of the original audience. (The analogy of skin is appropriate here because 
    as circumstances and cultures change the application of a biblical principle 
    will take on different manifestations. However, what does not change is the 
    underlying structure of the author's argument--skeleton--and theological content--musculature. 
    In fact, this underlying framework will determine the shape that our application 
    takes in a given context. To carry this analogy further, what we want to avoid 
    is introducing a layer of fat that distorts the theological shape and results 
    in a culturally misappropriate application.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Is the passage directly applicable to my audience because we are in the 
  same situation as the original audience or is it only applicable in principle? 
  </em></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The reason we ask this question is because epistles are occasional documents, 
    the writers are in the process of applying truths to specific life circumstances. 
    Because our circumstances may differ from the original audience&#146;s, we 
    cannot necessarily make a one-to-one correlation. Epistles can be considered 
    &quot;case studies&quot; which apply biblical principles to specific situations 
    (Ericson, <i>LMS</i>, p 250); in as much as our current situation mirrors 
    that of the original audience, we can apply the passage directly. </p>
  <p>But when our circumstances differ significantly, we often need to work from 
    the principle being given in order to apply it to our situation. </p>
  <i> 
  <p>Examples: Eph 5:18 drunk with wine/head-covering</p>
  </i> </blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Why is it that most women do not wear headcoverings in the church today even 
    though Paul explicitly commands it? The reason has to do with cultural relevance. 
    Paul was giving a practical expression of a spiritual truth, namely that we 
    should&#151;in this case women should&#151;respect authority. The principle 
    of authority (1 Cor. 11:3) is tied to a spiritual truth but the way that this 
    respect is shown is in keeping with the cultural norms. 1Cor. 11:5,14, Paul 
    is telling the church specifically not to go against cultural norms in expressing 
    this principle of submission to authority. However, outward expression of 
    this principle in dress or manner is no longer relevant today because it is 
    not something our culture practices and yet the biblical principle remains 
    true and should find expression in the attitudes and interactions between 
    a husband and a wife.</p>
</blockquote>
<i> 
<p>How is the intent of this passage relevant to my audience or myself? </p>
</i> 
<blockquote> 
  <p>Recall what the main point of the passage is. It is important to apply what 
    the text meant to apply; often this is found in an imperative statement. </p>
  <p>To what life issues does the passage speak? Think of specific situations 
    in which this passage or its principle would apply in your life and be as 
    specific as possible. We often limit our thinking to theological truths contained 
    in the passage and then fail to apply the obvious imperatives contained in 
    God&#146;s word.</p>

    13. &#149; Did God choose only those who would respond? &#149; Did God choose 
    without regard to our response? &#149; Did God choose more generally (church: 
    Jews &amp; Gentiles) and our response decides whether we are included in that 
    group? We don&#146;t know the answers to these questions. We do know that 
    we have been chosen in God somehow and yet it is also somehow dependent on 
    our willingness to respond to the message.)<br>

<blockquote> 
  <p>Meditating on all that God has given us, in specific detail, will produce 
    gratitude and praise toward God. And a natural result of this would be to 
    live our lives for His glory (but that&#146;s getting ahead of our author.) 
    Paul is content to simply spend some time praising God. </p>
  <p>Know what&#146;s true of us has real-life value. Meditate on these things! 
  </p>
  <p>God had us--He had you--in mind when he created the universe. He had determined 
    to redeem a people to Himself before He ever laid the foundations of the world. 
    And He knew that we would be a part of that. <br>
    He chose to adopt us. He chose too buy us out of slavery--not to sin, primarily--but 
    to death, to redeem and forgive us. He didn't have to do this. He wasn't obligated 
    to redeem a rebellious and obstinate and thoroughly hateful people. But He 
    did. </p>
  <p>And beyond that He revealed to us His will. He made Himself known so that 
    we wouldn't be in darkness, so that we wouldn't be worshipping the gods of 
    the skies for rain or fertility. He revealed Himself so that we wouldn't be 
    worshipping in futility, hoping that somehow we might appease Him--that we 
    might figure out exactly what he wants so that we can avoid His anger.</p>
  <p>Beyond all of this, He's given us an inheritance in the spiritual realm. 
    I recently came into an inheritance from my Grandmother, which was a nice 
    surprise. I knew I'd get a few hundred dollars. As it turned out, it was much 
    more than I expected. I was shocked. God's inheritance will be so much more. 
    But it is there and it is waiting for me. And it is something I can be certain 
    of because God has sealed me in Christ with His Holy Spirit. It is the Spirit 
    of God that holds me firmly in place. As a young believer, I feared that I 
    might let go of God. I failed to realize how strong is God's grip on me. It's 
    not just me walking through this life, making my decisions, God's Spirit moves 
    inside me and holds me close to Himself.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Praise God! </p>
  <p>How do you respond to &quot;Praise God&quot;? Get used to it, Rev 4. God 
    is awesome. This is a worthy goal of a teaching. If you could do no more than 
    inspire people to praise God for all he's done, I'd consider that successful.

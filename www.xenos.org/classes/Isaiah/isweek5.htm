biblical book, this one reveals the name and the nature of the God who invites us to be

terrible, he dwells with the lowly and contrite. He is faithful, he is forgiving, he
demands perfection. He is passionate, both in loving right and hating evil. He calls us to
lay aside our independence and trust in him, for he has chosen us and redeemed us in

        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">49:14-16 But Zion said, &quot;The LORD has forsaken me, And
        the Lord has forgotten me.&quot; &quot;Can a woman forget her nursing child, And have no
        compassion on the son of her womb? Even these may forget, but I will not forget you.
        &quot;Behold, I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands; Your walls are continually
        before Me.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">54:5-8 &quot;For your husband is your Maker, Whose name is
        the LORD of hosts; And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel, Who is called the God of
        all the earth. &quot;For the LORD has called you, Like a wife forsaken and grieved in
        spirit, Even like a wife of one's youth when she is rejected,&quot; Says your God.
        &quot;For a brief moment I forsook you, But with great compassion I will gather you.
        &quot;In an outburst of anger I hid My face from you for a moment; But with everlasting
        lovingkindness I will have compassion on you,&quot; Says the LORD your Redeemer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Isaiah and the Promises of God</b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">When we examine God's actions in human history, they are
best appreciated in the context of his plans and thus his promises. It is for this reason
that this book can best be understood in the context of the Davidic and Abrahamic
covenants. </font></p>

<p><u><font face="Arial" size="3">The Terms of the Covenants </font></p>
</u>

<blockquote>
  <b><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Abrahamic Covenant </font></p>
  </b>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <b><p></b><font face="Arial" size="3">Gen 12:1-3 Now the LORD said to Abram, &quot;Go
  forth from your country, And from your relatives And from your father's house, To the land
  which I will show you; And I will make you a great nation, And I will bless you, And make
  your name great; And so you shall be a blessing; And I will bless those who bless you, And
  the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all the families of the earth shall be
  blessed.&quot; (c.f. 15:1-21 for the cutting of the covenant) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">This promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed
  through him was almost 1400 years past at this time. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<b>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Davidic Covenant</b> </font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">2 Samuel 7:4-16 That night the word of the Lord came to
  Nathan, saying: &quot;Go and tell my servant David...(9) I will make your name
  great...(10) I will provide a place for my people Israel...so that they can have a home of
  their own and no longer be disturbed...(11) I will also give you rest from all your
  enemies...(I) will establish a house for you...(12) I will raise up your offspring to
  succeed you...I will establish his kingdom. (13,16) Your house and your kingdom will
  endure forever before me; your throne will be established forever. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Psalm 89:3f; 26ff You said, &quot;I have made a covenant
  with my chosen one, I have sworn to David my servant, (4) 'I will establish your line
  forever and make your throne firm through all generations.' (28) and my covenant will
  never fail. (29) I will establish his line forever, his throne as long as the heavens
  endure. (30f) [discipline for his son's if they sin] (34) I will not violate my covenant
  or alter what my lips have uttered...(36) that his line will continue forever and his
  throne endure before me like the sun...&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Psalm 132:11-18 The Lord swore an oath to David, a sure
  oath that he will not revoke: &quot;One of your own descendants I will place on your
  throne-if your sons keep my covenant and the statutes I teach them, then their sons will
  sit on your throne for ever and ever.&quot;....... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Just under three centuries before Isaiah's ministry, God
  made a promise to the king of Israel, David<sup><a NAME="Ref1"></a><a HREF="#Note1">[1]</a></sup>. He promised several things but one of the more
  startling was that David would be the father of a lineage that would produce Israeli kings
  forever. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Three hundred years after the promise, at a time when the
  entire nation seemed to be spiraling toward oblivion and just prior to events that would
  make the most ardent believer begin to doubt, God reminded them of that promise and began
  to explain more fully what it meant. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The salient features of this contract between God and David
  are partly unilateral and partly bilateral and include the following:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Unilateral features</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">David will be a very successful leader of Israel and will
      finally have peace </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">David's son will be the next in an eternal dynasty of
      Israeli kings (2Sam.7:13,16; Ps.89:4,29,36; Ps.132:12) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Israel will have a land of its own (2Sam.7:10) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Bilateral features - Any Davidic king that disobeys God
    will be disciplined by God (2Sam.7:14; Ps.89:30-33) even to the extent that a particular
    Davidic lineage may be disallowed from the dynastic covenant (Ps.132:12) </font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><u>Isaiah's Revelation</u>: <u>The Abrahamic &amp; Davidic
Covenants Will Converge Upon the Messiah </u></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">An Eternal &quot;Anointed One&quot; Will Fulfill the
  Davidic Covenant. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Isaiah 9:6-7 For unto us a child is born, to us a son is
  given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful
  Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace, Of the increase of his
  government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on David's throne and over his
  kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on
  and forever. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Isaiah 11:1-10 Then a shoot will spring from the stem of
  Jesse, And a branch from his roots will bear fruit. And the Spirit of the LORD will rest
  on Him, The spirit of wisdom and understanding, The spirit of counsel and strength, The
  spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD. And He will delight in the fear of the LORD,
  And He will not judge by what His eyes see, Nor make a decision by what His ears hear; But
  with righteousness He will judge the poor, And decide with fairness for the afflicted of
  the earth; And He will strike the earth with the rod of His mouth, And with the breath of
  His lips He will slay the wicked. Also righteousness will be the belt about His loins, And
  faithfulness the belt about His waist. And the wolf will dwell with the lamb, And the
  leopard will lie down with the kid, And the calf and the young lion and the fatling
  together; And a little boy will lead them. Also the cow and the bear will graze; Their
  young will lie down together; And the lion will eat straw like the ox. And the nursing
  child will play by the hole of the cobra, And the weaned child will put his hand on the
  viper's den. They will not hurt or destroy in all My holy mountain, For the earth will be
  full of the knowledge of the LORD As the waters cover the sea. Then it will come about in
  that day That the nations will resort to the root of Jesse, Who will stand as a signal for
  the peoples; And His resting place will be glorious. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">[See also, Micah 5:1-5, a contemporary of Isaiah] </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">A Servant of God Will Fulfill the Abrahamic Covenant (c.f.
  Gen.12:1-3) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Isaiah 42:1, 6 &quot;Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my
  chosen one in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him and he will bring justice to the
  nations....(6) I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people and a
  light for the Gentiles, to open eyes that are blind, to free captives from prison and to
  release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Isaiah 49:5-8 And now says the LORD, who formed Me from the
  womb to be His Servant, To bring Jacob back to Him, in order that Israel might be gathered
  to Him...He says, &quot;It is too small a thing that You should be My Servant To raise up
  the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved ones of Israel; I will also make You a
  light of the nations So that My salvation may reach to the end of the earth.&quot; Thus
  says the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and its Holy One, To the despised One, To the One
  abhorred by the nation, To the Servant of rulers, &quot;Kings shall see and arise, Princes
  shall also bow down; Because of the LORD who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel who has
  chosen You.&quot; Thus says the LORD, &quot;In a favorable time I have answered You, And
  in a day of salvation I have helped You; And I will keep You and give You for a covenant
  of the people, To restore the land, to make them inherit the desolate heritages; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Isaiah 50:6-7; 51:2 I gave My back to those who strike Me,
  And My cheeks to those who pluck out the beard; I did not cover My face from humiliation
  and spitting. For the Lord GOD helps Me, Therefore, I am not disgraced; ...&quot;Look to
  Abraham your father, And to Sarah who gave birth to you in pain; When he was one I called
  him, Then I blessed him and multiplied him.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Isaiah 52:7 How lovely on the mountains Are the feet of him
  who brings good news, Who announces peace And brings good news of happiness, Who announces
  salvation, And says to Zion, &quot;Your God reigns!&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Isaiah 52:13-53:12 Behold, My servant will prosper, He will
  be high and lifted up, and greatly exalted. Just as many were astonished at you, My
  people, So His appearance was marred more than any man, And His form more than the sons of
  men. Thus He will sprinkle many nations, Kings will shut their mouths on account of Him;
  ...Who has believed our message? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed? For He
  grew up before Him like a tender shoot, And like a root out of parched ground; He has no
  stately form or majesty That we should look upon Him, Nor appearance that we should be
  attracted to Him. He was despised and forsaken of men, A man of sorrows, and acquainted
  with grief; And like one from whom men hide their face, He was despised, and we did not
  esteem Him. Surely our griefs He Himself bore, And our sorrows He carried; Yet we
  ourselves esteemed Him stricken, Smitten of God, and afflicted. But He was pierced through
  for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our
  well-being fell upon Him, And by His scourging we are healed. All of us like sheep have
  gone astray, Each of us has turned to his own way; But the LORD has caused the iniquity of
  us all To fall on Him. He was oppressed and He was afflicted, Yet He did not open His
  mouth; Like a lamb that is led to slaughter, And like a sheep that is silent before its
  shearers, So He did not open His mouth. By oppression and judgment He was taken away; And
  as for His generation, who considered That He was cut off out of the land of the living,
  For the transgression of my people to whom the stroke was due? His grave was assigned with
  wicked men, Yet He was with a rich man in His death, Because He had done no violence, Nor
  was there any deceit in His mouth. But the LORD was pleased To crush Him, putting Him to
  grief; If He would render Himself as a guilt offering, He will see His offspring, He will
  prolong His days, And the good pleasure of the LORD will prosper in His hand. As a result
  of the anguish of His soul, He will see it and be satisfied; By His knowledge the
  Righteous One, My Servant, will justify the many, As He will bear their iniquities.
  Therefore, I will allot Him a portion with the great, And He will divide the booty with
  the strong; Because He poured out Himself to death, And was numbered with the
  transgressors; Yet He Himself bore the sin of many, And interceded for the transgressors. </font></p>

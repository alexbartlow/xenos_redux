  <dir>
    <p><i>Pray! </i>We are trying to do something that is not humanly possible: convict people
    of sin so they repent, transfer people from Satan's domain to God's kingdom, enable them
    to understand spiritual truths, impart vision for a life of service to God, etc. Truly,
    &quot;who is adequate for these things?&quot; If we only want to entertain, impart a few
    knowledge nuggets, teach a little moral philosophy, etc.--we need not pray. But since we
    are trying to accomplish that which requires the power of God, our teaching must be
    birthed and bathed in prayer. I pray mainly for:</p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Illumination: that God will grant me insight into 
    his truth, build a burden within me, show me how to arrange the teaching, 
    give me application and illustration, etc. 
    <li>Utterance: that God will empower what I say and the 
    way I say it so that people are deeply affected, and that he would grant me 
    extemporaneous utterance (on-the-spot insight and expression). 
    <li>Your audience: that God will draw the hungry people 
    (Christians and non-Christians) to the meeting, that his Spirit will arrest 
    their attention and convict them of their need to respond to him, that he 
    will use this teaching far beyond the teaching itself through tapes, use by 
    others, etc. 
    <li>Protection: from excessive distraction and accusation, from disrupting the meeting
      itself--but see next point&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p><i>Anticipate and prayerfully reject Satan&#146;s accusations.</i> This is the most
    oppressive thing about teaching. Those who teach seem to get this more regularly than
    others. You should pray for protection, but God has not promised to shield you from all
    attack, so learn how to handle it!</p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Satan will accuse <i>you</i> 
    (&quot;You can't teach;&quot; &quot;You don't understand this passage;&quot; &quot;You&#146;re a 
    hypocrite;&quot; &quot;You are disqualified because of your fear;&quot; etc.). Rely on 
    God&#146;s grace instead of your own righteousness or native ability 
    (2&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;12:9,10). If you are afraid, remember that it is not a sin 
    to be afraid (1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;2:3,4)--it is only a sin to let fear dictate 
    your choices. 
    <li>Satan will accuse <i>God&#146;s Word </i>(&quot;They already know this;&quot; &quot;This doesn&#146;t make sense;&quot; &quot;This is 
    irrelevant/stupid;&quot; etc.). Choose to trust the power of his Word 
    (Isa.&nbsp;55:10,11; Heb.&nbsp;4:12). 
    <li>Satan will accuse <i>your audience </i>(&quot;They don't care;&quot; &quot;They aren't
      interested in Christ,&quot; etc.). Pray that Christ will be exalted, and think especially
      of those who are relatively new and spiritually responsive. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>I have found no clear correlation between how I feel before I teach and how effective
        the teaching is. </p>
        <p>Realize that the attack will often not lift until you actually open your mouth. </p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p><i>Back up all important points with scripture.</i> Otherwise, you will appear to be
    speaking from your own authority. However:</p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Don&#146;t plan on turning to other passages unless they 
    are crucial to your teaching, because this disrupts flow and causes 
    confusion for new listeners. 
    <li>Don&#146;t say, &quot;You don&#146;t need to turn there.&quot; This arouses needless
      suspicion. Simply quote or paraphrase the passage with reference.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <i><p>Be sure you have both &quot;heat&quot; (burden and sufficient application) and
    &quot;light&quot; (adequate interpretation and explanation). </p>
    </i>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Teachings without &quot;heat&quot; are boring; teachings 
    without &quot;light&quot; are propagandistic and manipulative. 
    <li>Identify which of these you tend to neglect and correct for this.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p><i>Include humor.</i> Humor is an important feature of good teachings--Jesus was a
    master of it (see Matt.&nbsp;7:3-5). Why? It is insightful. It makes difficult learning
    easier to digest. It relieves tension after a super-convicting point. It destroys the
    stereotype that the Bible and Christianity are stuffy. It engages the audience and
    establishes the humanness of the speaker. However, consider these qualifications:</p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Use humor as &quot;spice,&quot; but never for the main course 
    (SANGUINES BEWARE!). 
    <li>Remember not to substitute humor for refutation (simply mocking the opposing view). You
      can poke fun along with refutation, but not instead of it (e.g., MOCKING PANTHEISM IN
      BASIC DOCTRINE CLASS).</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Use humor that is conducive to your personality. Apply this to working from tapes:
      imitate the content more than the style.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p><i>Plan on a good level of content per minute.</i> Do you have too much on one subject?
    If you are repetitive or slow, you will lose your audience&#146;s interest and even arouse
    aversion for patronizing them. Neither should you overestimate the theological knowledge
    of your audience. Be simple and concise. Good planning will enable you to be easy to
    understand even though you move at a brisk pace.</p>
    <p><i>Write out your entire teaching in outline form.</i> This ensures that you have
    thought through each point in detail, including transitions (<b>Col. 2:8-15 NOTES</b>).
    The goal is not to memorize your teaching, but to be thorough in your preparation. Be
    thoroughly prepared--but leave room for extemporaneous utterance.</p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Do sections at a time. Dive down and develop a 
    section in detail, then move back to get the big picture, then dive down 
    somewhere else, etc. 
    <li>Get your outline down far enough ahead of time that you aren't making changes under the
      wire. This produces a vicious circle of anxiety, decreased concentration, more anxiety,
      etc.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <i><p>Rehearse alone and with another experienced person.</p>
    </i>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>All new teachers should give their teachings to an 
    experienced teacher if possible. Remember: the goal is not to preserve your 
    ego, but to serve the people! 
    <li>I like to walk, pray and preach through sections at a time.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p><i>Keep your teaching notes to a minimum! </i>One side of an 8 x 5-inch sheet is enough
    (<b>Col.&nbsp;2:8-15 NOTES</b>). If you aren&#146;t sufficiently prepared, your notes
    won&#146;t help you. If, however, you are prepared, excessive notes can still hurt you
    because they distract you from communicating to your audience (EXAMPLES).</p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>The most they can do is jog your memory if you 
    blank out (SAFETY NET). 
    <li>I usually write them out as a final run-through of 
    the content.
    <b>
    <li>Try your section teaching without notes, or at 
    least stick them in the back of your Bible!
    </li></b>           
  </ul>
</ul>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>HOW LONG? 30 minutes is plenty for inexperienced teachers! Remember Eutychus
    (Acts&nbsp;20:9)--unless you can raise them from the dead, stop before they drop over!
    &quot;The mind can only absorb what the seat can endure.&quot;</p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>You can go longer if you are gifted, or if you use discussion.</li>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Look directly into the eyes of several people 
    around the room. Find responsive listeners, but don&#146;t focus exclusively on 
    them. Don't dodge the resistant faces. 
    <li>Ignore unresponsive body language, but respond to looks of confusion, excitement, etc.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

    <p><i>Voice</i> <b>(&quot;VOICE&quot; THROUGH &quot;DRESS&quot; ARE &quot;PICTURE
    FRAME&quot; ISSUES)</b></p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Your voice should be loud enough for the person 
    farthest away to hear comfortably. 
    <li>You should practice <b>variation</b> in <i>tone</i> (sharp or mellow), <i>pitch</i>
      (high or low), <i>rate</i> (fast or slow), and <i>volume</i> (loud and soft). Uniformity bores people or 
    wears them down. 
    <li>Use vivid words, and find effective ways to emphasize key words. Use pause, repetition
      or special gestures for emphasis of important statements. Listen to other effective
      teachers and imitate them, without losing your own personality.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>NOTE: <i>Practice</i> these things in normal conversations. This will make you a better
        teacher, and you&#146;ll be a more interesting conversationalist as well!</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <i><p>Gestures &amp; Posture</p>
    </i>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Don't slump or cower. Come across relaxed, but take 
    authority. 
    <li>Your gestures should be varied, appropriately aggressive, and undistracting (enhancing
      your content, not distracting from it)--not showy or over-dramatic. <b>Avoid drinking
      unless necessary</b>. 
    <li>Your facial expressions should express the full 
    range of emotion: anger, surprise, delight, irony, pathos, compassion, etc. 
    <li>Lecterns, coffee tables, etc. should be avoided in home group teachings. They introduce
      more formality and distance between you and your audience, and they encourage more notes. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>NOTE: Identify your tendency in this area and correct for it. Those who tend to be
        passive communicators should push to the point of feeling uncomfortably aggressive. Those
        who tend to be aggressive should be sure they include appropriate grace, qualifications,
        encouragement, etc.</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p><i>Dress</i> should be undistracting to the audience--avoid excessive sloppiness or
    formality.</p>
    <p><i>Never disqualify yourself as a teacher or your content.</i> Statements like,
    &quot;I&#146;m not very good at this,&quot; or &quot;This is not a very good outline&quot;
    needlessly compromise the opportunity to impact your audience, and deflate your own
    confidence. You are teaching God's Word and you are God's spokesman!</p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>However, you should be careful to distinguish between your own opinion and God's Word.
      You should also acknowledge the complexity of certain issues.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p><i>Speak both as a fellow-learner/sinner and as a prophet.</i> Somehow, you should
    communicate that you have much to learn and a long way to go in your own walk with God.
    This helps people to identify with you and is a way of communicating God&#146;s grace. But
    having done this, you also need to boldly proclaim God&#146;s Word and call on people (as
    God&#146;s mouthpiece) to respond to it. </p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Your use of personal pronouns is important in 
    achieving this balance. &quot;We&quot; and &quot;I&quot; are usually appropriate in speaking as 
    a fellow-learner. &quot;You&quot; is often most appropriate in speaking as God&#146;s 
    spokesperson. 
    <li>Normally, you should speak <i>more</i> as a fellow-learner/sinner than as a prophet.
      Also, you should normally speak as a fellow-learner <i>before</i> speaking as a prophet.
      And when you use yourself as an illustration, it should often be of your errors and sins
      rather than of your victories.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p><i>Be sensitive to the non-Christian and the new Christian.</i> Keep them in mind in
    every part of your teaching preparation. </p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Avoid saying things like &quot;I'm sure you all know that passage .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;
      They do <i>not</i> know 
    it and will feel intimidated by this statement. 
    <li>Avoid undefined &quot;Christianese&quot;&#151;Christian jargon or 
    biblical terms with which new people are unfamiliar. If you use these terms, 
    define them immediately. Otherwise, they alienate new people. 
    <li>Don&#146;t turn to other passages unless necessary. When 
    turning to another passage, tell your audience how to find it and allow time 
    for them to find the passage before you read it. 
    <li>Stay grace-oriented. Non-Christians and new Christians usually view the Christian life
      without proper understanding of or emphasis on God's grace, so unless you emphasize this,
      they will usually hear you through a legalistic grid. When teaching biblical ethics,
      stress God&#146;s acceptance apart from our works, the Holy Spirit&#146;s role in
      sanctification and ministry, biblical ethical priorities (e.g., love over ritual; sexual
      purity over no cussing) and the fact that God&#146;s moral will is for our welfare and
      fulfillment. Having done this, be <i>strong</i> and <i>unashamed</i> in your ethical
      imperatives.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p><i>Use slang only if it is familiar and appropriate to your audience.</i> Otherwise it
    will reduce your credibility.</p>
    <i><p>Avoid verbal &quot;fat.&quot;</p>
    </i>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Avoid extraneous material and redundancy. 
    <li>Don't narrate what you went through as you prepared your teaching: &quot;So I wondered
      what this word was in the Greek&nbsp;.&nbsp;. .&quot; Tell your audience what you
      discovered, <i>not</i> 
    what you went through in the process. 
    <li>Don&#146;t say, &quot;An example/illustration of this
      is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&quot; Just give your example/illustration.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>If you blank out or goof up, go on to the next point. Resist the urge to go back over
    the part you messed up unless it is crucial to the teaching. You usually just make the
    mess worse.</p>

<p>After </b></font>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p><i>Stay alert during the questions and sharing.</i> Give appropriate responses to
    questions or added points. Be ready with additional questions to pose to the group if
    there are no questions or sharing.</p>
    <p><i>Look for individuals who want to talk further about the teaching.</i> This is
    spiritual opportunism. God often uses the teacher to powerfully affect people. Make
    yourself available to talk after the meeting, answer their questions, and advise
    additional steps.</p>
    <p><i>Have your teaching taped so you can listen to it afterwards.</i> &quot;If others
    have to listen to you, you should have to listen to yourself.&quot; This will often reveal
    things that you don&#146;t get from others&#146; feedback. Be careful about over-reacting
    to what you hear&#151;positively or negatively. You probably weren&#146;t as good or as
    bad as you think!</p>
    <p><i>Solicit feedback, especially from experienced teachers.</i> Ask them for both
    positive and critical observations. Model the ethic of receiving and giving
    feedback&#151;this is crucial for high quality teaching in your group.<dir>
      <dir>
        <p>Also, resist the &quot;seniority system&quot; tendency in home groups that has all the
        leaders taking turns regardless of gifting. Teaching is not a perk for years of service;
        it is a ministry for those who are gifted and want to teach. We need to have the most
        gifted teachers teaching! <b>(But hold out for character and personal ministry before
        including in personal rotation.).</b> Try new teachers out at retreats, cell groups,
        communion, etc.</p>
        <b><p>Explain &quot;Teaching Feedback&quot; form. When listening to other teachers, note
        positive (+) and negative (-) points as you hear them. Then arrange into proper category
        on the front.</p>
        <p>Explain &quot;<a href="tips.htm">Do&#146;s and Don&#146;ts</a>&quot; handout. Look this
        over. There is some overlap with tonight&#146;s material, but also some important
        additional points. You&#146;ll be reminded of some of these in the next three weeks!</p>

<p>3 Stages of Teacher Development: </font></b>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>STAGE #1: See &quot;<a href="firsttch.htm">Preparing Your First Few Teachings</a>&quot;
    for normal prep sequence for newer teachers. Rely primarily on tapes during this stage.</p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Some new teachers feel they must do &quot;their own material&quot; even when they
      aren&#146;t gifted or experienced enough to do this. The goal is not to be unique; it is
      to reach and instruct people! The burden is on you why you shouldn&#146;t use existing
      tapes by proven effective teachers. You &quot;make it your own&quot; by doing the
      research, getting the same burden and adding your own personal examples. Don't sacrifice
      the group on the altar of your creativity!</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>STAGE #2: Work up your own outline first, using the &quot;Homiletic Worksheet.&quot;
    Use the tape as a supplement &amp;/or stimulus.</p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>This is usually for teachers who demonstrate gifting in originality and have a fair
      amount of teaching experience. If you can get to this point, you have really accomplished
      something.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>STAGE #3: Create teachings regularly (not always) without relying on tapes. </p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Most people do not get to this stage. This takes a 
    high level of gifting, and the time needed for this kind of prep. 
    <li>Even highly gifted teachers tend to re-teach their material, adapting and improving it
      each time.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<font size="4"><b>

<p>Final Reminders </b></font>

<ul>
  <li>Remember where your group meets next week, and show 
  up on time! If you are first, come a little early to get your camera ready. 
  <li>Do your best as unto the Lord--and leave it at that.</li>
</ul>

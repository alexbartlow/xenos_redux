<h1>Authoritative Speaking</h1>

<p><font size="4"><b>Introduction to Class </b></font>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I am assuming you are familiar with hermeneutics, inductive study, etc. Therefore, we
    will spend both instructional weeks on homiletics.</p>
    <p>&quot;Homiletics&quot; means &quot;preaching&quot;--explaining and applying God's Word
    to our world. See Stott's 2 CLIFFS: Biblical passages were written to a specific setting
    which is separated from our world by an imposing chasm of language, culture, time, etc.
    Typically, the church has made one of two errors in this crucial task: <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Some tend to focus only on the task of understanding and explaining the biblical text.
        This is the typical error of theological conservatives, and it results in the sense that
        the Bible is irrelevant to our world (or trying to create a ghetto that mimics the
        biblical world).</p>
        <p>Others tend to focus on cultural relevance, but then reject or remake the biblical
        message to conform to contemporary perspectives. This is the typical error of theological
        liberalism, and it results in silencing the Bible's authority.</p>
        <p>God wants preachers--Christian communicators who are students of both worlds, who stand
        &quot;between two worlds&quot; and demonstrate that God's Word is intelligible, relevant,
        and impactful to our world (prophetic).</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Explain syllabus. <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>NOTE: Your teachings should attempt to squeeze a home group teaching into 10 minutes
        (just as home group teachings should not attempt to squeeze a Central Teaching into 30
        minutes). Use the tools and principles we give you to develop one main point from your
        passage.</p>
        <p>Get the overview out of the way AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Knock it out now so you can begin
        to think about your two passages.</p>
        <p>TONIGHT is all about how to create your teachings, so you can get started now. NEXT
        WEEK is about delivery, spiritual prep, and other related matters (I may defer your
        questions tonight).</p>
        <p>Cathy has tentative teaching schedules. Look it over at break and talk to her about
        date (not passage) changes.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>You&#146;re not here to impress me or anyone else. The goal is not to see how well you
    stack up to others (we have different levels of gifting and experience). The goal is to
    develop your teaching ability to serve God and others!! God is pleased if you do your
    best. This is a great opportunity to practice ministering under grace.</p>
    <p>Another great benefit of this class is learning the elements of a quality teaching
    makes you more effective in critiquing teachings. Use this class to help your fellow
    teachers, and to cultivate the ethic of teachers giving and receiving feedback.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p align="CENTER"><font size="4"><b><br>
Using the &quot;Homiletic Work Sheet&quot;</b></font></p>

<p>Notice the &quot;<a href="homwksht.htm">Homiletics Worksheet</a>&quot; at the back of
your class notes. You should also have four blank copies of this worksheet for working on
your own teachings.</p>

<p>This is a practical framework that supplies you with the important ingredients and
order for creating teachings. I don't always use it rigidly, but I have learned to think
this way and cover these bases when I prepare.</p>

<p>I'll explain how it works step by step, and then we'll look at a couple of sample
teachings.</p>

<p>The upper half is primarily analysis and interpretation that draws upon your inductive
study of the passage. The lower half is the actual homiletical outline.</p>

<p><font size="4"><b>STEP #1: &quot;Structural Context&quot; </b></font>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This refers to the strategic question in inductive study. This keeps the immediate and
    book context in mind to ensure proper interpretation. Once you see the strategic purposes
    of the author, it should be relatively easy to adapt those purposes to your audience with
    appropriate modification. <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>EXAMPLE: Colossians was written to address spiritual fervor that uncritically
        accepts pluralistic and syncretistic spirituality. This has an obvious parallel in our own
        culture today.</b></p>
        <p><b>You need this for your sake in preparation, not necessarily to give to your
        audience.</b></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><b><font size="4">STEP #2: &quot;Passage Outline&quot; </font></b>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This means a bare bones diagram of the thought development of the paragraph/passage. <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>Look especially for the main claim and how the other statements are related to it.
        (This is where the new inductive method is more helpful.)</b></p>
        <p><b>EXAMPLE: In Col. 2:9-15, 2:9,10a is the main claim. Paul then unpacks this claim
        that we have been made complete in Christ in three ways: we have been freed from demonic
        bondage (2:10b,15), we have been released from bondage to our sin-natures (2:11,12), and
        we have been released from the guilt of our sins (2:13,14).</b></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><b><font size="4">STEP #3: &quot;Theses-Antitheses&quot; </font></b>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This section is for summarizing the theological truths in the passage, and for
    identifying contemporary opposites to those truths. <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>You should have theses in the &quot;Theology&quot; section of the old inductive
        method, and in the &quot;Key theological concepts&quot; of the new method.</b> <blockquote>
          <p><b>In Col. 2:9-15, 2:10a is the main theological thesis, and the other statements serve
          to expound it.</b></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><b>You should have the antitheses in the &quot;Contemporary Application&quot; section
        of your inductive study. Here we are beginning to build the bridge between the biblical
        and contemporary worlds. Antitheses both help define the <i>meaning</i> of the thesis and
        reveal its <i>significance/relevance</i>.</b> <blockquote>
          <p><b>In Col. 2:9-15, contemporary antitheses include: Jesus is only one of many avatars
          (2:9), Christian salvation is only a rudimentary form of spirituality (2:10a), all spirits
          are essentially benevolent (2:10b,15), our main problem is psychological guilt (2:13,14),
          humans are essentially good and capable of self-reform (2:11,12).</b></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>From the theses discerned in the text, select those theses that best apply to the needs
    of your audience. <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>You do not have to deal with everything in your passage. Especially in a ten-minute
        teaching, you can only develop one or at most two theses. (Try to develop the main one.)</b></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Select those antitheses that are most relevant to your audience. For example, if your
    thesis is &quot;Salvation is by grace apart from works,&quot; your antithesis could be
    &quot;Salvation is by works apart from grace,&quot; or, &quot;Salvation is by grace plus
    works.&quot; The second antithesis would be likely to be held by our audience or by people
    they know, whereas the first is implausible for most people. <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>In Col.&nbsp;1:15-23, where the main claim is that Jesus is supreme over everything
        and everyone else in the universe (1:18b), an older antithesis would be &quot;Christ is
        only a good man or great teacher.&quot; A more relevant antithesis would be &quot;Christ
        is only one of many ways to God/salvation/spirituality.&quot;</b></p>
        <p><b>The &quot;Audience Analysis Worksheet&quot; helps you to focus in on your own
        audience.</b></p>
        <p><b>Check TV, BOOKS, MAGAZINES, MOVIES, MUSIC, INTERNET, DISCUSSIONS WITH
        NON-CHRISTIANS, etc. for suitable antitheses examples.</b></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><b><font size="4">STEP #4: Developing a Burden (not on the worksheet) </font></b>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Burden&quot; refers to your <i>attitude</i> toward the theses you are advancing.
    When you are personally convinced of the significance and practical importance of that
    truth for human life, you have a &quot;burden.&quot; When you are burdened, you are
    emotionally wrought up about this issue because you see how important it is. <i>This
    attitude is absolutely essential for effective biblical preaching.</i> <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>&quot;But if I say, 'I will not mention him or speak any more in his name,' his word
        is in my heart like a fire, a fire shut up in my bones. I am weary of holding it in;
        indeed, I cannot.&quot; (Jer. 20:9)</b></p>
        <p><b>STOTT: &quot;So possess the truth that it possesses you.&quot;</b></p>
        <p><b>A burdened preacher is like a charcoal briquette soaked with lighter fluid:
        &quot;Light a match and watch me burn!&quot;</b></p>

      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>NOTE: Good teachings have both &quot;heat&quot; and &quot;light.&quot;
    &quot;Heat&quot; comes from burden and application; &quot;light&quot; comes from solid
    study and knowing what your audience does and does not understand. &quot;Light&quot;
    without heat is boring; &quot;heat&quot; without light is manipulation/intimidation. Know
    your tendency and check each teaching for your weakness. (MORE NEXT WEEK ON DELIVERY)</b></p>
    <p>The burden for the teaching comes primarily from the &quot;thesis/antithesis&quot;
    section of the work sheet. The commonly or popularly expressed antitheses provide the
    &quot;fortresses&quot; in your audience's thinking that can be &quot;destroyed&quot; by
    the scriptural theses (see 2&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;10:4,5; 6:7). <i>This is why</i> t<i>eachings
    without antitheses are usually boring.</i> <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>J. W. Alexander: &quot;Preaching is argument made red-hot.&quot;</b></p>
        <p><b>PASTOR'S RESPONSE AT LEADERSHIP NETWORK RETREAT: &quot;I&#146;ve never heard of that
        before&#151;it changes everything.&quot;</b></p>
        <p><b>Especially in a relativistic culture, beware of getting backed away from this! Using
        antithesis in teachings also helps your people learn biblical discernment--a crucial
        aspect of the mind of Christ.</b></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>How to develop a &quot;burden&quot;: <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Prayerfully focus first on <i>your own life</i>: &quot;How has God changed my life
        through understanding and following this truth? When did I first learn this truth? How did
        I first apply it? How did my life suffer because I was ignorant of it? How have I
        re-learned and re-applied it since? What has happened when I have chosen to respond to
        this truth? What has happened when I have refused to follow it?&quot; Often, you will need
        to come under fresh conviction of the truth before you can become burdened to preach it. <blockquote>
          <p><b>&quot;Get <i>into</i> the Word, get <i>under</i> the Word&#151;then <i>go forth</i>
          with the Word!&quot;</b></p>
          <p><b>You may use some of this in your teaching&#151;but not necessarily.</b></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Next, prayerfully ask the same kinds of questions of <i>specific people likely</i> to
        be in your audience. Ask God for a vision of what could happen to them if they learn and
        follow this truth--and what will happen if they don&#146;t.</p>
        <p>Next, prayerfully think about how <i>people in our culture</i> have been damaged and
        deceived by the antitheses.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><b>STEP #5: &quot;Goal&quot; </b></font>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Your selection of theses and burden for those theses should yield a clear goal for your
    teaching. Unless you can state this goal in one or two concise phrases, you lack the
    clarity and focus needed for your teaching to be effective. If both Christians and
    non-Christians will be present, you should have a specific goal for each group. <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>Powerful teachings have one main theme! Don&#146;t try to include everything you
        know. The fact that you know much more about the passage than what you teach will give you
        intangible authority (&quot;ICE-BERG&quot; PRINCIPLE: 10% ABOVE THE SURFACE; 90% BELOW).
        Ruthlessly edit, leaving only what <i>illuminates</i> and <i>reinforces</i> your main
        theme. This is the difference between ONE SHARP, FINELY HONED ARROW and MANY BLUNT &amp;

<p><b><font size="4">STEP #6: &quot;Major Points&quot; &amp; &quot;Illustrations &amp;
Applications&quot;</font></b></p>

<p>This is where you should spend most of your time--reflecting, adjusting, etc. This is
also the creative part--there is no formula or recipe for creating your outline.</p>

<p>Arrange your material into a reasonable thought development in the <i>&quot;Major
Points&quot;</i> section. Often the theses or antitheses are the main points. At other
times, explanatory material may have to precede the statement of the theses or antitheses.
This section should supply as many of the following as needed (not necessarily in this
order): 

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>DECLARE THE THESIS: Strive for a concise, interesting statement that defines the
    thesis.</p>
    <p>JUSTIFY THE THESIS (if necessary) <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Sometimes, you need to clarify the thesis because it is unclear in the text. This is a
        practical way of staying under the authority of the Word. Otherwise, your audience will be
        resistant to further persuasion--or you are asking them to take your word for it. You can
        do this by:</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>

  <ul>
    <li>defining key words in the text <b>(<i>apekdusis</i> for &quot;disarming&quot; in
      Col.&nbsp;2:11--see its usage that way in 2:15)</b></li>
    <li>pointing out the context <b>(Col.&nbsp;1:15a &amp; 2:9 to show that
      &quot;first-born&quot; in 1:15b does not imply creaturehood)</b></li>
    <li>explaining relevant historical background <b>(circumcision's symbolic meaning in the Old
      Testament; &quot;certificate of debt&quot; in Col.&nbsp;2:14)</b></li>
    <li>alluding to other parallel passages <b>(Eph.&nbsp;6:12 to clarify identity of
      &quot;rulers and authorities&quot; in Col.&nbsp;2:15; Rom.&nbsp;6:5,6 to clarify
      connection to slavery to sin in Col.&nbsp;2:11,12)</b></li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Sometimes, you need to justify the thesis, not because it is unclear, but because it is
        <i>unpopular</i> in our culture <b>(e.g. hell, church discipline, sexual ethics,
        soteriological exclusivism).</b> The original author usually doesn&#146;t defend the
        thesis because his audience was already convinced of it, but you may need to &quot;back
        up&quot; and give an apologetical basis before you can go on in your teaching. Especially
        when non-Christians are present, effective persuasion cannot occur until you provide a
        reasonable defense. This also equips your Christian audience to do the same in their
        conversations with non-Christians.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>SUPPLY THE APPROPRIATE ANTITHESIS: Popularly expressed antitheses help to further
    define the thesis and bring out its significance to life (see above). They also often
    suggest certain obvious applications. <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>It is sometimes more effective to introduce the antithesis <i>before</i> contrasting
        it to the thesis.</b></p>
        <p><b>Sometimes the antithesis makes an effective introduction. In my teaching on
        Col.&nbsp;1:15-23, I began by asking which Jesus we should consult--quoting several
        different views of Jesus. This makes it relevant and raises tension, drawing people in.</b></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>ILLUSTRATE THE THESIS &amp; ANTITHESIS (if necessary): Most theses benefit from
    illustrations. Illustrations not only help explain spiritual truths, but also stimulate
    interest in and bring home the significance of the thesis. Be sure to recognize the
    limitations of the illustration. Consider these forms of illustration:</p>
  </blockquote>

  <ul>
    <li>Metaphors &amp; analogies <b>(Vine &amp; Branches; Running a race; Wedding ring &amp;
      marriage for circumcision/baptism)</b></li>
    <li>Historical stories <b>(D-Day and VE-Day to illustrate the 2 advents and the struggle
      between; EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION for Rom.&nbsp;6:6)</b></li>
    <li>Parables<b> (IRS agent; Niagara Falls tight-rope walker)</b></li>
    <li>Quotes/Interviews <b>(Sartre on the real reason for his atheism)</b></li>
    <li>Song lyrics <b>(&quot;Hello-Good-bye&quot; for relationship between medium &amp;
      message; &quot;Break in the Cup&quot; for horizontal love relationships; &quot;Language of
      the Heart&quot; for sexual immorality)</b> Either pass them out or read them carefully.</li>
    <li>Video clips <b>(&quot;The Mission&quot; or &quot;Scrooge&quot; for gratitude for
      forgiveness; &quot;Private Ryan&quot; for the motivating power of sacrifice;
      &quot;Contact&quot; for the role of faith; Joseph Campbell interview for Satan's lie in
      Gen. 3)</b></li>
    <li>Props <b>(Log in eye for Matt. 7; 2 pieces of paper glued together for sexual damage)</b></li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Keep a list of ideas on illustrations as you read, watch movies, listen to music, see
        examples in teachings, etc. </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>MAKE THE APPLICATION: This is the most important part of biblical preaching: to
    convince the audience of the need to <i>act</i> on the truth they&#146;ve just learned and
    been convinced of. What is your audience going to leave the room convinced of, motivated,
    and determined to <i>do</i>? <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>This should come from the &quot;GOAL&quot; section of your Homiletic Worksheet.</b></p>
        <p><b>See Jas. 1:22-25. Doing is a non-optional component of real learning.
        &quot;Explanation without application is a miscarriage of the truth.&quot;</b></p>
        <p>In many passages, the imperatives provide obvious lines of application that you need to
        flesh out <b>(&quot;set your mind on the things above&quot;)</b>. In passages without
        imperatives, you will need to supply them from other passages.</p>
        <p>Application should be clear and practical <b>(not humanly visible actions only--also
        attitudes and as a faith-response to God)</b>. You should find a way to communicate that
        you also need this application (and do not always follow it!).</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><b>STEP #7: Method(s) of Presentation (not in worksheet)</b></font></p>

<p>You will be thinking about this simultaneously while developing your main points and
illustrations/applications. Choose the method(s) of presentation best designed to persuade
your audience. More than one method is often appropriate in the same teaching. Possible
methods include: 

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>ARGUMENT: Anticipate and verbalize typical objections to your thesis, and then refute
    them. Paul uses this approach in Rom.&nbsp;1-11 and 2&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;10-13 (diatribe). <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>This should go on in almost every teaching. It is basic
        &quot;thesis-antithesis&quot; communication.</b></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>ADMONITION: Warn of the consequences of neglecting this truth. Many prophetic books
    (e.g., Amos) and portions of epistles (e.g., 1&nbsp;Thes. 4 and 1&nbsp;Cor. 6 on SEXUAL
    IMMORALITY; 1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;10 on syncretism; Heb.&nbsp;6,10,12 on apostasy) use this
    approach. <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>Sprinkle this in instead of using it for an entire teaching, and speak with
        humility/compassion--otherwise it comes off self-righteously.</b></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>INDIRECT CONVICTION: Arouse moral indignation in your audience, and then turn it on
    them (e.g., Nathan with David; <b>The callousness of the rich--<u>we</u> are the rich!</b>)
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>This is very effective, but difficult to do.</b></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>EXHORTATION/APPEAL: Appeal to God's love, concern for their well being, and the needs
    of others. This is the normal pattern for the &quot;exhortation&quot; sections of the New
    Testament epistles. <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>This is basically indicatives leading to imperatives--and should also be used a lot
        (e.g., FORGIVENESS). Often for conclusion.</b></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>VISION-CASTING: Paint a picture of what is possible if we respond to God in this area
    (e.g., John&nbsp;7:37,38). <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>Martin Luther King: &quot;I have a dream.&quot; </b></p>
        <p><b>Couple admonition with this as the &quot;replacement&quot; (e.g., Matt. 7's houses
        on sand/rock; Servant Team Retreat: Do you want to be Sardis or Caleb?) Otherwise
        admonition can come across legalistic. </b></p>
        <p><b>Make sure your vision is realistic and appropriately qualified or you lose
        credibility (MARRIAGE TALK: &quot;This marriage will not be perfect because in a fallen
        world there are no perfect relationships&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&quot;).</b></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>DILEMMA-RESOLUTION: Pose a problem (ethical, textual, etc.) and then resolve the
    problem in the main body of your teaching. <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>This works well for passages that contain problems (1 Cor. 11:5ff.; 14:34,35;
        1&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;2:11,12).</b></p>
        <p><b>You can also throw this in as one short part of a teaching.</b></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>QUESTIONS: Verbalize the important questions concerning this truth and make the answers
    to these questions the main points of your teaching. <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>John 3 &#150; &quot;Who needs the new birth?&quot; &quot;What is the new
        birth?&quot; &quot;How do you get the new birth?&quot; &quot;&quot;Why do people reject
        the new birth?&quot;</b></p>
        <p><b>Lk.&nbsp;9:18-26 - &quot;Who is Jesus?&quot; &quot;What does Jesus' messianic
        mission require?&quot; What is the cost of following Jesus?&quot; &quot;What is the reward
        of following Jesus?&quot;</b></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><b><font size="4">STEP #8: &quot;Introduction&quot; </font></b>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>After you have constructed the main outline, you should be able to create an effective
    introduction without too much difficulty. Effective introductions point to the direction
    of the teaching, and provide a mandate for listening to the main points. Avoid long
    introductions--get into your text as quickly as possible. <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>If you turn to the passage and then do a long introduction, they will start reading
        ahead without you. If you must have a longer introduction, don't tell people what text
        you're in until the end of it.</b></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><b><font size="4">STEP #9: &quot;Conclusion&quot; </font></b>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The conclusion will often call for a response from your audience. It may also summarize
    the content of the outline. <b>Home group teachers should be ready with related questions
    to redirect the group into discussion.</b> Avoid trailing off without a definite end.</p>
  </blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><b>Examples of Completed <a href="rom12wk.htm">Homiletical Worksheets</a></b></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Tips on Teaching Narrative (if time) </b></font>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>You may need to supply more historical background to make it come alive.</p>
    <p>Avoid &quot;moralizing&quot; the text--stopping constantly to make little application
    points. This &quot;string of pearls&quot; teaching style obscures the main point(s) of the
    narrative. Instead, determine the main point(s) of the narrative section and build your
    outline around it/them.</p>
    <p>Identify the &quot;tension&quot; in the narrative--the conflict between two parties,
    the discrepancy between promise and fulfillment, etc. Tell the story in a way that
    highlights this &quot;tension.&quot; This unleashes the inherent power of narrative and
    will draw people in. <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>Abraham &amp; God; Jacob &amp; Esau; Joseph &amp; brothers</b></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In long narrative sections (e.g., Joseph), condense the story and tell it in an
    interesting way without reading most of the text. Read only key portions of the text. Then
    distill your theology and/or application afterwards.</p>

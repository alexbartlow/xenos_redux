<p>Why study the Bible? The Word is power: 

<ul>
  </b>
  <li>Creation occurred by God's word &quot;by the word of God the heavens existed long ago,
    &quot; (2 Pet 3:5) &quot;Let there be light&quot;, &quot;Let there be an
    expanse&#133;&quot;, This is also why the Word of God is referred to as a sword in
    Ephesians (6:17) and in Hebrews (4:12). </li>
  <li>Changes thinking: John 8:31-32, &quot;If you abide in my word, you are truly disciples
    of mine and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.&quot; It does this
    because the Word shows us the mind of Christ. </li>
  <li>Changes lives: That&#146;s why Paul tells us God&#146;s word is &quot;profitable for
    teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of
    God may be adequate, equipped for every good work,&quot; (2 Tim. 3:16).</li>
</ul>

<p>Intro to Inductive Method: </p>
<i>

<p></b>Art vs. Science</i> 

<dir>
  <p>People want a cut and dry method to extract meaning from God&#146;s word as though they
  were following a manual for building a deck. The problem is God&#146;s word is not
  designed this way. There is no manual; there are only guidelines. This is because
  interpretation is not a science. There are methods we can follow to help us come to right
  conclusions but methods will only get us part of the way there. </p>
  <p>There is an art to interpreting the Bible. It requires skill, finesse, insight, and the
  power of the Holy Spirit. </p>
  <p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(2 Peter 1:20,21) But know this first of
  all, that no prophecy of Scripture is <i>a matter</i> of one's own interpretation, for no
  prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke
  from God.</font><font FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2"></p>

<p>Approaching a book for study</p>
</b><i>

<p>Preliminary assessment:</i> What kind of book is this? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Biblical interpretation really begins with a thorough understanding of the Bible as a
  whole. But we gain that understanding bit by bit. No one starts out interpreting the Bible
  with a full-blown knowledge of all its parts. While it is true that the Bible builds upon
  itself and that later revelation often refers to what was written earlier, much of the New
  Testament was written to those who were not entirely biblically literate. Much of the NT
  is simplified and explained for us because it is largely written with a Gentile audience
  in mind. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have already answered a few questions as you begin to use this worksheet. You have
  decided that this book is a letter or an epistle. What&#146;s the difference? An epistle
  is a type of letter, but whereas a letter is usually written to a specific individual,
  such as Timothy, an epistle is written to a wider audience, such as the church in Galatia.
  But the most important thing to understand is that this kind of writing is occasional;
  there were specific circumstances which brought about its writing. An epistle is written
  by an individual at a certain time and place, usually in response to some event, question,
  or occasion that has presented itself. For instance, the epistle to the Galatians is
  written in response to pressing concerns about harmful influences in the church. If we
  discern what situation occasioned the writing of the epistle we are studying, we have gone
  a long way toward understanding the meaning of the book we&#146;re studying. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<dir>
  <font FACE="Arial"><p>Because this book is an epistle you have answered another question
  as to where it is situated within God&#146;s redemptive plan. It is clearly after the
  crucifixion and resurrection of Christ and is written to help us understand more fully the
  meaning of those events and apply them to daily life. </p>

<p></i><strong>General Overview.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Read through the book completely. (read in class; divide into paragraphs)</p>
</blockquote>
<i>

<p>Logic of beginning with overview:</i></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The purpose of beginning by reading the entire book is that it gives you an
  understanding of where the author is heading. Once you know where the author is going, you
  will have a better understanding of how he builds his argument. Without getting a sense of
  the whole, we tend to misuse the parts. We cannot really understand the parts of a text in
  isolation from each other. This is the error of proof-texting or wrenching a passage out
  of its context and applying it to a situation. (Example: James 2:14,24 &quot;What use is
  it, my brethren, if a man says he has faith, but he has not works? Can that faith save
  him? &#133;You see that a man is justified by works, and not by faith alone.&quot;
  Luther's response. Passage hinges on &quot;justification.&quot;) If we have not taken the
  time to understand the context, we will be guilty of this error by default. However, if we
  have taken the time to attempt to understand the whole, our ability to understand the
  parts will be greatly enhanced. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to understand a specific passage of scripture we need to see the broader
  context. We call this the <em>inductive-deductive</em> approach to understand scripture.
  It is really just a reflection of how understanding occurs in general, that is, we tend to
  see the parts in terms of the whole. And we understand the whole as made up of various
  parts. When we approach the biblical interpretation in this way it allows us to have a
  system of checks and balances. The way this works is that we read a passage, say 1 John
  3:6. &quot;No one who abides in Him sins; no one who sins has seen Him or knows Him.&quot;
  This passage has been used by those who want to prove that Christians no longer sin. When
  we read this passage we may immediately question our salvation in Christ because our
  experience does not conform to this passage. We may waste a lot of time attempting to
  interpret this passage out of its context. It is only when we are able to see the entire
  scope of John's epistle and attempt to harmonize this passage with the rest of his letter
  that we gain any clarity on what he is saying. So what has happened is that we have
  reasoned from the bottom up (what does this passage say) and from the top down (what does
  the rest of the book say). We put together the whole in terms of the parts and the parts
  in terms of the whole. </p>
</blockquote>
<i>

<p>Historical context: Author, audience, and third party.</i> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Read the book, noting every time the author is mentioned, every time the audience or
  readers are mentioned, and every time anyone else is mentioned&#151;we call them the third
  party. This third party is not who the letter is directed towards but they often figure
  prominently in why the letter was written. We identify parties in the letter in order to
  understand what historical circumstances motivated the author&#146;s communication. Behind
  this method is an assumption about the nature of epistles which we have already mentioned,
  that is that epistles are occasional documents, they were written to address a specific
  situation on a specific occasion. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Who is the third party in Galatians?</p>
</blockquote>

<dir>
  <i><p>Hint: </i></p>
</dir>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ask questions of the epistle as you read. The secret of good interpretation comes by
  asking questions of the text, such as: What concerned the author as he wrote? What sorts
  of error had the readers fallen into? Are there any other groups or people being mentioned
  by the author to whom the letter is not specifically addressed? Why does the author take
  the tone or approach that he does? What is motivating the author and what does he want to
  see changed in his audience? </p>

<i><b>

<p>Structure</b>: Skeleton. </i>

<ol>
  <p>The goal here is to clarify the development of the author's thoughts or argument. The
  structure of an author&#146;s writing functions like a body&#146;s skeleton. It is unseen
  when you look at the surface. And yet, it provides the framework that in large part
  determines the shape and size of the body. Of course, it&#146;s not the only determining
  factor in the way a person looks. Attached to the skeleton is muscle
  tissue&#151;content&#151;that drives the movement of the structure. Covering both the
  skeleton and muscular tissue is the skin&#151;application&#151;that gives final shape to
  the body. The skin is what gives final form to the biblical structure and content and it
  is what we see of a person day-to-day and yet it is only a reflection of the underlying
  content/musculature and skeletal structure. </p>
  </font><i><p></i><font FACE="Arial">The structure of a book or a paragraph is generally
  unseen by the reader until he or she begins to look carefully at what is being said. The
  importance in this is that once you begin to recognize the structure, you will better
  understand how things fit together. How does the author organize what he wants to
  communicate? The way he organizes his statements will emphasize certain points while
  subordinating others. This is important for us because we want to emphasize what the
  writer emphasizes. This usually becomes clear as we see how an author </font><font face="Arial" size="3">puts together his thoughts. <br>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>A. </i><b>Context:</b><i> literary &amp; theological</i>
  </font></p>
  <p><font FACE="Arial">What are the ideas or themes communicated before and after your
  paragraph? From where is the author coming and to where is he going? How does this passage
  fit into the broader context and argument of the book you are studying? </p>
  <p>Where is the author going with the point that is being made in the passage you are
  studying? Is there a break in thought between what occurred previously and what occurs
  afterward? If so, why? Becoming a good interpreter means being able to see the flow or
  logic of the text. To use the analogy of the structure of a passage as a skeletal
  framework, this means being able to see how the bones connect within your passage and
  which bones they connect to before and after your passage. </p>
  <i><p>B. </i><b>Main Point:</b><i> What is the central claim of this passage?</i> </p>
  <p>In order to understand a paragraph we need to know what is the central idea or theme of
  the paragraph. What does the author want his readers to understand or to do? Write out the
  central claim in your own words. Is there one verse that most succinctly states the main
  point? We determine this by considering the following clues the author uses to make his
  point clear.</p>
  <p>Read 1:6-10</p>
  <b><p>Hints<i>:</p>
  </b><p>Identify Conclusions: </i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Conclusions are generally <i>indicated by words like: </i>thus, therefore, so, so that,
    hence, then, consequently. &quot;Therefore&quot; or &quot;for this reason&quot; often
    indicates the author&#146;s main point. Circle these kinds of words which indicate that
    the author is drawing a conclusion. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <i><p>Identify Imperatives</i>: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>An imperative is a command. Often, <b>but not always</b>, in the epistles the main
    point of a passage is found in the imperative statements. The author is instructing his
    readers to do a certain activity or to think in a specific way. What is the author telling
    his audience to do? </p>
  </blockquote>
  <i><p>Identify a controlling idea:</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Sometimes a passage doesn&#146;t include an imperative or doesn&#146;t have a
    conclusion indicator. Ask yourself what is the controlling idea of the passage. What
    universal truth or overarching idea accounts for all of the elements of the passage? </p>
  </blockquote>
  <i><p>Identify independent clauses:</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Generally speaking the main point will be contained in the part of the sentence which
    can stand on its own. It may not be a full sentence as it is written but it could be. A
    dependent clause is one that cannot stand alone as a sentence. It is by definition a
    modifying statement put there to give support or give clarification to the main clause. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(Review the sentences in 1:6-10 to identify dependent versus independent clauses.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Before continuing, you will want to write down the thesis statement of the passage
    (identify a verse). It may also be helpful to underline this in your Bible for future
    reference. Before continuing you should summarize the main point in your own words.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <i><p>C. </i><b>Supporting points.</b><i> How is the main point supported?</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In other words, why is the claim true and why should the readers do what the author
    says?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>You&#146;ve already discerned what the main point of the passage is, now you want to
    identify how the author backs up that point. What theological basis or principles are
    given by the author to support his claim? Or what illustrations does he use to support his
    point? In this section we are mostly asking questions about why. Why does he want them to
    do what he tells them to do? Why do they need to understand this information? Why is it
    important to their Christian lives? </p>
  </blockquote>
  <b><p>List out the supporting points.</p>
  <p>Hints:</p>
  </b><i><p>Identify indicatives</i>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Indicatives are statements that claim to be true. They are often the basis for an
    imperative. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <i><p>Identify connective words:</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Connective words link a supporting idea to a main idea. They tell us the reason behind
    the central claim of a passage. Connective words are words such as: because, for, since,
    as, for this purpose, so that, in order that(1Pet4:6). Indicate indicatives in your text
    by placing a box around these kinds of words and underlining the statement they are linked
    to. These connective words connect to one of two kinds of statements: indicative
    statements or result clauses. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <i><p>Identify result statements:</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>These statements indicate the kind of results the author wants to see or wants to warn
    us about. It is not necessarily an indicative but it is the outcome sought or hoped for.
    In Galatians 3:24, Paul concludes a section on the purpose of the law with,
    &quot;Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ. . .&quot; He finishes
    this statement with the result that the Law is intended to bring about, namely, &quot;so
    that we may be justified by faith.&quot; Again, in Galatians 5:16-24 Paul tells his
    audience to &quot;walk by the Spirit,&quot; which is his main point. He backs up his claim
    by showing his readers the results of walking in the spirit as well as showing them the
    antithesis, which is walking according to the flesh. The desired outcome, or its
    antithesis, helps answer the question of why we should do what the author is telling us. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <i><p>Identify Illustrations/Examples:</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Sometimes the author gives an illustration or example to support his main point. Paul
    does this in Galatians by using Abraham as an example of the principle that righteousness
    is by faith. In 3:6 he tells the Galatians, &quot;Even so Abraham believed God, and it was
    reckoned to him as righteousness.&quot; Paul uses Abraham as an example of the principle
    he&#146;s trying tocommunicate. Whenever the author quotes Scriptures, he is citing an
    illustration or example. (Rhetorical questions.) </p>
  </blockquote>
  <i>
</ol>
<b>

<p></i>Content/ Theology:</b><i> Muscle 

<ol>
  <p></i>In this section we are not as concerned with how something is said as we are with <b>what
  is said</b>. This is what we normally think of as interpretation. Think again of the
  passage as a body. The structure or the way the body is put together is the skeletal
  framework. The muscle that hangs on the skeleton is its content. As we&#146;ve gone
  through identifying the structure of the passage, we have also done some of the work in
  examining the content. In identifying connective words and supporting ideas, we are
  examining the structure. When we ask what or to whom those ideas or words refer and what
  they mean we are examining the content. </p>
  <b><p>Hints</b>:<i></p>
  <p>Identify important words and phrases.</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In this part of our study, we will want to gain clarity on exactly what is being said
    and what it means. One way that we do this is by clarifying important or unfamiliar words.
    It is easy to get bogged down in word studies because nearly every word seems interesting.
    Be selective in the words you choose to study, usually one to three words in any passage
    is sufficient. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <i><p>Unfamiliar words:</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If you&#146;re unfamiliar with a word, maybe you have never seen the word before or
    maybe you&#146;ve just never heard a good definition for it, take the time to look it up
    in a good Bible dictionary. You may be surprised at the rewards you reap by clarifying
    unfamiliar words. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <i><p></i>Example: If you're studying Galatians chapter three you may wonder what exactly
    Paul means by the word &quot;blessed.&quot; This is a word that Paul draws from the Old
    Testament text but it is also a word that Jesus uses. With a relatively small amount of
    work you can discover that when Paul says &quot;So then those who are of faith are blessed
    with Abraham, the believer&quot; he is referring to much more than an emotional state. The
    word is used of the gift that would come to the Gentiles through Abraham's willingness to
    be used by God. It is a theologically loaded term that finds its fulfillment in Jesus
    Christ. Paul is saying that faith produces the righteousness of Abraham.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <i><p>Strategically important words: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p></i>One way to determine if a word is important is if it&#146;s emphasized or repeated
    by the author. In studying the book of Romans the word justification appears numerous
    times and in many different forms. If we are to understand the meaning of the book of
    Romans, justification would be an important concept to understand. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Another way that we decide the importance of a word is based on the role it plays in
    the author&#146;s thought. Does the paragraph or sentence we&#146;re studying somehow
    hinge on an understanding of this word? </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>After you&#146;ve studied the important or unfamiliar words, how does your new-found
    appreciation for this word contribute to your understanding of the passage. Eventually we
    will also want to ask how it affects our understanding of the book?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Example: &quot;Deserting&quot; in 1:6 is a word that means to transfer allegiance from
    one party to another, or literally to change teachers or to desert your fellow soldiers
    (metatithami). </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><i>Identify theological/historical contexts </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p></i>As you think about theological or historical contexts, think about the big picture.
    What other passages talk about these issues? What other passages might be relevant to the
    passage you're studying? Do other scriptures speak to the same issues to which your
    passage speaks? </p>
    <p>Does the author quote from Scripture or refer to an historical event? If so, for what
    purpose does he use the quote? It is important to always look up the passage being quoted
    in its original context.<i></p>
  </blockquote>
  </i><blockquote>
    <p><i><img SRC="image4.gif" WIDTH="566" HEIGHT="514"> <br>
    <br>
    </i>This is the place to clarify or research historical or geographic references that are
    unfamiliar to you. A good Bible dictionary is helpful in this regard and will often
    provide insights into the text that you would otherwise miss. </p>
    <p>Why does the author say what he does? If the author gives an imperative without
    providing a theological reason, it is important to ask what is the theological or cultural
    basis for the command. We have looked at <b>how</b> he says it and <b>what</b> he says but
    it also important to ask why he says it. The &quot;<b>why</b>&quot; is often rooted in the
    nature of God. </p>

  <p>How is the argument of the passage intended to affect the original audience in terms of
  actions, attitudes and convictions? </i></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Let's recall the main point of the passage. If there is an imperative in the passage,
    what is the author calling on his audience to do? The desired effects may be spelled out
    plainly by the author but it is important to pause and ask how the application relates to
    the historical situation of the audience. If the author is telling them to do something is
    it because they weren't doing it at the time? How would their circumstances relate to what
    they were or were not doing? </font></p>

<dir>
  <font FACE="Arial"><i><p>What similarities exist between the original audience and myself
  or my audience?</p>
  </i><blockquote>
    <p>Before we can move to asking how this passage applies to myself or my audience we need
    to examine the similarities between our situation and that of the original audience. (The
    analogy of skin is appropriate here because as circumstances and cultures change the
    application of a biblical principle, it will take on different manifestations. However,
    what does not change is the underlying structure of the author's argument--skeleton--and
    theological content--musculature. In fact, this underlying framework will determine the
    shape that our application takes in a given context. To carry this analogy further, what
    we want to avoid is introducing a layer of fat that distorts the theological shape and
    results in a culturally misappropriate application.) </p>

  <i><p>Is the passage directly applicable to my audience because we are in the same</i> <i>situation
  as the original audience or is it only applicable in principle?</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The reason we ask this question is because epistles are occasional documents, the
    writers are in the process of applying truths to specific life circumstances. Because our
    circumstances may differ from the original audience&#146;s, we cannot necessarily make a
    one-to-one correlation. Epistles can be considered &quot;case studies&quot; which apply
    biblical principles to specific situations (Ericson, LMS, p 250) in as much as our current
    situation mirrors that of the original audience, we can apply the passage directly. But
    when our circumstances differ significantly, we often need to work from the principle
    being given in order to apply it to our situation. </p>

  <i><p>Ephesians 5:18: Drunk with wine or the headcovering example</p>
  </i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Why is it that most women do not wear headcoverings in the church today even though
    Paul explicitly commands it? The reason has to do with cultural relevance. Paul was giving
    a practical expression of a spiritual truth, namely that we should&#151;in this case women
    should&#151;respect authority. The principle of authority (1 Cor. 11:3) is tied to a
    spiritual truth but the way that this respect is shown is in keeping with the cultural
    norms. In 1 Cor.11:5,14 Paul is telling the church specifically not to go against cultural
    norms in expressing this principle of submission to authority. However, outward expression
    of this principle in dress or manner is no longer relevant today because it is not
    something our culture practices and yet the biblical principle remains true and should
    find expression in the attitudes and interactions between a husband and a wife.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>What is Paul&#146;s attitude toward those who add anything to the gospel? Should we
    treat distorters (Catholics?) in the way Paul is referring to them here? Paul is not
    addressing them directly. Persuade first. We need to recognize that those who preach false
    gospels are opposing Christ. Judaizers were well informed; Paul had run into them before.
    They were operating from corrupt motives. </font></p>

  </i><blockquote>
    <p>Recall what the main point of the passage is. It is important to apply what the text
    meant to apply, often this is found in an imperative statement. To what life issues does
    the passage speak ? Think of specific situations in which this passage or its principle
    would apply in your life and be as specific as possible. We often limit our thinking to
    theological truths contained in the passage and then fail to apply the obvious imperatives
    contained in God&#146;s word.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Those who dare to oppose the gospel are opposing Christ! You cannot change the gospel
    or preach contrary to the gospel without preaching against Christ. What the false teachers
    in Galatia were doing was adding to Christ&#146;s work. Paul is irate because this takes
    away from Christ&#146;s finished work and consequently it takes away from God&#146;s
    glory.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isn&#146;t this the way it always is? The greatest threat to the gospel comes not from
    those who are on the outside, but those on the inside. Historically, those within the
    church have caused the greatest damage to the church. The way to serve God is to preach
    the gospel and be faithful to the gospel.</p>

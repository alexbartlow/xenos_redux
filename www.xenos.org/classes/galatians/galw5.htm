<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Freedom provides opportunity for sin. But we&#146;ve seen
  that sin is ultimately destructive. Why would anyone choose it? If you really are sincere
  at fulfilling the law, then love each other. When a lawyer asked Jesus what was the
  greatest commandment he replied &quot;Love the Lord your God&#133;the second is like it,
  You shall love your neighbor as yourself,&quot; (Mt. 22:39). </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">It is the golden rule, &quot;Therefore, however you want
  people to treat you, so treat them, for this is the Law and the Prophets,&quot; (Mt.
  7:12). God's law is geared toward serving. </font></p>

  <p><em><font face="Arial" size="3">What is freedom about in the Christian life?</font></em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When we think of freedom we think of casting off morals,
  parental controls, governmental oppression. (Braveheart) In the biblical model, freedom is
  not about throwing off all restraints. It is all about being released from a slavery to
  sin and death, brought about by the law, <b>in order that</b> we might be released into
  God's custody. Here is the whole argument of the book thus far: we have been held in
  bondage, held under the custody of a cruel taskmaster that would eventually beat us to
  death, and now we have been liberated, we've been redeemed from the slave market and
  purchased as a son. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">What does it mean to act like an heir? Well, it means to
  serve in the family of God, to serve in God's kingdom. You may say, I want to be free not
  to serve. I want to be free to do my own thing. But there is no freedom there. That is
  simply slavery to death masking as freedom. There are only two options: we serve the
  flesh, which is death through biting and devouring, or we serve God which results in
  life--and it ends up fulfilling the Law, though indirectly. (Read Stott p. 143 as
  antithesis. We become sanctified not by attempting to keep the law through the Spirit but
  by attempting to love through the Spirit.) </font></p>

<i>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Meaning</i>:</font> 

<dir>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Paul takes the idea of our freedom in Christ one step
  further than he has done to this point in the book. Not only are we freed from the demands
  of the Law but we are also freed from the tyranny of sin in our flesh. Because we have
  crucified our flesh in Christ, which took place in Christ's crucifixion or when we
  accepted Christ, we are no longer controlled by our fleshly impulses. Paul&#146;s command
  to walk by the Spirit is only possible because our flesh no longer reigns supreme. Paul
  commands his audience to live by the Spirit. He supports this imperative by an
  illustration of the detrimental effects of the flesh in contrast to the life giving
  effects of the Spirit. He ends this section with the essential indicative truth that
  enables the Galatians to live by the Spirit, that is, because they are no longer enslaved
  to their flesh.</font></p>

  snap at your children? Do you fight with your spouse? Do you stay up late so that you get
  some alone time on the internet when your wife or roommates aren&#146;t watching? Are you
  contented in life? Is your life characterized by thankfulness before God for what He has

  the flesh. The flesh is what we have through our natural birth. The Spirit is what we have
  through our spiritual rebirth. This reminds me of George Kastanza on Seinfeld. George is

<dir>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Paul begins this section with general instruction to live
  and walk by the Spirit. Living by the Spirit probably refers to the manner in which we
  were brought into the kingdom of God. The Galatians began their Christian experience by
  the Spirit (3:3). We live spiritually only because the Spirit of God is within us. Paul is
  taking as fact that all Christians live by the Spirit; there is no other way we can live.
  If this then is how we are regenerated, then let&#146;s continue our spiritual lives in
  the manner in which we began them, by depending on the Spirit of God. </font></p>
</dir>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Verse 25 also functions to bring together the various
  thoughts that follow. He then goes on to provide examples of what this kind of lifestyle
  looks like through a series of brief imperatives. Each of these instructions falls under
  the umbrella of living by the Spirit. This section is really an expansion of the previous
  section that details more carefully what walking by the Spirit looks like. </font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Walk by the Spirit. If you're walking by God's spirit,
  these are some of the things you will be doing: practicing humility, seeking to restore
  fallen brothers and sisters, coming alongside other Christians in support as the Spirit
  comes alongside to support us; sharing with those who teach and train you; practicing
  endurance in the Christian life; and serving other Christians around you. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I think Paul is telling them, that they are not practicing
  these things. The Galatians have been biting and devouring one another, they have been
  boastful and envious, they have been gloating over their brothers and sisters who have
  fallen into sin. And what has been the result--corruption. The smell of death has
  characterized this young church. Why, because they have been following the Spirit? No,
  because they have been trying to live out the law and the law is of the flesh. They smell
  like death because they have been living in death. They have been living in the flesh. If
  you want to give off the aroma of Christ to those around you, there is only one way-- to
  walk by the Spirit. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There is great application here also for the person who
  feels futile. They have been serving God. They have been serving the brothers and sisters
  around them but don't feel like they have gone anywhere. People don't seem to recognize
  all of the work I'm doing. God does not seem to acknowledge it. I seem to be going
  nowhere. We are tempted to be critical of others who are progressing who are being
  recognized. Maybe you envy those around you who have been given greater responsibilities. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Paul cautions us: God is not mocked. He sees and He
  rewards. You will sow what you reap. If you are faithful to walk according to the Spirit,
  if you are faithful in serving, you will change. You will manifest the fruits of the
  spirit eventually. I think there is a lesson there about God's faithfulness.</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">This kind of life entails a certain amount of action. There
  is certainly room for being led by the Spirit in the passive sense (v 18). But Paul's
  command is for us to be active in following the Spirit, &quot;walk by the Spirit.&quot;
  Seek out the things of the Spirit. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">If we are to walk according to the line the Holy Spirit
  lays down for us, we must actively seek out God's way. Paul doesn't really tell us how but
  I think it would be appropriate to turn to some other passages to flesh this out. Rom.
  8:5-6 tells us to set our minds on the things of the Spirit. Col. 3:1-2 tells us that
  since we have been raised with Christ we should continue to seek the things above, to set
  our minds on Christ. We do this by meditating on Christ. We do this by making it a
  practice to pray at all times in the Spirit, to have a prayerful approach to God as we go
  about our day. We walk in the Spirit by immersing our minds and our thought life in the
  Word of God. We do this above all by seeking to serve those around us, by &quot;doing good
  to all men.&quot; </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Do you want to walk according to the Spirit? Look for
  opportunities to serve. The Spirit of God wants to love and serve those around us. He
  wants to use us as a tool of God's love in the world. How else will God reconcile the
  world to himself, how else will He show the world His character if not through the loving
  example of His people. </font></p>

  indeed.&quot; Our natural tendency is to corrupt what is internal and spiritual by turning
  it into something that is external and quantifiable. God complains against the Israelites,
  &quot;this people draw near with their mouth and honor me with their lips, while their
  hearts are far from me,&quot; (Is. 29:13). </font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We cannot conclude that the outward forms are without
  purpose, but they are certainly not the essence. Let's apply this to something like the
  Servant Team. There is value in being part of a group of Christians committed to serving,
  but if we conclude that this is the heart of the matter--that once you are a part of this
  external group you can stop serving--you've missed the point. The outward form is far less
  important than the inward conviction. I would rather have someone in my home group who is
  a leader in their actions than a leader whose heart isn't in it. </font></p>

  It is to be declared innocent or righteous. It is to be imparted the standing of
  Christ&#146;s perfect life; to obtain the standards of God or to live up to God&#146;s
  character. We have been acquitted by God but more than that, we have been given
  righteousness or the standard of the perfection of Christ&#146;s life. (This is why the

  Martin Luther was sitting in some German monastery doing an inductive study on Galatians
  when he realized the folly of Roman Catholicism! Catholicism had added good works to the
  message of grace and removed justification by faith alone from the gospel. Imagine the
  result if the Gospel had not prevailed in Galatia and in Jerusalem. The church would be
  re-enslaved to the Law. We would deny Christ's finished work by adding our works</b>.</font></p>

  am able to contribute nothing. (It would be like adding to infinity. Christ supplies
  infinity and I come along with 17 good works. You can't add to what is already infinite or
  what is already perfect.)</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our actions need to be in line with the truth of the

  has a radically equalizing effect on Christians. We are all on the same level in

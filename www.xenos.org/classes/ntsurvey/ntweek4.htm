<p><em>Paul and the spread of Christianity to the Gentiles</em></p>
</b><i>

<p>Conditions in the Roman world</p>
</i>

<blockquote>
  <b><p></b>1. Commerce: roads, language, safety.</p>
  <p>2. Citizenship: freedom to travel and be protected by Roman law.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

  the Jews.</p>
</blockquote>
<i>

<p>Paul's conversion and commission (9:1-31): Door to the Gentiles opened</p>

<blockquote>
  </i><p>1. Paul&#146;s commission (9:15) </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Paul was ideally suited to be God's man to the Gentiles. He was a Roman citizen. He was
    bicultural. He was a zealous Jew. The narrative of Acts changes dramatically with the
    conversion of Paul: Now the focus is on Paul and the mission to the Gentiles.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>2. Peter's ministry to the Gentiles (9:32-10:18)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Just as Peter had begun the public ministry of the church to the Jews, he also made an
    important bridge to the gentiles (9:32-10:18). See especially the vision of the table
    (10:9ff).</p>
    <i>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Paul's first missionary journey (13:1-15:35)</p>
</i>

<blockquote>
  <p>1. Sent out by the church at Antioch (13:1-3).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>2. Cyprus (13:4-12)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This seemed to be a natural place, because it was Barnabus' home. Historical reference
    to Sergius Paulus is important, because we know that he was there for less than 2 years.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>3. Asia Minor (13:13-14:28)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <b><p></b>Strategy:</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>a. Urban centers.<b> </b>The cities were less tied to their traditional religious forms
    than those in the countryside. City life also lent itself better for the propagation of
    the gospel. They are centers of commerce, etc. Also, Paul could work at tentmaking in the
    cities, which he did from time to time.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<b>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p></b>b. Synagogues. His costume was to go directly to the synagogue, because he was
    qualified to teach. Also, it is the Jews that possessed the revelation from God that shows
    Jesus to be the messiah. Paul would stay at the synagogue as long as he was welcome.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>c. Paul's central message (13:16-42)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>d. &quot;God fearers&quot; (13:43). Paul was typically expelled from the synagogue
    after a few weeks. But, he was well received by the gentiles who attended the Jewish
    services. These were people who were impressed with the Jewish religion, but were
    unwilling to undergo circumcision and observe the ritual laws of Judaism. Paul taught that
    one does not have to first become a Jew to be a Christian. For the God fearers, this was a
    truly liberating message. Yet, among the Jews, Paul formed many enemies.<b></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
</b><i>

<p>Establishing the church </p>

<blockquote>
  <p></i>Paul would stay in a city usually for a short period of time, especially on the
  first journey. He would appoint elders from among the new believers to be responsible for
  reading and teaching from the scripture, and leading the new community.</p>
  <p>Paul and Barnibus returned to Antioch by retracing their steps. They devoted their
  attention to grounding the believers in truth, rather than high profile evangelistic
  ministry.<i></p>
  </i>
</blockquote>
<i>

<p>Jerusalem council (15:1-35)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p></i>News of Paul's success among the Gentiles brought a new dimension into the church.
  These people who have not been the people of God, and whose religious and cultural forms
  were pagan were now being incorporated into the body of Christ. But this immediately
  raised issues that were threatening to divide the church.<i></p>
  </i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <b><p></b>1. Question: What is the relationship of Christianity to Mosaic Law?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>a. Position of the Judaizers (15:1,5).<b> </b>Judaizers are those who taught that
    gentiles must first become Jews before they can be saved. That is, the Christian community
    would be completely Jewish. The Gentiles would needed to undergo circumcision, observe the
    Mosaic Law, etc. In essence, a gentile must reject his cultural as well as religious
    background. Clearly this raised theological problems (df: salvation) and well as practical
    ones.</p>
    <p>b. Testimony of Peter (15:7-12). Peter's testimony would carry a unique authority in
    the minds of the church leaders, given his stature in the founding of the church.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <b><p></b>2. Findings summarized by James(15:13-29)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The statement on the Law is as important as anything, showing as it does that James was
    in agreement with Paul that the Law could not be lived up to anyway (cf Mt. 7:1). Given
    the central importance of this issue for the growth of the church to the gentile world,
    and the battles continually fought over it, we should look at Galatians. This book was the
    first written by Paul, and it clarifies in detail the position of the council and of Paul
    on the issue of the Law.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<b>

</b><i>

<p>Paul defends his apostolic authority (1:1-2:21)</p>

<p>Theological argument for salvation by faith alone (3:1-5:12)</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>2. Curse of the Law (3:10-12)</p>
  <p>3. Purpose of the Law (3:19-4:7)</p>

<p><em>Second Missionary Journey (Acts 15:36-18:22)</em></p>
</b><i>

<p>A parting of the ways between Barnabus and Paul</p>

<blockquote>
  <p></i>Paul and Barnabus dispute over Mark, who had previously abandoned the missionary
  group. Barnabus takes Mark with him back to Crete, Paul chooses Silas to colead the next
  missionary trip. The choice of Silas was of great strategic value, since Silas was from
  the Jerusalem church and could give personal testimony concerning the Jerusalem Council
  decision and the unquestioned authority of Paul. Further, Silas, like Paul was a Roman
  citizen. <i></p>
  </i>
</blockquote>
<i>

<p>Asia Minor and Greece</p>
</i>

<blockquote>
  <p>1. The apostolic band</p>
  <b><p></b>Paul always traveled with a group of men. We find mention of Timothy, Titus,
  Luke and many others. They would work with him in the teaching and evangelistic ministry.
  It also happened that when Paul left or was forced out of a city, he would leave some of
  his coworkers behind.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>2. Growing polarization (Ac. 17:1-9; 18:12-18)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Opposition at Thessalonica came from the Jews. Paul stayed only a short time, then he
  left to Berea. The Thessalonian Jews followed him there, so he left Berea also in haste.
  Paul sent the rest of the missionary team back to Thessalonica to establish the church,
  while he went on to Ahtens.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <b><p></b>a. From Thessalonica to Athens</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <i><p>Ac. 17:16-34. </i>Discuss his observations and relative failure among the
    &quot;intellectuals&quot; of his day. His stay in Athens was also short, and he went south
    to Corith. From Corinth, he wrote back to the Thessalonians. His letters reveal both some
    of his doctrinal priorities and the passion he had for the churches he established.</p>

<p>Paul at Corinth (Acts 18:1-17)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p></i>Corinth was a grossly immoral city. It is analogous in many ways to San Francisco.
  Paul ran out of money and began making tents, as was his profession. He ran into a couple,
  Priscilla and Aquilla. Paul stayed for 18 months in Corinth. His letters to this church,
  which we will discuss next week, provide a great window into the central issues that faced
  the spread of Christianity among the gentiles.<i></p>

<p><em>Third Missionary Journey (Acts 18:23-21-14)</em></p>
</b><i>

<p>Return to Ephesus</p>

<blockquote>
  <p></i>Ephesus became a very important church. It was a training ground for Paul (school
  of Tyraneas), he sent 3 letters to the church, John would later settle there.</p>
  <p>19:24-41. Conversions in Ephesus led to heated resistance against the church. The
  opposition was led by the guilds, which profited much from the pagan relic business. The
  temple to Artemis was enormous and beautiful, considered one of the 7 wonders of the
  ancient world.. A riot insued.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>Paul's trek to Rome (Acts 20:2-28:31)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p></i>Paul was to end up in Rome. That was his expressed intention (19:21). Yet how he
  would get there is another matter. It would be a circuitous route to say the least. He
  would go there by way of Jersualem, and arrive in chains after about 3 years of
  imprisonments. Fearing for his life, Paul exercised his right as a Roman citizen to have
  his case given before Caesar (Ac. 25:21).</p>
  <p>Paul's years in prison were used well. Under house arrest, he was able to entertain
  visitors, write letters (Prison Epistles), and carry on an extraordinary mission to
  Caesar&#146;s household (Phil. 1:12-20). Paul may have been able to do in chains what he
  could never have done as a free man.</p>
  <p>Acts ends without the reader knowing what happened to Paul. We know that he was
  exonerated or the charges. Yet, within two years, Paul would stand before Nero, where he
  would meet his death. The Christian community had become Nero's scapegoat for the 64 AD
  fire that nearly destroyed Rome (again).<i></p>

<p><em>Paul's letters</em></p>

<p>Use of an amenuensis (secretary)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p></i>Rom. 16:22 mentions Tertius. Paul also mentions that he wrote at various times with
  his own hand, suggesting a break with his normal method (1 Cor. 16:21; Gal. 6:11; Col.
  4:18...). That Paul used an amenuensis is also observed by the stylistic differences
  evident in various of Paul's letters.<i></p>
  </i><b>
</blockquote>
</b><i>

<p>Style of letters</p>

<blockquote>
  <p></i>Most of Paul's letters were &quot;occasional.&quot; The form is typically (i)
  Greeting, which includes the name of the author, credentials, blessings, name of
  recipient; (ii) Body, which was typically responses to problems based on theological
  truth; (iii) Conclusion, which gave greetings for others in the apostolic band.<i></p>

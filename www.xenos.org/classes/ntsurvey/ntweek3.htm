  </i><p>1. Meaning of the Law.<b> </p>
  <blockquote>
    </b></font><font face="Arial" size="3"><p>This sermon is Jesus' major teaching on the Law
    of Moses. He ascends to the top of a mountain, in the same way that Moses received the Law
    from the top of Mt. Sinai. Jesus assumes for himself a level of authority even beyond that
    of Moses, by prefacing many of his pronouncements with &quot;You have heard that the
    ancients were told (a reference Moses).....but I say...&quot; (Mt. 5:21,22). </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
</font>

<blockquote>
  <font FACE="Arial"><p>2. Jesus challenges the legalistic, externalistic interpretation of
  the Law held by Jewish scholars, and held that there was an inner demand of the Law which
  was completely forgotten by the Jews (Mt. 7:28,29).</p>

<blockquote>
  </b><p>3. Beattitudes (Matthew 5:3-12).<b> </p>
  <blockquote>
    </b><p>The blessings of the kingdom fall on the &quot;unlikely.&quot; That is, the poor,
    the sick, those whom the Pharisees refered to as the &quot;sinners.&quot; The basic thread
    that goes through the beattitudes is humility and inner sensitivity to God's moral
    priorities, such as justice and mercy. </p>
    <p>By this deeper, inner humility, Israel was to be the &quot;city set on the hill&quot;
    and &quot;salt and light&quot; to the world. That is what God intended for the Law in Ex.
    19:5,6. Israel was to be a living testimony to God for the world. The notion of being a
    witness to the gentile world was completely lost in 1st century Judaism. Jesus' disciples,
    by contrast, were to be the testimony of god to the world, who, by their good works would
    glorify God.</p>

  </b><p>4. Jesus fulfills the Law (Matthew 5:17-19).</p>

    <p>Jesus does not reject the Law or the prophets, but identifies himself as the completion

    and the message of the prophets.</p>
    <p>Internal demand of the Law (Matthew 5:20-48).</p>

<p>Parables of the Kingdom (Matthew 13)</p>

  </i><p>1. What is a parable?<b> </p>
  <blockquote>
    </b><p>An allegory taken from common experience, in which there is usually one single
    point being made. It is not unlike a fable in that sense. Each of the details of the
    parable are typically unimportant. In interpretation, we look for the main idea being
    conveyed. Interpreters since Augustine have gotten into trouble ascribing meaning to each
    aspect of the parable. Recent scholarship has shown that the parable form was to express a
    single meaning. There are exceptions to the &quot;one story, one meaning&quot; principal.
    But in interpretation, unless the text supplies more that one dimension of interpretation,
    we must be very tentative in our ascribing more than one meaning.</p>
    <b>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
</b>

<blockquote>
  <p>2.<b> </b>Why did Jesus speak in parables?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <b><p></b>Mt. 13:10-17. The hardness of heart of the Jewish religious establishment is
    contrasted with the simple understand of the believer. The simplicity of God confounds the
    genius of fallen man.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <i><p>Kingdom as a mystery</i>: Much of Jesus' teaching recorded in the Gospels surrounds
    the identification of himself as the messianic servant of God, and the pronouncement that
    the reign of God (the kingdom) has come through his ministry. Yet, the reign of God is not
    as the first century Jews had expected. The true nature of the kingdom Jesus announced was
    &quot;not of this world&quot; (John 18:36) and was shouded in mystery (Mk. 4:11; Jn.
    16:25). </p>
    <p>&quot;Mystery&quot; means something that was hidden, but which is now revealed. The
    mystery of God's rule is twofold. First that it comes to the &quot;unlikely.&quot; That is
    the message of the Sermon on the Mount. God offers his kingdom not to those who think they
    satisfy the moral requirements of the Mosaic Law, but those of humble state who recognize
    their dependence on God. Secondly, the Kingdom is a mystery in the sense that messianic
    servant would come first to <i>redeem </i>a people who would voluntarily subordinate
    themselves to his rule. The message of the suffering servant who atones for the sins of
    the people is present in the Old Testament (Is. 52, 53), but it is difficult to grasp in
    light of the more prominent message of the Davidic King who rules over the earth on behalf
    of God. The message of the atoning death of the messiah was something that can be clearly
    seen after the crucifixion of Christ, but which could not be truly understood before hand.
    That is why when Christ would speak openly of his death and resurrection, even his
    disciples wondered to themselves what he meant (Mk.8:31.32; 9:10). It is clear from the
    teaching of Christ, the testimony of his disciples, and from the message of the rest of
    scripture, that God intentionally kept hidden the true intent of Christ's mission (see
    Rom. 16:25-27; 1 Peter 1:10-12).</p>
    <p>The question of why God wanted the sacrificial death of Christ to be unknown is
    answered for us in 1 Corinthians 2:6-9. It is in the atonement that God is able to qualify
    men to enter his kingdom. Had the devil really understood this, he would not have had
    Christ crucified, knowing that the end of his claim to the earth was eminent. In his
    death, Christ put to an end the stranglehold of the Satanically-inspired rebellion against
    God. It is only now, in retrospect, that we can look back into the scripture and see
    clearly that this was God's plan all along. Now the kingdom of light and the kingdom of
    darkness exist together. But there is coming a day when Christ will return to establish
    his rule upon the earth, as the prophets of the Old Testament had envisioned. Between the
    cross and his return, Christ is expanding his kingdom by persuasion and conversion, not by
    power and coercion.</p>

  <p>4. Kingdom as present and future</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <b><p></b>Proclamation of the kingdom is a crucial aspect of Jesus' teaching. The kingdom
    is portrayed as both a present reality and a future hope. It is a present reality, in that
    God offers his rule in the lives of those who would accept his messiah, but future in the
    sense that God will one day impose his rule without the consent of those under it. The
    future kingdom is the millennial kingdom established at the end of the age.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John the Baptist announced the presence of the kingdom in the ministry of Christ (Mt.
    3:2; 4:7). Jesus makes it clear that the kingdom has come in his ministry (Mt. 12:28;
    11:12,13). At the same time, Jesus looked to the kingdom as a future hope (Mk.14:25; Mt.
    8:11; Mt. 6:10). In his teaching, Jesus offered the kingdom of god to the Jews, but on the
    spiritual basis of individual repentance and faith, rather than on a
    politico-nationalistic basis, as they had expected of their messiah. By rejecting Jesus,
    most of the Jews, including their official leaders, rejected God's rule through the
    Messiah. Consequently, God has transferred his kingdom to the believing community, the
    church (Mt. 21:42, 43; Col. 1:13; Rom. 14:17;Ac. 28:23,28-31). Yet, there remains a plan
    for Israel in the end times</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Expansion of the gospel begins in Jerusalem, and Acts traces its development to the
    center of the empire: Rome. The theme of expansion is restated all over the text (2=
    Jerusalem; 6:7= Judea; 9:3= Samaria; 12:24=Gentiles). Luke's history is selective, in that
    he does not trace the spread of Christianity throughout North Africa and Asia, as
    competent history testifies (eg: Rylands Fragment, c. 100 AD). </p>

  <p>2. Vindication of Christianity as rooted in legal Judaism.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Luke cites several favorable decisions regarding Christianity before local and
    provincial rulers. This was important, because where ever the faith spread, there was
    controversy. The riots and uprisings that accompanied the spread of the gospel (Ephesis,
    Thessalonica, etc.) were based on false accusation both by Jews and Romans. Note, finally,
    that Luke addresses this history to &quot;most excellent&quot; Theophilus, in all
    likelihood, a Roman official involved in some way with the prosecution of Paul (Festus is
    refered to as &quot;most excellent&quot; in 26:25).</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Who is this man who, in the word of the Thessalonians, &quot;has upset the world&quot;
    (Ac.17:6)? Paul was not one of Jesus' disciples. So Luke needs to establish who he is and
    why he enjoys the level of authority he does. Also, for the modern reader, Acts explains
    who the man is who is responsible for writing over half of the New Testament letters.</p>
  </blockquote>

<i>

<p>The birth of the church (ch. 1,2)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After Jesus gave the disciples their commission, they were instructed to wait for the
  Holy Spirit which would be the beginning of their ministry.</p>
  </i><p>1. Pentecost. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This is the Jewish festival 50 days after Passover and which represents the promise of
    the first harvest. </p>
    <p><i>2:1-13.</i> The Holy Spirit comes upon them in a dramatic way. A key manifestation
    is speaking in tongues. Note that the tongues were human languages (2:11) for the purpose
    of introducing the pilgrims to the message of Christ. </p>
    <i><p>2:14-36.</i> Peter uses this opportunity to stand up and explain to the people what
    they were witnessing. He cites Joel 2,3, the pronouncement that the awaited &quot;Day of
    the Lord&quot; was now here. The Holy Spirit's outpouring and tongues were proof of that.
    Then, he goes on to discuss the identity and work of God's messiah (22-36). Jesus is the
    messiah, the Lord. You are all guilty for his death, but God has vindicated his messiah by
    raising him from the dead. The central issue is thus: &quot;what will you do about
    Jesus?&quot; Note that this is the same question Jesus asked his disciples in Jn. 6:66,
    &quot;who do you say that I am?&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<i>

<p>The Jerusalem church (2:41-6:15)</p>
</i>

<blockquote>
  <b><p></b>Response to Peter's message was quick in coming (2:37-41). The people were to
  repent, accept baptism and they received the gift of the Holy Spirit. The <i>subsequent</i>
  indwelling of the Holy Spirit is recorded on four occasions in Acts (2,8,10,19). Each
  incident shows a unique advance in the progress of the Gospel. It is not intended to show
  that baptism or tongues speaking are necessary for salvation, or that the Holy Spirit
  indwells at some later time than the acceptance of Christ. In ch. 2, the Jews receive the
  Holy Spirit for the first time; in ch. 8, the Samaritans; in ch. 10, Cornelius, a Gentile;
  in ch. 19, the Ephesian followers of John the Baptist. Thus, the Pentecost scenario is
  unique, not normative. It serves to illustrate the fact that in interpreting Acts, we must
  realize that it describes what occurs, and only in sections where sermons ae recorded does
  it prescribe doctrine. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>1. Period of growth</p>
  <b><p></b>Within a few months, thousands had become part of the Christian community. They
  represented Jews from all over the Roman world. Because of their desire to sit under the
  teaching of the Apostles, to get grounded in their faith, the pilgrims became long-term
  residents of Jerusalem. </p>
  <p>2. Resistence mounts (3:1-4:31)</p>
  <p>It didn't take long before resistance from the Jewish religious establishment began to
  take form. Peter and John were the consensus leaders of the Apostles. Through their
  teaching and miracle-performing ministry, Jews in Jerusalem were being polarized. The
  Saducees became enraged, because they were teaching the resurrection (4:1,2).
  Consequently, Peter and John were jailed. Note Peter's defense (4:3-12).</p>
  <p>3. Emphases of community life (2:41-47; 4:31-5:16)</p>
  <b><p></b>There was a community in the truest sense of the word forming. Because believers
  were making decisions to stay, logistic problems were numerous. They began to sell land
  and other holdings to supply their needs, and the needs of others. They had daily teaching
  and fellowship. </p>
</blockquote>
<i>

<p>Stephen, Philip and the spread of Christianity outside of Jerusalem</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After a problem allocating resources was dealt with (6:1-7), the narrative turns to the
  ministry of Stephen and Philip. It is through Stephen's martyrdom that an all-out assault
  began on the church (8:1-3). This also gives us our first exposure to Saul (7:58, 8:1-3).
  After the church was scattered, Philip was led to share Christ with the Ethiopian eunich
  (8:26-38). The base for the Christian movement shifted from Jerusalem to Antioch. It is
  from Antioch that the Roman world would be reached for Christ. </p>

      unwilling to undergo circumcision and observe the ritual laws of Judaism. Paul taught that
      one does not have to first become a Jew to be a Christian. For the God fearers, this was a
      truly liberating message. Yet, among the Jews, Paul formed many enemies.</p>

    gentiles must first become Jews before they can be saved. That is, the Christian community
    would be completely Jewish. The Gentiles would needed to undergo circumcision, observe the
    Mosaic Law, etc. In essence, a gentile must reject his cultural as well as religious
    background. Clearly this raised theological problems (df: salvation) and well as practical
    ones.</p>

  imprisonments. Fearing for his life, Paul exercised his right as a Roman citizen to have
  his case given before Caesar (Ac. 25:21).</p>

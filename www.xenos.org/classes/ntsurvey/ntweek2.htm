<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <b><p></b>Between the close of the Old Testament era and the time of Jesus, the promise of
    a messiah became a major part of the Jewish psyche. Heartened by the heroic, if limited
    victory of the Macabean Revolution, the Jews saw the messiah through the eyes of military
    conquest. </p>

  </i><p>Pax Romana (20BC-180AD)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <b><p></b>This is the period of time from Tiberius to Marcus Arelieus. The empire was free
    of serious external threat, had it's most stable economy, and internal harmony. The Romans
    connected their empire by an extensive network of well protected roads and port cities
    around the Med. basin. The linking of diverse ethnicities by a common language was also an
    important feature of the Roman empire. These factors provided the circumstance around
    which God could effect his plan for man.</p>

    father (see Mt. 1:16, &quot;whom&quot; is fem.).</p>
    <p>Matt. traces Jesus&#146; genealogy through the kingly line, showing Jesus&#146; right

<p><i>Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7)</p>

<blockquote>
  </i><p>Meaning of the Law.<b> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p></b>This sermon is Jesus' major teaching on the Law of Moses. He ascends to the top of
    a mountain, in the same way that Moses received the Law from the top of Mt. Sinai. Jesus
    assumes for himself a level of authority even beyond that of Moses, by prefacing many of
    his pronouncements with &quot;You have heard that the ancients were told (a reference
    Moses).....but I say...&quot; (Mt. 5:21,22). </p>
    <p>Jesus challenges the legalistic, externalistic interpretation of the Law held by Jewish
    scholars, and held that there was an inner demand of the Law which was completely
    forgotten by the Jews (Mt. 7:28,29).<b></p>
  </blockquote>
  </b><p>Beatitudes (Matthew 5:3-12).<b> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p></b>The blessings of the kingdom fall on the &quot;unlikely.&quot; That is, the poor,
    the sick, those whom the Pharisees referred to as the &quot;sinners.&quot; The basic
    thread that goes through the beatitudes is humility and inner sensitivity to God's moral
    priorities, such as justice and mercy. </p>
    <p>By this deeper, inner humility, Israel was to be the &quot;city set on the hill&quot;
    and &quot;salt and light&quot; to the world. That is what God intended for the Law in Ex.
    19:5,6. Israel was to be a living testimony to God for the world. The notion of being a
    witness to the gentile world was completely lost in 1st century Judaism. Jesus' disciples,
    by contrast, were to be the testimony of god to the world, who, by their good works would
    glorify God.<b></p>
  </blockquote>
  </b><p>Jesus fulfills the Law (Matthew 5:17-19).</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Jesus does not reject the Law or the prophets, but identifies himself as the completion

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><em>Parables of the Kingdom (Matthew 13)</em></p>

<p></b><em>What is a parable?</em><b> </p>

<p></b>An allegory taken from common experience, in which there is usually one single
point being made. It is not unlike a fable in that sense. Each of the details of the
parable are typically unimportant. In interpretation, we look for the main idea being
conveyed. Interpreters since Augustine have gotten into trouble ascribing meaning to each
aspect of the parable. Recent scholarship has shown that the parable form was to express a
single meaning. There are exceptions to the &quot;one story, one meaning&quot; principle.
But in interpretation, unless the text supplies more that one dimension of interpretation,
we must be very tentative in our ascribing more than one meaning.</p>

<p><em>Why did Jesus speak in parables?</em></p>

<p>Mt. 13:10-17. The hardness of heart of the Jewish religious establishment is contrasted
with the simple understand of the believer. The simplicity of God confounds the genius of
fallen man.</p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p></i>1. Kingdom as a mystery: Much of Jesus' teaching recorded in the Gospels
  surrounds the identification of himself as the messianic servant of God, and the
  pronouncement that the reign of God (the kingdom) has come through his ministry. Yet, the
  reign of God is not as the first century Jews had expected. The true nature of the kingdom
  Jesus announced was &quot;not of this world&quot; (John 18:36) and was shrouded in mystery
  (Mk. 4:11; Jn. 16:25). </p>
  <p>&quot;Mystery&quot; means something that was hidden, but which is now revealed. The
  mystery of God's rule is twofold. First that it comes to the &quot;unlikely.&quot; That is
  the message of the Sermon on the Mount. God offers his kingdom not to those who think they
  satisfy the moral requirements of the Mosaic Law, but those of humble state who recognize
  their dependence on God. Secondly, the Kingdom is a mystery in the sense that messianic
  servant would come first to <i>redeem </i>a people who would voluntarily subordinate
  themselves to his rule. The message of the suffering servant who atones for the sins of
  the people is present in the Old Testament (Is. 52, 53), but it is difficult to grasp in
  light of the more prominent message of the Davidic King who rules over the earth on behalf
  of God. The message of the atoning death of the messiah was something that can be clearly
  seen after the crucifixion of Christ, but which could not be truly understood before hand.
  That is why when Christ would speak openly of his death and resurrection, even his
  disciples wondered to themselves what he meant (Mk. 8:31.32; 9:10). It is clear from the
  teaching of Christ, the testimony of his disciples, and from the message of the rest of
  scripture, that God intentionally kept hidden the true intent of Christ's mission (see
  Rom. 16:25-27; 1 Peter 1:10-12).</p>
  <p>The question of why God wanted the sacrificial death of Christ to be unknown is
  answered for us in 1 Corinthians 2:6-9. It is in the atonement that God is able to qualify
  men to enter his kingdom. Had the devil really understood this, he would not have had
  Christ crucified, knowing that the end of his claim to the earth was eminent. In his
  death, Christ put to an end the stranglehold of the Satanically-inspired rebellion against
  God. It is only now, in retrospect, that we can look back into the scripture and see
  clearly that this was God's plan all along. Now the kingdom of light and the kingdom of
  darkness exist together. But there is coming a day when Christ will return to establish
  his rule upon the earth, as the prophets of the Old Testament had envisioned. Between the
  cross and his return, Christ is expanding his kingdom by persuasion and conversion, not by
  power and coercion.</p>

<p></b><em>Kingdom</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1. Reign (authority to rule). </p>
  <p>2. Realm (domain of rule).<b></p>
  </b>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The kingdom is a time of peace and justice in which god will personally rule. This
  theme was the hope of the prophets. The &quot;Day of the Lord&quot; (Joel 2,3) and the
  kingdom (Dan. 2:44) refer to the same thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<b>

<p></b><em>Kingdom as present and future.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Proclamation of the kingdom is a crucial aspect of Jesus' teaching. The kingdom is
  portrayed as both a present reality and a future hope. It is a present reality, in that
  God offers his rule in the lives of those who would accept his messiah, but future in the
  sense that God will one day impose his rule without the consent of those under it. The
  future kingdom is the millennial kingdom established at the end of the age. John the
  Baptist announced the presence of the kingdom in the ministry of Christ (Mt. 3:2; 4:7).
  Jesus makes it clear that the kingdom has come in his ministry (Mt. 12:28; 11:12,13). At
  the same time, Jesus looked to the kingdom as a future hope (Mk. 14:25; Mt. 8:11; Mt.
  6:10). In his teaching, Jesus offered the kingdom of god to the Jews, but on the spiritual
  basis of individual repentance and faith, rather than on a politico-nationalistic basis,
  as they had expected of their messiah. By rejecting Jesus, most of the Jews, including
  their official leaders, rejected God's rule through the Messiah. Consequently, God has
  transferred his kingdom to the believing community, the church (Mt. 21:42, 43; Col. 1:13;
  Rom. 14:17: Ac. 28:23,28-31). Yet, there remains a plan for Israel in the end times</p>

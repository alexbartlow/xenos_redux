  resurrection of his Son. History matters! Sir William Ramsey states, &quot;Luke is a
  historian of the first rank; not merely are his statements of fact trustworthy; he is
  possessed of the true historic sense; he fixes his mind on the idea and plan that rules in
  the evolution of history, and proportions the scale of his treatment to the importance of
  each incident. He seizes the important and critical events and shows their true nature at
  greater length, while he touches lightly or omits entirely much that was valueless for his
  purpose. In short, this author should be placed along with the very greatest of
  historians.&quot; Interesting to note that Ramsey became a Christian only after decades of
  careful study of the historical narrative of Luke/Acts.</font></p>

    the emphasis on fulfilled prophecy and Jesus' critique of Jewish legalism.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">b. <i>Luke</i>. Luke wrote his gospel to gentiles, as the preface
    indicates. He focuses on the historical evidence for Jesus. For example, his references to
    Roman officials. He is also clear to document that Jesus was innocent of any crime against
    Rome. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">c.<i> John</i>. Writing to a gentile audience. His concern is more

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">Greek culture, called Hellenism was spreading all over the territory
  controlled by the Greeks. They not only conquered militarily, but they Hellenized the
  cultures which they dominated. Greek language became the dominant , official language of
  the Med. world. 70 Greek-style cities were constructed under Alexander. Worship of Greek
  deities was mandatory.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial">Division of Alexander&#146;s empire</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">When Alexander died in 323 B.C., his four leading generals took
  control of the empire. The two of importance to Palestine and biblical history were
  Ptolemy and Seleucid. The Ptolemaic Empire was centered in Egypt. The last of his dynasty
  was Cleopatra, who died in 30 BC. The Seleucid Empire was centered in Syria. Antioch was
  its capitol. Its rulers were called Seleucus or Antiochus. This empire lasted until it was
  destroyed by Pompey of Rome in 64 BC.</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">Greek attitudes toward Jewish religion</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">Jews resisted the cultural integration. Greeks viewed this as a
  problem. During the nearly 300 years of Greek domination of Palestine, Israel was a vassal
  state, with no political, military or religious autonomy. Developments in Judaism during
  this period are important if we are to understand the New Testament world. The Greeks were
  not sympathetic to the Jewish religion. The Seleucid kind Antiochus iv Epiphane (175-164
  BC) made circumcision a capital offense and began to force pagan worship at the Jewish
  temple. Many Jews, including priests were participants in this paganism. Antiochus
  appointed high priests who would conduct pagan rituals, which included drunken parades in
  honor of Cacchus, ritual prostitution and sacrifice to Greek gods. In 168, a minor revolt
  among pious Jews took place. Greek countermeasures were quick in coming. The troops of
  Antioicus destroyed much of Jerusalem, killed and enslaved many of the men and children
  and desecrated the temple once again by offering the sacrifice of a pig on the alter, and
  reinforcing worship of pagan gods.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">Maccabean Revolt </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">Resistance among the Jews came almost immediately. In the village of
  Modin, the Greeks tried to force a Jewish priest, named Matathias to offer pagan
  sacrifice. Mattathias refused. When another Jew stepped in to do the job, Mattathias
  killed him and the royal agent sent to place the demand. Mattathias then demolished the
  altar and fled to the mountains with his five sons. Many sympathizers joined them.
  Mattathias' family, known as the Hasmonians, and later the Maccabeeans, launched a
  guerrilla way against the Seleucid army (167 BC). For a short time, the Maccabeeans were
  able to reestablish worship in the Temple. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">This was a defining event in the history of Israel. The revolt
  allowed the Jews to enjoy religious freedom, a privilege that was also extended to them by
  the Romans. This will be of critical importance to the growth of the early Christian
  church. It is clear that the early Christians spread the message of Christ throughout the
  Roman empire with the understanding that Christianity is rooted in legal Judaism. For the
  last century BC and the first century AD, the Maccabean revolt distilled the religious and
  nationalistic passions of the Jews. They would never fully accept occupation by a foreign
  army. This both shaped their messianic expectation (later) and sealed their destruction.</font></p>

  was more like stew (diversity with the Roman government being the unifying dimension).
  Rome was called the &quot;cosmopolis&quot;, or world city. Emperor became associated with
  divinity (&quot;Augustus&quot;). Unconditional surrender to the awesome power of Rome
  insured &quot;pax romana.&quot;Contributions of the Romans</font></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial">i. Herod the Great (37-4 BC). An Edomite, hated by the Jews. He was
    scheming, jealous and cruel. He killed two wives and three sons. &quot;Better to be
    Herod&#146;s pig than his son.&quot; It was he, in Matthew&#146;s account, that had the
    male children of Bethlehem slaughtered. He was an absolute tyrant. He engorced curfews,
    demanded high taxes and operated a secret police to uncover any plots against him. On the
    other hand, in times of famine, he provided free grain and clothes, and contributed a
    fortune to beautify the Jewish Temple. At his death, he ordered the leading Jews be
    slaughtered so that while no one would morn <i>over</i> his death, they would <i>at</i>
    least mourn at his death--the order was not followed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">ii. Herod Antipas. This was the guy singled out for rebuke by John
    the Baptist for marrying his half sister, and who ordered up John&#146;s head on a silver
    platter (Mk. 6:17-29). Jesus stood trial before him (Lk. 23:7-12).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">iii. Agrippa I. Grandson of Herod the Great executed James,
    imprisoned Peter.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">iv. Agrippa II. Heard Paul&#146;s defense (Ac. 25,26).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Because of the mismanagement by Herod&#146;s sons, Rome sent
    governers to oversee the region. Pontuis Pilate, one such governer, condemned Jesus to

    precarious position of not offending Rome, and staying loyal to the people. Ultimately,
    the middle ground striven for by the Sanhedrin would not work. Polarized by Zealots and
    others, revolution broke the seams of Jewish society and ultimately brought about its'
    downfall.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">ii. Revolts (70, 132 AD). The nationalism and sacrifice that
    characterized the Maccabean revolution was carried on through the rest of Israel's ancient
    history. Roman governer Florus raided the temple treasury and ignited the rebellion that
    led to the destruction of Jerusalem. Explain Messada, and the Bar Cochba revolt, the
    destruction of Jerusalem and the scattering of the people.</font></p>

  Probably only 700,000 Jews in Palestine, with as 3.3 million in the Roman world. More Jews
  lived in Alexandria, Egypt than Jerusalem, more in Syria than Palestine. Even in
  Palestine, many regions, such as Galilee were populated more by non-Jews than Jews.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial">Synagogue</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">With no Temple for much of the time, and certainly no temple close
  by, the synagogue was the center of Jewish religious life. For most Jews, the rabbi
  (teacher) replaced the priest as the central religious figure. The synagogue is a
  community within a community. It is a context for education, religious identity, meeting
  social needs. Synagogues were autonomous, self-governing bodies. They were led by elders.
  The synagogue was the model for the early Christian church.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">Rabbis</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The priest played a diminished role in the religious life of most
  Jews. The reason was that Temple worship was, for most Jews either completely absent, or a
  once in a lifetime event.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial">a. Rabbinical traditions:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial">i. Hillel. Liberal views. These were rabbis that had to a
      significant extent, merged with the thought forms and culture of the pagan world. An
      example of how their commentary on the Law went can be found with divorce. The allowance
      of divorce under Moses is interpreted by the Hillel school as &quot;for any reason
      whatsoever.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">ii. Shammai. Conservative views. Only strict observance of the Law
      will prevent another destruction for the Jews. So the Law, especially the Sabbath laws
      were spelled out in thousands of details. What, for example would constitute
      &quot;work&quot; on the Sabbath? Eg: spitting, dragging a chair, etc.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">By the time of Christ, the words of the rabbis carried as much
  authority as the scripture itself, at least in the practice of Judaism. That is why Jesus
  would contrast the rabbis words with his own by saying &quot;you have heard it
  said....&quot;and &quot;truly truly (amen, amen) I say to you.&quot;</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">b. <i>Matthew 2:1; Luke 1:5.</i> Herod the Great was still alive.
    Herod was proclaimed king of the Jews by the Roman Senate in late 40 BC. Josephus
    (Antiquities, xvii. 8.1) states that an eclipse of the moon occurred shortly before
    Herod's death. It is the only eclipse ever mentioned by Josephus, and we know it to have
    occurred on March 12, 4 BC.After his death there was a celebration of Passover, on April
    11, 4 BC. So, his death occurred between March 12 and April 11, 4 BC. Therefore, Christ
    could not have been born later than April 11, 4 BC. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">c. <i>Luke 2:1-5</i>. A census was taken just before Christ's birth.
    The purpose of the census was to provide statistical data for the levy of taxes. This was
    of particular importance during the last few years of Herod's rule, because his kingdom
    had become unstable (he changed his will three times, and executed much of his family who
    were vying for his throne). Further, in 8/7 BC, Herod came into disfavor with Augustus and
    was treated as a subject rather than a friend. With his autonomy taken away, Rome would
    have had reason to take a census.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">d. This places the birth of Christ in late 5/4 BC in Bethleham

<blockquote>
  <p>Question: Who among you is wise and understanding?</p>
  <p><strong><u>Answer</u></strong><strong>: Let him <em>show</em> (wisdom) by good behavior <em>deeds</em> in the   gentleness of wisdom</strong>. (see 2:18-20 for this theme in the book)</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Test: <em>But</em> if you  have bitter jealousy, selfish ambition in your heart,   do  not be arrogant and lie against the truth.</p>
    <p> Diagnosis: This wisdom is not from above, but earthly, natural, demonic.</p>
    <p> Prognosis: For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is   disorder and  every evil thing.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong><u>Evidence</u></strong>: But the wisdom from above is first pure,  then peaceable, gentle,   reasonable, full of mercy and good  fruits, unwavering, without   hypocrisy. And the seed whose fruit is righteousness is  sown in  peace  by those who make peace. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is  wisdom?  </p>
  <blockquote><p><em>Sophia. </em>A practical,  learned excellence in the art of living; an insight into  the true nature of things. It is <em>cultivated</em> like a seed becoming fruit (3:18).</p>
    <p>&ldquo;from above,&rdquo; God&rsquo;s wisdom, is  rooted in the fear of the Lord (Prov. 1:7 an  attitude  of the heart), in obedient action (Deut. 4:5,6 exercising the will); in  acknowledging him (Prov. 3:6,7 intellectual  mind set). </p>
    <p>&ldquo;from below,&rdquo; earthly (<em>epigeios</em>, the source) natural (<em>psychikos</em>,  characteristics are unspiritual, doesn&rsquo;t take the  supernatural into account),  demonic  (<em>diamoniodes</em>, evil, opposing God, the  promise of wisdom without  God, Gen.  3:5,6).</p>

<h3><strong> Issues  In Hermeneutics: Interpreting Ethical Teaching</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p><em>Ethical teaching is within a context. </em>Moral  instruction comes to a particular people, at a particular time and place, often  for a particular purpose. </p>
<p><em>Our question: How do you arrive at transcultural moral  principles from teaching that originates within a specific cultural and  theological context?</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Cultural  context relates to moral teaching</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Accommodating </em>morality to existing social conditions. For instance, Jesus&rsquo; teaching on divorce  (Matthew 19:7-9; also Mal. 2:16) includes a comment on Deuteronomy 24:1-4,  explaining <em>why</em> Moses allowed for  divorce under certain circumstances. </li>
  <li>  Laws as <em>president</em> to be applied by analogy, not  prescription. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Theological context relates to moral teaching
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Principles of  living for the people of God: &ldquo;A kingdom of priests&ldquo; (Exodus 19:6); &ldquo;In Christ&rdquo;  (Galatians 3:28), who possess God&rsquo;s resources to act (Colossians 3:12ff). 
  </li>
  <li>The center and focus of biblical ethical teaching is to God&rsquo;s covenant  people (note 1 Cor. 5:12,13). This does <em>not </em>mean that there are no moral truths  relating to all people in all places at all times. The Bible <em>presumes</em> a moral order discernable by all peoples for which they are accountable before  God (Rom. 1:18-21) and evidenced by rather uniform moral codes across all  cultures throughout history (see for example C.S. Lewis, <em>The Abolition of Man</em>, 95&mdash;121).
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em>Three  Hermeneutical Principles for Identifying Universal Moral Truths</em></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>1. <strong><u>Basis  and Substance</u></strong><u>: God&rsquo;s essential character</u>. Ex. 34:6-8; Matt. 5:48; Jas. 1:17; Mal. 3:6</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Transcendence of God in relation to ancient near east polytheism/animism</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The world of society, nature and the gods interpenetrate in such a way  that the <em>status quo</em> is the focus of  attention. The aim of the gods is to  preserve the established order, and the whole cultic and social life of man is  primarily aimed at integration with the world.  In Egyptian wisdom literature, for example, the contrast repeatedly made  is between the &lsquo;passionate man&rsquo; and the &lsquo;silent man.&rsquo; The latter is the successful man because he  is always calm and never a disturber or the established order.... It is small  wonder, therefore, that all polytheisms tend to be religions of the <em>status quo</em>, and that none of them has  ever produced a thoroughgoing social revolution based upon a high concept of  social justice. Revolution of any sort  is abhorrent to the inmost nature of such natural religion. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> G.E. Wright, <em>The  Old Testament Against It&rsquo;s Environment</em></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Relational dynamic in biblical ethical teaching</em>. Moral teaching in scripture  connects a personal God to His people.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To the prophet, God does not reveal himself in an abstract absoluteness,  but in a personal and intimate relation to the world. <em>Pathos</em> is not an idea of goodness, but a living care; not an immutable example, but a  dynamic relationship between God and man...  Having an idea of friendship is not the same as having a friend or  living with a friend, and the story of a friendship cannot be fully told by  what one friend thinks of the being and attributes of the other friend.</p>
  <p>It is because God is the source of justice that His pathos is ethical;  and it is because God is absolutely personal&mdash;devoid of anything impersonal&mdash;that  this ethos is full of pathos. Pathos,  then, is not an attitude taken arbitrarily. Its inner law is the moral law; ethos is  inherent in pathos. God is concerned  about the world, and shares in its fate.  Indeed, this is the essence of God&rsquo;s moral nature: His willingness to be  intimately involved in the history of man.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Abraham Heschel, <em>The Prophets</em>, 288, 289, 290</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The ethical  priorities of scripture also differ substantially from the legal codes of the  ancient near east:</p>
  <p>The difference between God&rsquo;s value system and that of contemporary  humanly formulated law codes [is that the latter] made property matters a capital  offense but were more lenient in regard to the violation of human life.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Terrance  Tiessen, &ldquo;Toward a hermeneutic for discerning universal   moral  absolutes,&rdquo; <em>J.E.T.S.</em> 1993:194.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em><u>Universal Principle</u></em><em>: Love, the substance of biblical ethics and the heart  of godliness. </em>Deut. 10:14,15; Is. 43:4; Hos. 11:1....  Gal. 5:22; 1 John 4:7,8; Matt. 22:36-40. </p>
  <p>Father/child  relationship. &ldquo;...forgive as your father  in heaven...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Husband/wife. &ldquo;love your wife as Christ loved the  church...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One another&rdquo;  imperatives for Christian community are rooted in the reality that we are  &ldquo;members of one another&rdquo; (Rom. 12:5). 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>2. <strong><u>Unity</u></strong><u> of scripture: Intertextual dynamic</u>. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Trajectory.</em> Is there &ldquo;redemptive movement&rdquo; within the moral teaching of scripture? </p>
  <p>  Aspects of the biblical text were not written to  establish a utopian society with complete justice and equity, they were written  within a cultural framework with limited moves toward an ultimate ethic. 
  </p>

<p><em>Hierarchy.</em> In a broken and chaotic world, ethical principles will conflict. What are the principles that take precedence  over others? What are the &ldquo;weightier  provisions of the Law&rdquo;? &ldquo;Sabbath was  made for man, not man for the Sabbath.&rdquo;  Ethical priorities are also weighed in light of the evangelistic  imperative (1 Cor. 6:5-7; 9:19-23).</p>
<p>3. <strong><u>Teleios</u></strong><u>,  nature and ethics: God&rsquo;s design</u>.</p>
<p>Nature and  &ldquo;human nature.&rdquo; God created humans to  bear his image (Gen. 1:26). So there is  an objective meaning for &ldquo;person&rdquo; and a <em>design</em> (<em>teleios</em>) for human behavior.</p>
<p>Nature is not  blind to purpose, but reflects the personal Creator who will redeem it (Romans  8:19ff). All things are created to  operate within the framework of their nature.  Humans, with free will and living in a fallen state, have the capacity  to defy God&rsquo;s design, but not without the natural consequence of these  decisions. </p>
<p><em>Some reflections on a difficult topic: homosexuality </em> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Is there a  discernable trajectory in scripture?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The teaching of scripture, both Old Testament and New, is uniformly  negative about homosexuality (see Leviticus 18-20; Romans 1:26,27; 1 Corinthians 6:9; 1 Timothy  1:10). In light of the permissive view  of homosexuality in the Roman world, New Testament teaching stands outside the  cultural mainstream. </p>
    <p>In  1 Cor. 6, Paul is describing a whole set of moral failures common to the  Corinthians. In that context, he includes, <em>malaokois (tr. </em>effeminate<em>) </em>and <em>arsenokoitai</em> (<em>tr.</em> homosexuals). There is some  legitimate disagreement on the particulars of these two Greek words. Are <em>malaokois</em> male prostitutes as some commentators suggest? That is certainly  possible. But the word means, &ldquo;soft.&rdquo; &ldquo;Effeminate&rdquo; is a pretty good  translation of the word and indeed the technical term for a male prostitutes is  not <em>malaokois</em>. Most commentators, based on wider use of the term  in historical context, view the <em>malaokois</em> as the passive partner in a  homosexual encounter. <em>Arsenokoitai </em>is a compound of two words:  &ldquo;male&rdquo; and &ldquo;intercourse.&rdquo; <em>Koitai</em> (coitus) is slang and vulgar in  historic usage. &ldquo;Homosexual&rdquo; is a very literal translation of this  word. Both in the context of 1 Corinthians 6 (and 1 Timothy 1:10) and in  the meaning of the term itself, <em>arsenoloitai</em> is certainly a homosexual  sin and most probably referring to the active counterpart of <em>malaokois</em>,  the passive partner in homosexual activity (see Gordon Fee&rsquo;s excellent  commentary on 1 Corinthians, pp. 244ff.). So homosexual behavior is being  identified and Paul is calling on the churches to flee such conduct. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Argument from  nature&mdash;Rom. 1: 26,27</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>What do we mean  by &ldquo;natural&rdquo;?</p>
  <p>The  point of Romans 1 and 2 is to show that people with and without the Law are  without excuse before God&mdash;that the witness of nature and the testimony of  Mosaic Law both reveal human guilt. So it is within that context that  Paul describes human sin known apart from the Law. </p>
  <p>The  logic of Paul&rsquo;s argument is that fallen people, who did not &ldquo;acknowledge God&rdquo;  or &ldquo;give thanks to him,&rdquo; were &ldquo;given over&rdquo; or began to be driven by &ldquo;the lusts  of their hearts to impurity&rdquo; and &ldquo;degrading passions.&rdquo; In this context,  Paul brings in the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; and &ldquo;unnatural&rdquo; categories as expressions of human  corruption from God&rsquo;s design for sexual relations. The point here has  nothing to do with cultic practices in pagan temples as some have argued&mdash;it has  to do with what is <em>natural</em> and <em>unnatural</em> relative to God&rsquo;s design  and intent in creation. And it should also be noted that the list of  things that evidence human depravity do not end with sexual sins, but Paul goes  on to identify all kinds of inward attitudes and outward injustices as well. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Natural&rdquo; in today&rsquo;s usage seems to be  something like the common expression, &ldquo;what comes to you naturally&rdquo;&mdash; that is,  what seems normal for you; something that has always been there, that it is  just a part of your view of yourself and the way you feel. But that&rsquo;s really <em>not</em> the way the  ancient world in general or the Bible in particular understood &ldquo;nature&rdquo; or  &ldquo;natural.&rdquo; Nature included the idea of <em>normative design</em>&mdash;the nature  of things being the result of intentionality or purpose. Greeks called it  &ldquo;form,&rdquo; a teleological or design principle in nature itself. Similarly,  the Bible views nature as the product of God&rsquo;s creativity and personhood,  culminating in the apex of creation: humanity in his image. This concept  of nature includes standards or norms&mdash;<em>the &ldquo;oughts&rdquo; of nature. </em>The  issue is <u>not</u> <em>what comes naturally to you</em> in the post-Freudian  sense, but <em><u>what is the appropriate purpose of something</u></em> in God&rsquo;s  design. That there is a normative purpose for sex is clear in Genesis 1,  2&mdash;sexual complimentarity as a reflection of God&rsquo;s image, two becoming one  flesh, family and the blessing of children. That the normative purpose  for sex was broken in the fall is clear in Romans 1. Regardless of how  &ldquo;natural&rdquo; the gay impulse or orientation feels, it is not &ldquo;natural&rdquo; in the  biblical sense. </p>
  <p>This is a  sensitive and difficult subject today.  The sentiments below are worth consideration:  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Within a pluralistic society, such as we experience today, Christians  should actually defend the rights and freedoms of homosexuals to live out their  beliefs. We should not legally impose  our sexual ethic on others. Furthermore,  the emerging biological and environmental research suggests that for some  individuals the degree of non-volitional disposition toward homoerotic behavior  is quite strong. For others it is simply  a matter of personal choice, not clouded by volitional issues. Even within a negative assessment we must  recognize a sliding scale of culpability, as a Christian ethic does in other  areas where non-volitional factors influence a particular behavior. </p>

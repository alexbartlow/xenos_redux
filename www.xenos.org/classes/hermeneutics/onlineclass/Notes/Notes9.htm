<p><strong> Exercise:  1 Corinthians 15 Resurrection &amp; the  Logic of Belief</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>15:1,2 Introduction&mdash;the <em>heart of the gospel</em> message</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>15:3&mdash;11 <em>Fact</em> of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection&mdash;the evidence of scripture &amp;  eyewitness </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong></strong>Exhibit A Scripture</li>
  <li><strong></strong>Exhibit A Appeared to Peter<strong></strong></li>
  <li><strong></strong>Exhibit B Appeared to the 12<strong></strong><strong></strong></li>
  <li>Exhibit C Appeared to 500 in  Jerusalem, some who remain<strong></strong></li>
  <li><strong></strong>Exhibit D Appeared to James and the  apostles<strong></strong></li>
  <li><strong></strong>Exhibit E Appeared to Paul, the  undeserving servant of Christ<strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong><strong>15:12&mdash;19 <em>Necessity</em> of the resurrection: <u>if</u> there is <em>no</em> resurrection, <u>then</u>...</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Implication A  Christ  has not been raised, contrary to the facts of vss.3-11</li>
  <li>Implication B  Vanity  of preaching and faith in Christ  </li>
  <li>Implication C  Paul  is a false witness </li>
  <li>Implication D  Dead  are truly dead&mdash;the grave is the end
  </li>
  <li>Implication E  Faith  in Christ is pitiful</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>15:20&mdash;28 <em>Hope</em> in the resurrection: 15:20a &ldquo;but now Christ <u>has</u> been  raised&rdquo;</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li> Christ raised  as first fruits, promising a future harvest</li>
  <li>Both death and  resurrection brought through one man</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong><strong>15:30&mdash;34 <em>Motivations</em>: &ldquo;Why are we in danger every hour?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong></strong>No reason for  avoidable suffering if this life is all there is<strong> </strong></li>
  <li><strong></strong>Be sober minded</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong><strong>15:35&mdash;49 What is a resurrected  body?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Like a seed,  the body must die first to produce new fruit
    <ul>
      <li>Adam became a living soul (Genesis 1:26-28)</li>
      <li>The &ldquo;second Adam&rdquo; a life-giving spirit (see also  Romans 5:12&mdash;19)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>15:50&mdash;57  Resurrection to life <em>immortal</em> and <em>imperishable</em></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong></strong>Perishable  cannot inherit the imperishable kingdom</li>
  <li>Mystery:  trumpet will blast, the dead will rise to immortality, then those alive will be  transformed (see also 1 Thessalonians 5:13&mdash;18).
  </li>
  <li>What a victory  over death! </li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong><strong>15:58 Be steadfast and  immovable, knowing our toil is not in vain</strong></p>

<p><strong>Christianity and the Greco-Roman Religious World View</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Much of  Christian doctrine became clarified and written in the context of difficult  debate.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>Greek Dualism. </em>Reality is divided into the spiritual and the  physical. Humans are spirits encased (or  enslaved) in a body. </p>

<p><em>Cyclical view of history. </em>The theory of eternal recurrence, that the cycle of  both nature and history is eternal and unchanging. There is no ultimate purpose to human history,  as it is not really going anywhere. Importance  of biblical eschatology (1 Thess. 4:13-5:11).  the biblical hope of the Kingdom of God is a linear view of  history. That is, there is a beginning  point (Gen. 1:1), followed by a meaningful sequence of events, culminating in  the parousia.<strong></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Example of cultural and theological  analysis: 1 Timothy 1:12&mdash;17 </em></p>
<p>I thank Christ  Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because He considered me faithful,  putting me into service, even though I was formerly blasphemer and a persecutor  and a violent aggressor. Yet I was shown  mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief; and the grace of our Lord was  more than abundant, with the faith and love which are found in Christ  Jesus. It is a trustworthy statement,  deserving full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save  sinner, among whom I as foremost of all.  Yet for this reason I found mercy, so that in me as the foremost, Jesus  Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience as an example for those who would  believe in Him for eternal life. Now to  the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever  and ever. Amen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;King  eternal&rdquo;&mdash;a key word (<em>basileia</em>)&mdash;sovereign,  ruler, king
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Note central  importance of the Kingship of Christ:
    <ul>
      <li>In the O.T.  (Isaiah 9:6,7; 11:1&mdash;10; Psalm 2)</li>
      <li>In the gospels  (&ldquo;Son of David&rdquo;, Matthew 25:34,40&hellip;)</li>
      <li>In the epistles  (1 Timothy 6:15; Revelation 15:3; 17:14; 19:16&hellip;)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Glory&rdquo;&mdash;a key  word (<em>doxa</em>)&mdash;bestowing honor to one  who is superior</p>
<ul>
  <li>  The eternal  King is worthy of all praise
    <blockquote>
      <p>In the O.T. the  presence of divine glory in the tabernacle (Ex. 40:34); Moses is allowed to see  the glory of God (Ex. 24:9&mdash;17)&hellip; </p>
      <p>  In the N.T. the  glory of God was manifest in Christ (Lk. 9:28&mdash;36; Heb. 1:3)
      </p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>State the  theological meaning of main point and supporting points</em></strong></p>
<p><em></em>Example from 1  Timothy 1:12&mdash;17 A Prayer of Paul </p>
<p><u>Main point</u>: Begins and ends with<em> praising  God</em> (v. 12, 17)</p>
<ul>
  <li>  The Lord is  indeed worthy of our praise! The main  point focuses on the absolute &ldquo;otherness&rdquo; of Christ, as eternal, invisible, and  immortal. Yet, at the same time, He is  our King and Lord&mdash;he relates to us in history and personally.
  </li>
  <li>  Note the  details of word study on &ldquo;King&rdquo; and &ldquo;glory&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Gratitude is  the only appropriate, sane, response to genuine understanding of the greatness  of Christ.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Supporting Point #1</u>: We praise him  because he gives us strength (v. 12)</p>
<ul>
  <li>  Note that we  operate on the basis of the power of the invisible, eternal, immortal  King. (that&rsquo;s why we can &ldquo;do all  things&rdquo; Phil. 4:13)</li>
  <li>Specifically,  his strength is evident in:
    <ul>
      <li>Putting us in  his service&mdash;no one is qualified to be God&rsquo;s servant, yet what a privilege it  is.</li>
      <li>In his eternal  being, he has more grace and mercy than I have sin
        <p>Note that Paul  does not deny responsibility in his ignorance (that&rsquo;s why he is the foremost of  sinners)&mdash;it is a culpable ignorance, especially since he was part of the  religious elite. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><u>Supporting Point #2</u>: We praise  him because of his redemptive power (v. 15)</p>
<ul>
  <li>An <em>a fortiori</em> argument&mdash;if Christ can save  Paul, he can save anyone!
  </li>
  <li>The Judge of  the universe is patient&mdash;note the repeated formula of the O.T., as Jonah said,  &ldquo;for I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and  abundant in lovingkindness, and one who relents concerning calamity&rdquo; (Jonah  4:2).</li>
  <li>If we  understand, as Paul did so keenly, the depth of our sin, we will be driven by  gratitude and thanks to Christ.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em>Application (Skin)</em></strong></p>
<p>How does the  argument of the paragraph affect the original audience (and ours) in terms of  actions, attitudes, convictions?
</p>
<p>Example 1  Timothy 1:12&mdash;17
</p>
As Paul  encourages Timothy in the next paragraph to &ldquo;fight the good fight&rdquo;, it is  crucial for him to know why and how.  This prayer of Paul&rsquo;s supplies it for him:
<ul>
  <li><em>Gratitude motivated</em>&mdash;How  extraordinary is Christ&rsquo;s salvation, that we have not only forgiveness, but the  honor to be pressed into the service of the King!</li>
  <li><em>Divinely empowered</em>&mdash;It is Christ  who strengthens us. Timothy was all too  aware of his fear and anxiety. </li>
  <li><em>Drawing focus to the Lord</em>&mdash;in contrast to the human speculation characteristic of the religion  practiced by so many in Ephesus&mdash;and U.S.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>Context and  paragraphs. In pointing <em>these things</em> out (relating context of  4:1&mdash;5)</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>you will be<strong> a good servant of Christ Jesus</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p>(HOW) <em>constantly  nourished on the words of the faith and sound doctrine</em></p>
<p><u>which</u> you have been  following.</p>
<p> (CONTRAST) <u>But</u> have nothing  to do with worldly fables fit for old women.
<br />
</p>
<p>(HOW) <u>On the other hand</u>, <em>discipline yourself for the purpose of  godliness</em>;</p>
<p> <u>for</u> bodily  discipline is only of little profit,</p>
<p> <u>but</u> godliness is  profitable for all things,</p>
<p><img width="198" height="94" src="/classes/hermeneutics/Onlineclass/Notes/graphics/image004_000.gif" alt="Rectangular Callout: Why godliness is profitable" /><u>since</u> it holds promise in this life and the future life.</p>
<p>It is a  trustworthy saying, deserving full acceptance.</p>
<p> <u>For</u> this is why we labor and strive,</p>
<p><u>because</u> we fixed our hope on God, the Savior of all men, especially believers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(HOW)<em> Prescribe and teach these  things</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(HOW) <em>Let no one look down on your youthfulness</em>,</p>
<p><u>but rather</u> in speech, conduct, love, faith and purity, </p>
<p></p>
<p>(HOW) <em>show yourself as an example to believers.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>(HOW) <em>Give attention to the public reading of  scripture,</em></p>
<p><em> to exhortation and  teaching.</em><br />
</p>
<p>(HOW) <em>Do not neglect the spiritual gift in you</em>,</p>
<p> <u>which</u> was bestowed through  prophetic utterance </p>
<p> <u>and</u> laying on of hands by the  presbytery.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(HOW)<em> Take pains with these things and be  absorbed in them</em>,</p>
<p><strong>[result]</strong> <u>so that</u> your progress will be evident to all.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(HOW) <em>Pay close attention to yourself and your teaching</em>;</p>
<p> <em>persevere  in these things</em>;
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>[result]</strong> <u>for</u> as  you do, you will insure salvation for yourself <u>and</u> your hearers</p>
<p><strong> 1  Timothy 4:6&mdash;16 The Good Servant of Christ</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><u>Main Point:</u> We, like Timothy, are called to be &ldquo;good servants.&rdquo; See Matt. 25:21; I Cor 4.12</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;good&rdquo; (<em>kalos</em>)&mdash;a faithful servant. We are all called to be servants, but what  does this look like? This passage  relates to key skills and character qualities</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><u>Supporting Point #1:</u> <strong><em>Servant&rsquo;s nourishment</em></strong><u></u></p>
<p> How? <em>By continuing to drink deep from  words of faith and sound doctrine</em></p>
<ul>
  <li><em></em>&ldquo;sound&rdquo; (<em>hugiaino</em>)&mdash;healthy, as Jesus&rsquo; words  produce health and restoration (cf. Luke 18:42)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><em>Antithesis</em>: worldly fables (<em>mythos</em>) fit for old women</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Application  point</u>: you can&rsquo;t give what you don&rsquo;t have. As you are fed  by God&rsquo;s word, it spills over into effective ministry to others</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Supporting  Point #2:</u> <strong><em>Servant&rsquo;s  discipline</em></strong></p>
<p><u></u></p>
<p> Why? <em>For the purpose of </em>(<em>eusebeia</em>)--<em>god-likeness</em></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Antithesis</em>: bodily discipline is of little  profit</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>But true god-likeness  is profitable:</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Promise of life  (<em>zoe</em>) now and in the future</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>We labor and  strive in hope, because God is the Savior of all</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><u>Application  point</u>: basis of our labor is the hope of Christ in this  life and the next life&mdash;the gospel is all about life</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Supporting  Point #3:</u> <strong><em>Servant&rsquo;s  priorities</em></strong><u></u></p>
<p> </p>
<p> What it looks like: <em>being  an example</em> to the believers</p>
<ul>
  <li>In speech,  conduct, love, faith purity</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>In <em>public reading of scripture</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>In<em> hard work in your area of gifting</em>:  (note: commission; cf. 1 Tim. 1:18; 2 Tim. 1:6; Acts 13:2,3; Acts 6:6).  &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; is not in the original</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Effect of a godly servant:</p>
<ul>
  <li>affirmation&mdash;progress  made evident to all</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>persevere, thus  insuring salvation (<em>sozo</em>) to hearers</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Application point</u>: Substance and  focal point of our labors for Christ grow through character</p>

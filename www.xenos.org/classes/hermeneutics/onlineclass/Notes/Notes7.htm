      <li>vs. 17,18. <u>But</u>: Beware of men who will  take you to the courts, scourge you in  the synagogues, and before Roman officials
        <ul>

<ul>
  <li>Jesus is the  messiah, Son of David&mdash;all elements of the scene indicate this</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Supporting points:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Entry into  Jerusalem fulfills Zech. 9:9; &ldquo;Branch of Yahweh&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Multitude  recognize Jesus as &ldquo;Son of David&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Theology</em></p>
<p>For the first time in his <em>public</em> ministry, Jesus intentionally sets himself forth as the  awaited messiah, the &ldquo;Son of David&rdquo;.  Yet, this fulfillment has much irony which was almost certainly lost on  the original participants in this event.  Jesus directly fulfills Zechariah 9:9, anticipating the messiah coming  as king, bringing salvation to Jerusalem, and mounted <em>humbly</em> on a colt. Laying <em>branches</em> before the messiah symbolically  connects the hope of messiah with the &ldquo;Branch of David&rdquo; (Jer. 23:5; Is.  11:1,2,10; Zech. 3:8&mdash;10). The crowd cites  Psalm 118:25, 26. &ldquo;Hosanna&rdquo; means &ldquo;Lord  save us&rdquo; (Ps. 118:25), followed by &ldquo;Blessed is the one who comes in the name of  the Lord.&rdquo; The whole text of Ps.  118:22&mdash;28 seems uniquely relevant and prophetic. It is a hymn sung at one of the key festivals  of the Jews, probably Passover&mdash;which in context clearly has symbolic  significance. So Jesus, the &ldquo;rejected  cornerstone&rdquo; is to be the sacrifice bound to the altar. </p>

<p><em>Main point:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Cleansing the  temple for its true purpose, as a confrontation with the religious officials  that misrepresent its purpose</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Supporting points:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Cleansing the temple  is in keeping with the tradition of prophetic denunciation such as in Isaiah&rsquo;s  day (v.13 cf. Jeremiah 7:11)</li>
  <li>More signs from  Jesus in healing the blind and lame (v.14)</li>
  <li>Child&rsquo;s faith  again affirmed (v.15,16, cf. Psalm 8:2)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Theology:</em></p>
<p>When the messiah comes, he is to anoint the temple  (Dan. 9:24 and related passages). But in  this scene, Jesus does not consecrate the temple, but confronts it for its  hypocrisy. This event is another  instance of confronting the religious who are far from the kingdom. The discussion in vs. 23&mdash;27 clearly draw  importance on the issue of authority&mdash;an issue that pervades Jesus&rsquo;  ministry. The children&rsquo;s faith and the  signs performed, again, demonstrate the truth of Jesus&rsquo; witness and the  emptiness of Jewish formalistic religion. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Jesus&rsquo;  disciples called to a true, effective faith (v.22)</li>

<ul>
  <li>Contrast of  Israel&rsquo;s failed faith&mdash;the symbolic imagery of the fig tree</li>
  <li>Israel (the fig  tree) is condemned to fruitlessness</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Theology:</em></p>
<p>Fig tree as Israel (in context of previous scene; also Hosea 9:10;  Jeremiah 8:13 use the same imagery in relation to Israel, and the latter, in  relation to God&rsquo;s judgment of the nation).  Israel was to bear the fruit of being God&rsquo;s unique covenant people. They failed to obey God&rsquo;s law and did not  live as a witness of God to the watching world.  So Jesus pronounces judgment on Israel and shifts his attention to his  disciples, who will carry on the work of the kingdom.Effect of believing prayer  rooted in true belief, not ritual. </p>

<h3><strong>Outlining gospels<em> extended dialogue</em></strong><em>. </em></h3>
<p>Extended dialogue is a very common technique in  the gospels. Interpreters will want to  pay close attention to the flow of conversation, looking for how Jesus develops  theology in the context of conversation.  Extended dialogue is different than narrative in that it is much longer  than a simple narrative and focuses almost entirely on Jesus making a <em>claim</em>, then clarifying its meaning in  the context of uncomprehending disciples or hostile religious authorities. </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong>Gospels Content (muscle)</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em>Historical/Cultural</em></strong> understanding.  Note two points of emphasis in interpreting the  gospels. <em>First</em>, Jesus is teaching through what he <em>does</em>&mdash;there is usually a significance behind his actions best  understood against the background of contemporary messianic expectation,  religious attitudes, and Old Testament fulfillment (see the &ldquo;parabolic actions  of Christ,&rdquo; p. 77). <em>Second</em>, we see in the <em>character  development</em> of the narrative key insights into the life of faith or  faithlessness, belief or unbelief. What  is the appropriate response to Jesus and his teaching? The human response to Jesus both instructs  about the nature of faith and provides a very intentional window into how the  narrative is to be applied. In reading  the gospels interpreters need to understand how Jesus&rsquo; actions and words elicited  the responses they did and why. </p>
<p>See Craig Keener,<em> IVP Bible Background Commentary; </em>Robert  Gundry,<em> Survey of the New Testament. </em></p>
<p><strong><em>Language.</em></strong> Identify  and define key words used in the text.  This would relate to places, people, objects, and actions. Interpreters need to define these words,  noting their cultural meaning as well as how they may be used in the gospel as  a whole or in the New Testament. 
</p>
<p><strong><em>Theology</em></strong>. The  gospels are deeply theologically contentful.  Interpreters will want to identify what the text teaches about the  nature of salvation, God, discipleship, and the kingdom. To provide some deeper insight into gospels  theology, we consider three central areas: fulfillment, <em>kingdom</em>, and the <em>Fatherhood of  God</em>. </p>

<p><strong><em>Case Study: Matthew 2:15</em></strong></p>
<p><em>key interpretative questions:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>How  does Matthew understand Hosea 11:1 to be <em>fulfilled</em> in Jesus&rsquo; family&rsquo;s flight to Egypt? How  is Hosea&rsquo;s text legitimately messianic?</li>
  <li>Is  Matthew&rsquo;s use of Hosea consistent with the prophet&rsquo;s own interpretative  approach to Exodus 4:22 and Numbers 24:8?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><em>Observations from Hosea</em></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Context</em> of  Hosea 11 within the flow of the book:  Hosea  11 is one of the three major oracles of blessing after God&rsquo;s case against  Israel is declared (4:1). In contrast to  Israel&rsquo;s unfaithfulness and the exile to which they will go, God cares for and  will <em>preserve</em> Israel (6:1&mdash;3; 11:1&mdash;11;  14:1&mdash;9).</li>
  <li><em>Informing theology:</em> &ldquo;My son.&rdquo;  Israel as God&rsquo;s son was an accepted technical term (Exod. 4:22,23; Num.  24:8). The many were represented by the  singular, &ldquo;son.&rdquo; And the one  representing the many is an established messianic term (2 Samuel 7:14; Psalm  2:7; Isaiah 9:6).</li>
  <li><em>Prophetic concept of history:</em> Hosea uses Israel&rsquo;s departure from Egypt as a  reminder of God&rsquo;s <em>ongoing exodus hope</em> for his people (Isaiah 11;11) through the Davidic King (Isaiah 11:1&mdash;5). For  Hosea, Egypt is synonymous with Assyria (metonymic parallelism 9:3; see Ps.  114:1&mdash;3). Egypt is thus a <em>symbol</em> of bondage (8;13; 9:3, 6; 11:3&mdash;5;  12:13). See also Rev. 11:8.</li>
  <li><em>Hosea&rsquo;s prophetic message:</em> Consistent with the prophetic understanding of  history, Israel&rsquo;s hope, rooted in the historic past, will look to the future  exodus of God from the current &ldquo;Egypt.&rdquo; <em>The past overflows into the future as  history fulfills God&rsquo;s redemption. </em>And by invoking the <em>part </em>of the motif that fits the situation, the <em>entire</em> meaning of the motif is presumed by the author. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><em>Matthew 2 and the use of Hosea 11:1</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Matthew  looks to the exodus theme as it unfolds in the prophets, using exactly the same  view of history:</p>
  <p>Just as  under Moses God preserved his <em>son</em> in  Egypt and &ldquo;called out my son,&rdquo; so, Hosea declares, he will again under Assyrian  (Egypt) captivity with a new exodus. In  Matthew, as Son in the<em> fullest</em> sense,  Jesus completes (pleroo) the motif&mdash;as his ministry also bears witness. As Hosea fits into the broader prophetic  motif of exodus, which includes an explicit messianic dimension (Isaiah 11;  Jeremiah 23), Matthew is invoking that part of the motif that fits the  situation he is describing in the Gospel narrative of Jesus. But by invoking part of the motif, the  assumption is that it carries the breadth of the motif&rsquo;s meaning. </p>
  <p>Both  Hosea and Matthew understand that God preserves his &ldquo;son&rdquo; in &ldquo;Egypt&rdquo; and  anticipates the time when the Lord will &ldquo;call out my son.&rdquo; In this sense Matthew uses Hosea 11 in the <em>same</em> sense Hosea used Exodus 4 and  Numbers 24.</p>
  <p>No  rabbinic approach such as <em>midrash</em> or <em>pesher,</em> or the Roman Catholic doctrine  of <em>sensus plenior </em>need be assumed,  but a consistent exegetical approach by both Hosea and Matthew. 
  </p>

<p><strong><em>Kingdom  of God</em></strong></p>
<p>Note frequent use of &ldquo;kingdom&rdquo;  or &ldquo;kingdom of God&rdquo; in the gospels</p>
<p><em>Kingdom of God and Old Testament prophetic hope (</em>see G.E. Ladd,<em> Presence of the Future)</em>
</p>
<p>The  crucial elements of Jesus&rsquo; teaching about the kingdom are rooted in OT:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>God is  King over <em>his people</em> (Exod. 15:18;  Num. 23:21; Is. 43:15; 2 Sam. 8)
    <ul>
      <li>At  Sinai (Ps. 68:7,8; Deut 33:2,5&hellip;)
      </li>
      <li>God&rsquo;s  rule includes his protection (Ps. 18:7&mdash;15)
      </li>
      <li>&ldquo;Day of  the Lord&rdquo; is God&rsquo;s visitation on the peoples when he establishes his rule (Joel  2,3; &hellip;)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>God is  the <em>earth&rsquo;s King</em> (2 Kings 19:15; Is.  6:5; Jer. 46:18), yet in a unique way, will become the <em>future</em> King of the earth (Is.  24:23; 33:22; 52:7; Zeph. 3:15; Zech. 14:9)
    <ul>
      <li>The  &ldquo;malkuth&rdquo; or rule of God is all over the OT (Ps. 145:11, 13; Ps. 103:19&hellip;)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>God&rsquo;s  rule is <em>David</em><em>&rsquo;s rule (</em>1 Chron. 28:5; 2 Chron. 9:8;  13:8; Ezek. 34:23,24&hellip;)
    <ul>
      <li>Davidic Branch is Branch of Yahweh (Is. 4:2; Jer.  23:5,6; 33:14&mdash;22; Zech. 3:8). See also  Ezek. 17:22&mdash;24 cf. John 7:41,42.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Kingdom in contemporary Jewish expectation</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Inter-testamental period developed apocalyptic outlook:
    <ul>
      <li>Future  and present are unrelated </li>
      <li>Present  is evil and age to come is a time of blessing for God&rsquo;s people and judgment for  his enemies</li>
      <li>Ethical  passivity: Rigorous individual faithfulness to the Law is only duty</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

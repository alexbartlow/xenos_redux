<p><strong>Overview:  Exodus 1&mdash;19 </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Exodus  opens with the Hebrews in bondage under a pharaoh who &ldquo;did not know  Joseph.&rdquo; It is the story of God  &ldquo;remembering his covenant&rdquo; and delivering his people from slavery through  Moses, his chosen leader. This section  of scripture is extraordinary in what it reveals about the person of God and  his plan for humanity: God the redeemer, his people, the redeemed. Exodus is a central biblical narrative,  retold and reworked in every generation of biblical revelation. </p>

The dialogue    shows a new humility in Moses, but not a mature trust in the Lord.</p>
      <p></p>

      <p>Moses&rsquo;    self-doubt.</p>

      <p>3:12. God&rsquo;s    sign to Moses provides poignant bookends to the narrative (19:17,18).</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>3:15. For    the third time (2:23&mdash;25, 3:6), we are reminded that the Lord is the God of    promise, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. How many times does the text say, &ldquo;I    will&rdquo;? The Lord is active, not some    abstract concept or natural force.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>3:15. YHWH    the &ldquo;memorial-name&rdquo; of God suggests deeper insight into his purpose&mdash;is it    this amazing event, the exodus, that is his &ldquo;signature act,&rdquo; his    &ldquo;memorial&rdquo;? At the end of the plagues,    the Passover is established as &ldquo;memorial, a permanent ordinance&rdquo; the    &ldquo;beginning of months for you.&rdquo; (12:2,14).    Clearly we&rsquo;ll need to explore this in the &ldquo;theology&rdquo; section of the    study.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>3:16&mdash;22. This section is really a summary of what    follows in the narrative through 12:36    (Egypt is plundered). It suggests that    neither the past nor the future surprise God, that he is the sovereign Lord    of history. </p></td>

  <li>Burning  bush on Mt. Horeb (3:1,2).
    <blockquote>
      <p>Meeting God in the mountain is not  uncommon in the OT. In cultural context,  the mountains were the dwelling places of the gods. In the OT, God transcends the earth, but  mountains are a common place for the human/divine connection: Eden (Ezek.  28:13,16, cf. Gen. 2:10&mdash;14), Horeb/Sainai (Exod. 3, 19, 34...), Jerusalem (2  Sam. 7). </p>

  <li>Angel  of the Lord (3:2,4).

      <p>See also 13:19; 23:20&mdash;23; 32:34. In context, the angel of the Lord and the  Lord are the same. </p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>

  <li>Holiness  of God (3:5). <em>qados, hasid.</em>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Related to &ldquo;fire,&rdquo; &ldquo;sacred,&rdquo; and  &ldquo;glory,&rdquo; holiness is the separateness and utter uniqueness of God from all  creation. In contrast to the &ldquo;holiness&rdquo; of  the gods of the ancient world (Exod. 15:11), Yahweh is holy in an ethical  sense. Holiness relates most closely  with God&rsquo;s <em>righteousness</em>, God dwells  in &ldquo;unapproachable light&rdquo; (1 Tm. 6:16).</p>
      <p>God&rsquo;s <em>justice</em> is necessary as a perfect moral Being: &ldquo;All have sinned and fallen short of the  glory of God&rdquo; (Rom. 3:23).</p>
      <p>God&rsquo;s righteousness, his essential  holiness, also relates to <em>mercy</em>. Salvation and is always undeserved, but  freely given (Isaiah 45:8; 46:13; 51:5). </p>
      <p>Moral monotheism vs. ancient near east  polytheism. Substantial implications  exist for the concept of morality and social justice. </p>
      <p>The purpose of man&rsquo;s  creation is conditioned by the general purpose of the universe. According to the <em>Enuma Elish</em>, the universe was created for the benefit of the  gods... Even Babylon was built for the gods... man&rsquo;s creation was conceived and  executed not as an end it itself or as a natural sequel to the formation of the  rest of the universe, but rather as an expedient to satisfy a group of  discontented gods. Man&rsquo;s purpose in life  was to be the serves of the gods... </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> Alexander  Heidel, <em>The Babylonian Genesis</em></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It is small wonder,  therefore, that all polytheisms tend to be religions of the <em>status quo</em>, and that none of them has  ever produced a thoroughgoing social revolution based upon a high concept of  social justice... In the Bible, however, a state of tension exists between God  and creation... A profound disharmony exists between the will of god and the  existing social order. </p>

  <li>God  is not impassible (3:7,9,16)
    <blockquote>
      <p>God is affected by his creation. He has &ldquo;seen the affliction of My people&rdquo;;  &ldquo;the cry of the sons of Israel has come to Me;&rdquo; &ldquo;I am indeed concerned about  you and what has been done to you in Egypt.&rdquo; </p>

    </blockquote>
  </li>

  <li>YHWH:  God&rsquo;s &ldquo;memorial name&rdquo; (3:14,15)
    <blockquote>
      <p>  Names in the Old Testament world  reveal something of the person (e.g.: Jacob).  While God is referred to by many names, his proper name is YHWH: I  AM. That God would bring attention to  this personal pronoun here as a &ldquo;memorial name&rdquo; is significant. It brings focus to the reader that this is a  decisive, signature action of God&mdash;that he will be known by his redeeming his  people from bondage! It is not that the  name Yahweh was unknown to God&rsquo;s people (Gen. 4:26), rather the character  imbedded in the name was yet to be realized (Gen. 17:1). Now the reader is about to learn who Yahweh  really is.

      <p>The utter humility of  sinners before a holy God (see Isaiah 6:3&mdash;5).  The expression &ldquo;fear of the Lord&rdquo; is used 124 times in the Old  Testament. It relates to &ldquo;amazement,&rdquo;  &ldquo;awe,&rdquo; and genuine &ldquo;fear.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Fear of the Lord guards  the heart (Hebrews 11:27; Isaiah 8:12&mdash;14).  Who you fear is who you serve.  Indeed, the fear of the Lord produces persuasion (2 Cor. 5:11). </p>
      <p>Fear of the Lord is the  basis for wisdom (Prov. 1:7). <em></em></p>

  <li>Total  inadequacy for the task <em></em>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The narrative section  3:11&mdash;4:17 focus on Moses&rsquo; objections to God&rsquo;s commission based on his complete  inadequacy for the task. God responds to  each of the four objections:</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>&ldquo;Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh?&rdquo; (3:11). God responds, &ldquo;I  will be with you&rdquo; and promises Moses a sign.</li>
      <li> By what authority?  Or in whose name am I going? (3:13).  God  responds by using his  memorial name. </li>
      <li>&ldquo;What if they don&rsquo;t believe me or listen to what I say?&rdquo;  (4:1). God  will use even a common stick to arrest their attention. </li>
      <li>&ldquo;I  have never been eloquent of speech&rdquo; (4:10).  God will provide Aaron. <em></em></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>God  will allow his people to be subject to the historical realities they face <em></em>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Receiving  the promise land (3:8,17) will come through direct confrontation with Pharaoh  (3:19,20).</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Consider how the narrative reflects or  advances key theological themes in the OT.</em><em></em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Advancing  the Abrahamic Covenant. 
    <blockquote>
      <p>We have seen that the  entire narrative is filled with reference to the Abrahamic Covenant. Fulfillment is coming!</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>

  <li>Slavery  and redemption: key biblical theme of salvation. This text is really crucial to the  inter-textual hermeneutic. <em></em>
    <blockquote>
      <p>13  times Isaiah alone refers to God as the <em>Redeemer</em>. The exodus from Egypt is the paradigm, or  model of redemption that will echo through Israel&rsquo;s history and overflow into  the New Testament. We have already seen  that exodus is a central <em>motif</em> in  biblical literature. <strong></strong></p>
    </blockquote>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Application</strong> (skin) of the  narrative</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>How the narrative instructs God&rsquo;s  people to be faithful to him.</em><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Biblical narrative relates both  to the original audience and to all of God&rsquo;s people throughout time (Deut. 6:4-9; Hebrews 11; Romans 15:4;  1 Corinthians 10:1&mdash;6) </p>
<ul>
  <li>What  actions, attitudes, or convictions are being called for by the author to his  original audience? (cognitive, relational, and active elements of  application&mdash;see Deut. 6:4&mdash;9). In  narrative, application is closely tied to the human drama&mdash;how are characters  presented? Should we be like them or  should we see in them a cautionary tale? </li>
  <li>How do  these attitudes, convictions, or actions relate to us?
    <ul>
      <li>So  in what ways might we relate to Moses in Exodus 3 and 4? The main point of the narrative is clear: God  has come to deliver his people from Egypt (3:7), but that plan includes  Moses. In what way can we relate to his  situation? In what way can we relate to  his reactions? In what way are we  instructed through Moses?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em>Assignment:</em></strong> Exodus 15:1&mdash;18 The Song of  Moses. This is a response in poetry and  song to the exodus. It highlights two  important dimensions of inductive study: <em>theology</em>&mdash;what  it says about God and his plan for humanity, and <em>application</em>&mdash;what is an appropriate response to God&rsquo;s  redemption. </p>
<p></p>
<p> 1.  Identify and define each of the characteristics of God.</p>
<p></p>
<p> 2.  In personal meditation on these characteristics, describe how two of  them   speak to your life today. How they challenge, clarify, or comfort  you. </p>

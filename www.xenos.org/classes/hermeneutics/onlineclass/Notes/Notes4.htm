<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Reflections on the <em>Song of Moses</em> (Exodus 15:1&mdash;18)</strong></p>
<p>About the  text:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The  Song of Moses comes immediately after the great deliverance from centuries of  hardship in Egypt. Having seen the power  of God to intervene in history, Israel finally &ldquo;feared the Lord and believed in  the Lord and in his servant Moses&rdquo; (14:31).  The Song of Moses is a tribute to Yahweh and an opportunity for the  people to join together with one voice in thanks to him. Even as we set our sights on the end of the  story of salvation, the Song of Moses is on the lips of God&rsquo;s people  (Rev.15:3,4). </p>
  <p>The  song reflects the <em>past deliverance</em> of  Israel from the pharaoh (1&mdash;13), then sets its sights on the <em>future victory</em> and <em>reign</em> of God in the promised land (14&mdash;19). In this sense, God&rsquo;s people are being called  to live by faith between two certainties: what God <em>has done</em> in the past and what God declares he <em>will do</em> in the future. </p>
</blockquote>
About God:
<blockquote>
  <p><em>&ldquo;The Lord is a warrior&rdquo; </em>(3 cf. Isaiah 47:4, &ldquo;Lord of Hosts  [armies]&rdquo;). God&rsquo;s victory over Pharaoh (1&mdash;10 cf. 14:14),  nature (8), other gods (11 cf. 12:12), and Israel&rsquo;s future enemies  (14&mdash;16a). Enemies past are vanquished by  his &ldquo;right hand&rdquo; (6,12); future enemies live in fear of his &ldquo;arm&rdquo; (16, cf.  Josh. 2:10; 5:1; 9:9). </p>
  <p><em>&ldquo;Who is like Yahweh?&rdquo;</em> (11 cf. Micah 7:18). His lovingkindness (12) is the basis for his  action, his leadership. Majestic in  holiness, or total uniqueness in a moral sense (11). When Moses asks God to reveal himself,  graciousness and kindness are central (Ex. 34:6,7). </p>
  <p><em>Redeemer </em>(13,16). Nothing is more central to the meaning of  Exodus than redemption. The exodus from Egypt and the &ldquo;eternal  memorial&rdquo; of Passover are remembered in ritual and throughout the scripture as  they find their fulfillment in Christ.  Note that God, not Israel, secures release from captivity. Israel is only witness to and beneficiary of  God&rsquo;s redemption. This is a picture of  grace. We have become God&rsquo;s possession,  purchased (16) by him. Israel is no  longer Pharaoh&rsquo;s slave, but God&rsquo;s son (4:22).</p>
  <p><em>&ldquo;The Lord shall reign forever and  ever&rdquo; </em>(18). Yahweh is Israel&rsquo;s King and Israel is his  inheritance (17 cf. Eph. 1:18). The  mountain of Yahweh&rsquo;s inheritance may be a prophetic allusion to Zion or in a  more generic sense of the imagery of the day, an expression of God&rsquo;s presence  with his people, often associated with mountains. Israel is the &ldquo;sanctuary of the Lord&rdquo; (17),  meaning that God will dwell among his people.  It&rsquo;s a picture of God&rsquo;s people thriving under their redeemer&rsquo;s rule and  his supernatural presence with them. </p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
Personal  Response: 
<blockquote>
  <p><em>True spirituality requires memory</em>.  &ldquo;Remember&rdquo; is used 200 times in the OT.  To remember is to see things for what they are, leading to victorious  acts of faith in God. Conversely, to  forget is to become foolish and lapse into sin and unbelief. Memory also produces gratitude, which in turn  orients believers to reality (note the contrast in Romans 1:21,28). This lesson is at the heart of the teaching  of wisdom in the Old Testament. See, for  instance, Psalm 78. </p>
  <p><em>&ldquo;My strength and salvation&rdquo;</em> (2).  Are God&rsquo;s power and mercy sufficient?  See also Romans 8:14&mdash;17, 31&mdash;39.  Where are we turning for strength?  How would we know if we were operating out of self-righteousness rather  than grace? </p>
  <p>There  is an <em>emotional dimension</em> that can&rsquo;t  be overlooked. The Song of Moses is a  song&mdash;to be sung together in a corporate act of gratitude and praise. Good news is to be met with an outpouring of  praise (Isaiah 54:1; Psalm 98:1&mdash;3). What  directs our life and passions? C.S.  Lewis has a helpful discussion in <em>Reflection  On The Psalms</em>. </p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Overview: The  Prophets</strong></p>
<p><em>Summarize the historical setting  including biographical information about the prophet. </em></p>
<p>The prophets spoke both to their  own historical situation and beyond it to the future. The turbulent and uncertain times of the  divided monarchy, Babylonian captivity and resettlement provide a backdrop of  existential and theological challenges to the people of God. Where is God?  Why are these things happening to a covenant people? Is God faithful to his promises? What will the future look like? Within this context, prophets speak forth the  word of God, challenging and comforting the people. And remarkably, within the biblical context  of antecedent theology, the prophets look to the future of God&rsquo;s program on  earth. </p>
<p>The first step in inductive study  is to orient the prophet&rsquo;s book in its historical environment. As you read, note any reference to the  prophet&rsquo;s place and family or origin. What  strata of society does the prophet come from?  What tribe? </p>
<p>Prophets also provide critical  information about when they received their messages from God in relation to the  ruling kings of Israel and Judah. For  instance, Amos 1:1</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  The words of Amos,  who was among the sheepherders from Tekoa, which he envisioned in visions  concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of  Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based  on this information, we can look to the narrative in Kings and Chronicles to  get a picture of what was happening during this time (for Amos see 2 Kings  13,14; 2 Chron. 22,26). A short summary  of the spiritual, moral, and political climate will help understand the context  for the prophetic messages within the book. </p>

<h4><em>Outline the book by  oracle/narrative, identifying significant  and recurring themes and structure. </em></h4>
<p><em>What  is an oracle?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>The main structural element of  book. Oracles are messages from God.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Prophetic books are carefully organized collections of a  prophet&rsquo;s oracles</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Chronology or theme are main criteria  for arrangement</li>
  <li>Oracles introduced by:
    <ul>
      <li> change in narrative context or subject:  people (who), place (where), time (when)</li>
      <li>Introduction formula
        <ul>
          <li>&ldquo;Thus says the Lord&hellip; &ldquo;, or &ldquo;Then the Lord said to me&hellip;&rdquo;, or &ldquo;The word of  the Lord came to me&hellip;&rdquo;; &ldquo;Hear the word of the Lord&hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Lord showed me&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
          <li>&ldquo;Hear&rdquo;, &ldquo;Woe&rdquo;&hellip; </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Illustration of structure: Amos</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Amos 1, 2:
    <ul>
      <li>8 times the expression &ldquo;for three transgressions and four, I will...&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Amos 3&mdash;5
    <ul>
      <li>Imperative to &ldquo;hear&rdquo; occurs as an  introduction to the sets of oracles (3:1; 4:1; 5:1)</li>
      <li> Repetition also relates to the  structure of the individual oracle:  
        <ul>
          <li>&ldquo;Yet you have not returned to Me&rdquo; 5  times in ch. 4, ending with &ldquo;prepare to meet your God&rdquo;</li>
          <li>&ldquo;Seek&hellip;that you may live&rdquo; in Amos 5</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Amos 6
    <ul>
      <li>&ldquo;Woe&rdquo; introduces the prophecy of ch. 6</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Amos 7&mdash;9 
    <ul>
      <li>A series of five visions with response  introduced by &ldquo;Thus the Lord God showed me&hellip;&rdquo; (7:1, 4, 7; 8:1; 9:1)</li>
    </ul>

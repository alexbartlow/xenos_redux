<p><em>Studies in extended  dialogue: John 6:26&mdash;58 </em></p>
<p><em>Context:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Feeding the  5,000&mdash;the same crowd follows Jesus to Capernaum (6:24). Because of this sign, the crowd concludes  that Jesus is a prophet, perhaps like Moses in the wilderness (6:14). In contrasting John with the synoptic gospels  it is clear that the disciples did not understand the true significance of the  sign (Mark 6:52). Luke 9:12-17 and  Matthew 14:13-21 provide no comment on the crowd&rsquo;s or disciples&rsquo; response, but  in John 6, the sign is followed by detailed explanation of its meaning.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>By this time in  Jesus&rsquo; ministry, strong opposition existed (Jn. 5:58), but the crowds continued  to follow him. This extended dialogue  polarizes the masses (6:60,61,66), and leads to Peter&rsquo;s confession of faith (6:68,69). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Setting:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Multitudes  follow Jesus to Capernaum after the feeding of the 5,000 (6:22&mdash;25)</li>
  <li>Jesus speaks in  the synagogue (6:59)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Structure:</em></p>
<p>Note that the dialogue is framed around Jesus&rsquo; answers  to six questions:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Vs. 25&mdash;27 &ldquo;When  did you get here?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Vs. 28&mdash;29 &ldquo;What  are the works of God?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Vs. 30&mdash;33 &ldquo;What  sign to you give us?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Vs. 34&mdash;40 &ldquo;Give  us this bread&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Vs. 41&mdash;51 &ldquo;Who  is this man Jesus?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Vs. 52&mdash;58 &ldquo;How  can he give us his flesh?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><u>#1: vs. 25&mdash;27 </u></p>
<p><u></u><em>Question</em>: &ldquo;When did you  get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Answer</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You do not seek  signs, but free food (Jesus is getting to their motives)</li>
  <li><em>Do not work for perishable food, but for food that endures to</em> <strong>eternal life (</strong>sets up the  contrast between earthly and heavenly, material and spiritual that runs through  the text)</li>
  <li><u>which</u> the Son of Man shall give you</li>
  <li><u>for</u> on him God has set his seal</li>
</ul>
<p><u></u><u>#2: vs. 28&mdash;29 </u></p>
<p><u></u><em>Question</em>: &ldquo;What are the  works of God?&rdquo; (following the comment about &ldquo;working for food&rdquo;)</p>
<p><em>Answer</em>: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The work of God  is to<strong> believe</strong> in him whom He has  sent</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><u>#3 vs. 30&mdash;33 </u></p>
<p><u></u><em>Question</em>: &ldquo;What sign do  you give?&rdquo; (why should we believe that you are from God?)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Our fathers ate  manna (Psalm 78:24)</li>
</ul>
<p><em></em><em>Answer</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>My Father, not  Moses, gave true bread out of heaven</li>
  <li><u>for</u> God&rsquo;s bread coming from heaven gives<strong> life</strong> to the world</li>
</ul>
<p><u></u><u>#4 vs. 34&mdash;40 </u></p>
<p><u></u><em>Question</em>: &ldquo;Give us this  bread&rdquo; (seeking a repeat of the earlier miracle and failing to understand the  symbolic meaning of the bread)</p>
<p><em></em><em>Answer</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>I am the bread of life</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>he who comes to  me will not hunger</li>
      <li>he who comes to  me will never thirst</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>But</u> you have seen me, and yet not<strong> believe</strong></li>
  <li>All that the  Father gives me shall come to me
    <ul>
      <li>I will not cast  out any who comes</li>
      <li><u>for</u> I have come from heaven to do God&rsquo;s will
        <ul>
          <li>this is God&rsquo;s  will, that none given to me are lost, but <strong>raised  up on the last day</strong></li>
          <li><u>for</u> this is God&rsquo;s will, 
            <ul>
              <li><u>that</u> everyone who beholds and <strong>believes</strong> the Son may have <strong>eternal life</strong> <u>and</u> I will <strong>raise him up on the last day</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><u>#5 vs. 41&mdash;51</u></p>
<p><u></u><em>Question</em>: &ldquo;How does Joseph&rsquo;s son say, &lsquo;I  come from heaven&rsquo;?&rdquo; (Jesus doesn&rsquo;t fit the messianic profile, being the son of Joseph from  Nazareth)</p>
<p><em></em><em>Answer</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No one can come  to me unless the Father draws him; and I will <strong>raise him up on the last day</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>It is written, &lsquo;they shall all be taught by God&rsquo; (Isaiah 54:13)</li>
      <li>All who learn from the Father come to me
        <ul>
          <li>No one has seen  the Father except the One from the Father</li>
          <li><u>Truly</u>, he who<strong> believes</strong> has <strong>eternal life</strong></li></ul></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>I am the bread  of life</em></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Your fathers  ate manna and died</li>
      <li>Eat this bread  from heaven and <strong>never die</strong></li>
      <li><strong><em>I am the living  bread from heaven</em></strong>
        <ul>
          <li>eat this bread  and <strong>live forever</strong></li>
          <li><u>for</u> the life of the world is my flesh</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><u>#6 vs. 52&mdash;58</u></p>
<p><em>Question</em>: &ldquo;How can he give us his flesh to eat?&rdquo; (the crowd isn&rsquo;t getting the  force of the analogy&mdash;they continue to seek bread for their stomachs and are  oblivious to the deep content of Jesus&rsquo; teaching)<em></em></p>
<p><em>Answer</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Truly</u>, unless you eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of Man you  have no life in yourselves.
    <ul>
      <li>He who eats my  flesh and drinks my blood has <strong>eternal  life</strong>, and I will <strong>raise him up on the  last day</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><u>for</u> my flesh is true food, and my blood true drink</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>He who eats my  flesh and drinks my blood abides in me and I in him</li>
  <li>As the Father  sent me, and I live because of the Father, he who eats me will also live  because of me.</li>
  <li>This is the  bread from heaven; 
    <ul>
      <li>not as the  fathers ate and died</li>
      <li>he who eats  this bread <strong>lives forever</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
Main Point:
Eat (<strong>believe</strong>) the bread of  life (<strong>Son</strong>) for <strong>eternal life</strong> (six times repeated, plus &ldquo;raise up on the last day&rdquo;  four times). Note the imperative in v.  27.
<p>Supporting points: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Each question  answered by Jesus describes the main point:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>25-27. The analogy established between physical and  spiritual food and  that Jesus has the unique authority from  God to give it.</li>
    <li>28,29. Believing, not working to receive the food  from heaven.</li>
    <li>30-33. God alone provides the manna from heaven for  the world to have.</li>
    <li>34-40. I AM the bread of life. Believe in the Son for eternal life.</li>
    <li>41-51. I AM the bread of life. Believe in me for eternal life.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><u>Content</u>:</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Use of the Old Testament. In what  sense(s) is the Old Testament being used?</em></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Manna. The crowd cites manna as a sign that God  authenticated Moses&rsquo; leadership, &ldquo;As it is written...&rdquo;, Psalm 78:24. Was this text cited by the crowd to incite  Jesus to another miracle to prove himself?  Perhaps. Certainly Psalm 78 is <em>ironic</em> in this context, as it refers to  manna primarily as a charge against the people for their unbelief (Ps. 78:22),  the very thing Jesus is also challenging. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>There is no  &ldquo;fulfillment&rdquo; language associated with the relationship of Jesus to the  manna. However, manna, or &ldquo;bread from  heaven&rdquo; is deeply symbolic of God&rsquo;s spiritual provision for his people:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He humbled you and let you be hungry, and fed you with manna which you  did not know, nor did your fathers know, that He might make you understand that  man does not live by bread alone, but by everything that proceeds out of the  mouth of the Lord.&rdquo; Deut. 8:3 (cf. Matt. 4:4)</p>
  <p>The analogy  between Jesus and manna is easy to see in this extended dialogue: &ldquo;if this, how much more that&rdquo; <em>a fortiori</em> formula.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>urgently needed  to live &ldquo;life,&rdquo;  &ldquo;eternal life&rdquo;  </li>
    <li>gift from God  coming down from heaven &ldquo;I am the  bread of life coming   down from heaven&rdquo;</li>
    <li>free and  abundant the  &ldquo;work&rdquo; is to &ldquo;believe&rdquo;</li>
    <li>accessible to  all &ldquo;he  who&rdquo;/&rdquo;everyone who&rdquo;   believes</li>
    <li>Citing Isaiah  54:13 (6:45). The blessing of the last  days envisioned by Isaiah, though generically referred to by Jesus as &ldquo;the  prophets&rdquo; (plural), indicates that Jesus is not focusing on specific  prediction&mdash;fulfillment, but in context, his unique authority to &ldquo;teach of God&rdquo;  given the unique Father/Son relationship Jesus has with God (6:45,46). He is not the son of Joseph (6:42), but far  more. &ldquo;It is written&rdquo; in this context  means, &ldquo;it applies.&rdquo; The last days are  present in Jesus&rsquo; pronouncement of the kingdom.</li>
  </ul>

<p>As I urged you on my departure for Macedonia, remain  on at Ephesus so that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange  doctrines, nor pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which give rise  to mere speculation rather than furthering the administration of God which is by  faith. But the goal of our instruction  is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. For some men, straying from these things,  have turned aside to fruitless discussion, wanting to be teachers of hte Law,  even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters  about which they make confident assertions. </p>

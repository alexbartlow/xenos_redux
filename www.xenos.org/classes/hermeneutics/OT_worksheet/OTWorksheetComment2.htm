<p>Main  themes, the theological emphasis of the narrative, are implied or sometimes explicitly given by the author. As you read, look for these hints to the main theme: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Theological markers: A promise, covenant  or blessing. E.g.: &quot;Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth&quot;  (Gen. 1:28); the Law of Moses (Ex. 20ff); the New Covenant (Jer. 31); The  Abrahamic promise (Gen. 12:1-3); the Davidic promise (2 Sam. 7).</li>
  <li>Summary statements: Statements that draw  conclusions about the events of the narrative. They provide an outline or  overview of the events. E.g.: Judges 2:6-23, which draws the conclusion that  the judges era was a dismal failure, illustrated by the cycle of apostasy among  leaders, and pointing the need for a monarch. </li>
  <li>Theological links: Links are statements  or events that serve as transitions from one marker to another. Links show that  these markers are not random ways that God works in human history, but are  instead &quot;linked&quot; together to form God's overall plan of salvation for  mankind. E.g.: God tells Joshua that He will be with him just as He was with  Moses (the Exodus <em>marker</em>). This comes  as God begins a new <em>marker</em>--the conquest of the land, which fulfills a promise made to Abraham.</li>
  <li>Repeated phrases: For example, the &ldquo;sins of  Jeroboam,&rdquo; used in II Kings 3:3; 10:29; 13:2; 13:11; 14:24; 15:9, 18,28; 17:21 </li>
</ul>

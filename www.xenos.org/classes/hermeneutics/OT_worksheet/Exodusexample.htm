<title>Exodus example</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>Identify and define  key theological terms or concepts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Burning  bush on Mt. Horeb (3:1-2): Meeting God in the mountain is not uncommon in  the OT. In cultural context, the mountains were the dwelling places of the  gods. In the OT, God transcends the  earth, but mountains are a common place for the human/divine connection: Eden  (Ezek. 28:13,16, cf. Gen. 2:10&mdash;14), Horeb/Sinai  (Exod. 3, 19, 34...), Jerusalem (2 Sam. 7).  God is also identified with fire.  &ldquo;The Lord is a consuming fire&rdquo; (Deut. 4:24; Heb. 12:29).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Angel  of the Lord (3:2, 4):  See also 13:19; 23:20-23; 32:34. In  context, the angel of the Lord and the Lord are the same.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Holiness  of God (3:5). <em>qados, hasid.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Related  to &ldquo;fire,&rdquo; &ldquo;sacred,&rdquo; and &ldquo;glory,&rdquo; holiness is the separateness and utter  uniqueness of God from all creation. In  contrast to the &ldquo;holiness&rdquo; of the gods of the ancient world (Exod. 15:11),  Yahweh is holy in an ethical sense.  Holiness relates most closely with God&rsquo;s righteousness, God dwells in &ldquo;unapproachable light&rdquo; (1 Tim. 6:16).</li>
      <li>God&rsquo;s justice is necessary as a perfect  moral Being: &ldquo;All have sinned and fallen  short of the glory of God&rdquo; (Rom. 3:23).</li>
      <li>God&rsquo;s  righteousness, his essential holiness, also relates to mercy. Salvation and is  always undeserved, but freely given (Isaiah 45:8; 46:13; 51:5). </li>
      <li>Moral  monotheism vs. ancient near east polytheism.  Substantial implications exist for the concept of morality and social  justice. 
        <ul>
          <li>The purpose of man&rsquo;s  creation is conditioned by the general purpose of the universe. According to the <em>Enuma</em><em> Elish</em>, the universe was created for the  benefit of the gods... Even Babylon was built for the gods... man&rsquo;s creation  was conceived and executed not as an end it itself or as a natural sequel to  the formation of the rest of the universe, but rather as an expedient to  satisfy a group of discontented gods.  Man&rsquo;s purpose in life was to be the serves of the gods... --Alexander Heidel, <em>The Babylonian Genesis</em></li>
          <li>It is small wonder,  therefore, that all polytheisms tend to be religions of the status quo, and that none of them has  ever produced a thoroughgoing social revolution based upon a high concept of  social justice... In the Bible, however, a state of tension exists between God  and creation... A profound disharmony exists between the will of god and the  existing social order. --G. Ernest  Wright, <em>The Old Testament Against Its  Environment</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>God  is not impassible (3:7, 9,16): God is affected by his  creation. He has &ldquo;seen the affliction of  My people&rdquo;; &ldquo;the cry of the sons of Israel has come to Me;&rdquo; &ldquo;I am indeed  concerned about you and what has been done to you in Egypt.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>God  of promise:
<ul>
      <li>Links  to the Abrahamic Covenant (3:6-8, 16,17). </li>
      <li>Promise  to Moses also (3:12), the &ldquo;sign&rdquo; that God is indeed with Moses.  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>YHWH:  God&rsquo;s &ldquo;memorial name&rdquo; (3:14,15): Names in the Old Testament world reveal something of the person  (e.g.: Jacob). While God is referred to  by many names, his proper name is YHWH: I AM.  That God would bring attention to this personal pronoun here as a  &ldquo;memorial name&rdquo; is significant. It  brings focus to the reader that this is a decisive, signature action of  God&mdash;that he will be known by his redeeming his people from bondage! It is not that the name Yahweh was unknown to  God&rsquo;s people (Gen. 4:26), rather the character imbedded in the name was yet to  be realized (Gen. 17:1). Now the reader  is about to learn who Yahweh really is.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>God&rsquo;s  sovereignty. God is the central actor in this  narrative. God has acted in the past, is  active in the present, and will act in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Describe what the narrative teaches  about the plan of salvation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Abrahamic  Covenant is in operation&mdash;blessing of nationhood and blessing to the world. What God promises, God will deliver. </li>
  <li>Yet  God chooses to effect his plan in history through people. Moses is called and commissioned by God for  his appointed task. He has freedom. He makes mistakes. He objects.  Yet, God will use this imperfect vessel for his purpose. </li>
</ul>
<p>Describe what the narrative teaches  about the human condition: </p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Fear  of the Lord&rdquo; (3:6). 
    <ul>
      <li>The  utter humility of sinners before a holy God (see Isaiah 6:3&mdash;5). The expression &ldquo;fear of the Lord&rdquo; is used 124  times in the Old Testament. It relates  to &ldquo;amazement,&rdquo; &ldquo;awe,&rdquo; and genuine &ldquo;fear.&rdquo; </li>
      <li>Fear  of the Lord guards the heart (Hebrews 11:27; Isaiah 8:12&mdash;14). Who you fear is who you serve. Indeed, the fear of the Lord produces  persuasion (2 Cor. 5:11). </li>
      <li>Fear  of the Lord is the basis for wisdom (Prov. 1:7). </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Total  inadequacy for the task: The narrative section 3:11&mdash;4:17 focus on Moses&rsquo;  objections to God&rsquo;s commission based on his complete inadequacy for the  task. God responds to each of the four  objections:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>&ldquo;Who  am I that I should go to Pharaoh?&rdquo; (3:11). God responds, &ldquo;I will be with you&rdquo;  and promises Moses a sign.</li>
    <li>By  what authority? Or in whose name am I  going? (3:13). God responds by using his  memorial name. </li>
    <li>&ldquo;What  if they don&rsquo;t believe me or listen to what I say?&rdquo; (4:1). God will use even a common stick to arrest  their attention. </li>
    <li>&ldquo;I  have never been eloquent of speech&rdquo; (4:10).  God will provide Aaron. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>God  will allow his people to be subject to the historical realities they face: Receiving  the promise land (3:8,17) will come through direct confrontation with Pharaoh  (3:19,20).</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider how the narrative reflects or  advances key theological themes in the OT:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advancing  the Abrahamic Covenant: We have seen that the entire  narrative is filled with reference to the Abrahamic  Covenant. Fulfillment is coming!</li>
  <li>Slavery  and redemption: key biblical theme of salvation. This text is really crucial to the inter-textual  hermeneutic. 
    <ul>
      <li>13  times Isaiah alone refers to God as the Redeemer. The exodus from Egypt is the paradigm, or  model of redemption that will echo through Israel&rsquo;s history and overflow into  the New Testament. We have already seen  that exodus is a central motif in  biblical literature. <strong></strong></li>

<p> How does  the plot of the narrative move forward? Look at the action described and the dialogue that is presented.&nbsp; Almost all Old  Testament narratives follow the pattern of a circumstance being introduced--perhaps a problem--then  unfolding through a series of scenes, culminating in a climax  or crisis, and then reaching resolution, e.g., the flood narrative (Genesis  6-9), Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac (Genesis 22), and Jacob and Esau (Genesis  32-33).</p>
<p>As you look at the  development of the plot and the dialogue, notice the narrator's description of  how the events and dialogue shape the  character's development. Describe what we&rsquo;re told of the inner life,  motivations, relative virtue, spiritual sensitivity, and relationship of the  characters to the main point of the narrative.&nbsp;  Is the reader to be drawn to or repulsed by the characters?&nbsp; How have the key characters been changed  through the narrative? (see Gen. 32,  33).</p>

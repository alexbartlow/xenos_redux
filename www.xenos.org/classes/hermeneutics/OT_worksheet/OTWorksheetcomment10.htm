<p>What  do we learn about the author's point of view and perspective of the characters  and the situation, based on his narration--the way he tells the story?&nbsp;<a href="/personal/jim.htm" target="_blank">Jim Leffel</a> with Xenos Christian Fellowship <a href="OT_worksheet/OTaudio/OT%20Narration.mp3" title="Old Testament Narration with Xenos Pastor Jim Leffel" class="popup audio">talks  about the value of observing how the story is told</a>:<img src="graphics/audio.png" width="16" height="16" alt="audio" /></p>
<p>As you study the narration, note the author's choice of space and tempo and editorial  insertions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Space and  tempo refers to the author's emphasis on certain elements of the story,  based on the amount of attention devoted to them in the narrative. The more  &quot;time&quot; devoted to a particular aspect or event in a narrative, the  more important it likely is to the author's overall point. Through this he is  drawing the reader&rsquo;s attention to what is important.&nbsp; Note for instance in the creation narrative  of Genesis 1 that the creative days leading to the creation of man move very  quickly, but then the pace slows as the uniqueness of man is carefully  described: the crown of creation.&nbsp; So  interpreters need to pay close attention to what is being emphasized through  narrative slowing and events or dialogue expanding.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Editorial insertions refers to the way the author &quot;frames&quot;  the story through statements to the reader. Look for meaningful introductions  (see Genesis 1:1), meaningful conclusions or summaries (see Genesis 2:3), and  statements that are clarifications, evaluations, or explanations (Genesis 6:6;  1 Samuel 21:6; Exodus 1:8).
  </li>

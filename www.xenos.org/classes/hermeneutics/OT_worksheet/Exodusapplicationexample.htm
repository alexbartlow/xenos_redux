<p style="text-align:center;">Reflections on the <em>Song of Moses</em></p>
<p>About the  text<strong>:</strong></p>
<p>The  Song of Moses comes immediately after the great deliverance from centuries of  hardship in Egypt. Having seen the power  of God to intervene in history, Israel finally &ldquo;feared the Lord and believed in  the Lord and in his servant Moses&rdquo; (14:31).  The Song of Moses is a tribute to Yahweh and an opportunity for the  people to join together with one voice in thanks to him. Even as we set our sights on the end of the  story of salvation, the Song of Moses is on the lips of God&rsquo;s people (Rev.15:3,  4).</p>
<p>The  song reflects the <em>past deliverance</em> of  Israel from the pharaoh (1-13), then sets its sights on the <em>future victory</em> and <em>reign</em> of God in the promised land (14-19). In this sense, God&rsquo;s  people are being called to live by faith between two certainties: what God <em>has done</em> in the past and what God  declares he <em>will do</em> in the  future.</p>
<p>About God:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>&ldquo;The Lord is a warrior&rdquo; </em>(3 cf. Isaiah 47:4, &ldquo;Lord of Hosts  [armies]&rdquo;). God&rsquo;s victory over Pharaoh (1-10 cf. 14:14),  nature (8), other gods (11 cf. 12:12), and Israel&rsquo;s future enemies (14-16a). Enemies past are vanquished by his &ldquo;right  hand&rdquo; (6,12); future enemies live in fear of his &ldquo;arm&rdquo; (16, cf. Josh. 2:10;  5:1; 9:9).</li>
  <li><em>&ldquo;Who is like Yahweh?&rdquo;</em> (11 cf. Micah 7:18). His loving-kindness  (12) is the basis for his action, his leadership. Majestic in holiness, or total uniqueness in  a moral sense (11). When Moses asks God  to reveal himself, graciousness and kindness are central (Ex. 34:6, 7).</li>
  <li><em>Redeemer </em>(13, 16). Nothing is more central to the meaning of  Exodus than redemption. The exodus from Egypt and the &ldquo;eternal  memorial&rdquo; of Passover are remembered in ritual and throughout the scripture as  they find their fulfillment in Christ.  Note that God, not Israel, secures release from captivity. Israel is only witness to and beneficiary of  God&rsquo;s redemption. This is a picture of  grace. We have become God&rsquo;s possession,  purchased (16) by him. Israel is no  longer Pharaoh&rsquo;s slave, but God&rsquo;s son (4:22).</li>
  <li><em>&ldquo;The Lord shall reign forever and  ever&rdquo; </em>(18). Yahweh is Israel&rsquo;s King and Israel is his  inheritance (17 cf. Eph. 1:18). The  mountain of Yahweh&rsquo;s inheritance may be a prophetic allusion to Zion or in a  more generic sense of the imagery of the day, an expression of God&rsquo;s presence  with his people, often associated with mountains. Israel is the &ldquo;sanctuary of the Lord&rdquo; (17),  meaning that God will dwell among his people.  It&rsquo;s a picture of God&rsquo;s people thriving under their redeemer&rsquo;s rule and  his supernatural presence with them. </li>
</ul>
<p>Personal  Response (application):</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>True spirituality requires memory</em>.  &ldquo;Remember&rdquo; is used 200 times in the OT.  To remember is to see things for what they are, leading to victorious  acts of faith in God. Conversely, to  forget is to become foolish and lapse into sin and unbelief. Memory also produces gratitude, which in turn  orients believers to reality (note the contrast in Romans 1:21, 28). This lesson is at the heart of the teaching  of wisdom in the Old Testament. See, for  instance, Psalm 78.</li>
  <li><em>&ldquo;My strength and salvation&rdquo;</em> (2).  Are God&rsquo;s power and mercy sufficient?  See also Romans 8:14-17, 31-39.  Where are we turning for strength?  How would we know if we were operating out of self-righteousness rather  than grace?</li>
  <li>There  is an <em>emotional dimension</em> that can&rsquo;t  be overlooked. The Song of Moses is a  song&mdash;to be sung together in a corporate act of gratitude and praise. Good news is to be met with an outpouring of  praise (Isaiah 54:1; Psalm 98:1-3). What  directs our life and passions? C.S.  Lewis has a helpful discussion in <em>Reflection  On The Psalms</em>. </li>

<p>At this point we want to relate each scene to the narrative as a whole. What role does this scene play in the unfolding narrative? To answer that question we must identify the main point of the entire story. </p>
<p>Often the narrative's  main point can be found in its closing verses--the plot's resolution. Before drawing a conclusion about the overall main point, make sure you consider each scene--is that  main point is connected to your conclusions about these individual scenes?&nbsp; The more diligence taken with this step, the more sound your 
interpretation will be.</p>
<p>Below are commonly used literary devices Old Testament authors used to draw their readers' focus onto the main point of the narrative.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Summary statements:
<ul>
      <li>Genesis 1:1 &ldquo;In the beginning God created the  heavens and the earth&rdquo; summarizes&mdash;and provides the main point&mdash;of the scene  covered in Genesis 1:1-2:3</li>
      <li>Ex. 7:2-5 serves as an outline for the general  flow of the plagues that follow
        <ul>
          <li>vs.  2: &quot;Let Israel go&quot;</li>
          <li>vs.  3: &quot;Pharaoh's hard heart&quot;</li>
          <li>vs.  3, 4: &quot;God will multiply signs and wonders...&quot;</li>
          <li>vs.  5: &quot;...<em>so that</em> the Egyptians  will know that Yahweh is the Lord&quot;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Repetitions: Repetitions are usually purposeful  and might take the form of:
    <ul>
      <li>Formulas: E. g.: 1 &amp; 2 Kings--king is  evaluated as to whether they did &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;good&quot; in the  eyes of the Lord; </li>
      <li>Words: &ldquo;Give&rdquo; in Joshua 1</li>
      <li>Events that are repeated with different people  and contexts, but with the same point or meaning--e.g. Joshua and Moses or  Elijah and Elisha (I Kings 17 and II Kings 4)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>God speaks: When God breaks into the  narrative&mdash;either directly or through the words of a prophet&mdash;it is usually a  vital statement of purpose. See I Sam. 13:13-14 and 15:22, 23</li>
  <li>Promise or covenant<em>:</em> A &ldquo;marker&rdquo; or &ldquo;link&rdquo;, especially when  repeated. For an explanation of markers and links, see <a href="OT_worksheet/OTWorksheetIntro.htm" title="Introduction to Studying Old Testament Narrative" class="popup">Introduction to Studying Old Testament Narrative</a></li>
  <li>Context: E.g. I Samuel 1:1-2:11 The length of  the narrative about Hannah indicates importance. Her character in turn  introduces Samuel, significant to the development of Old Testament salvation  history.</li>
  <li>Decisive or symbolic actions. &nbsp;For example:
    <ul>
      <li>Judges 14-16: Samson&rsquo;s dramatic destruction of  the Canaanite temple</li>
      <li>Is. 20:1-4: Isaiah's shame</li>
      <li>Jer. 18:1-12: Jeremiah's lump of clay</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Irony: E. g.&nbsp;  Judah in Gen. 37&mdash;the deceiver is deceived</li>
  <li>&quot;Moment of realization&quot;: E. g.  Joseph&rsquo;s announcement in Gen. 45:7, 8</li>
</ul>

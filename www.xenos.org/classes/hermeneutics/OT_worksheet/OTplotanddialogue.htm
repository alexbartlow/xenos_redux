<p><strong>Scene #1: 1:1-2</strong> </p>
<p>Author's point of view in narration: &quot;Nineveh         is a great city, but wicked&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Scene #2: 1:3-16 </strong></p>
<p>Author's point of view in narration: </p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;But&rdquo;         (1:3) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;fleeing         from the presence of the Lord&rdquo; (1:3, 10) </li>
  <li>downward         direction (1:3, 5) </li>
</ul>
<p>Action:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jonah    moves directly <em>away</em> from his    calling, into self-imposed isolation in the bottom of the ship </li>
  <li>Sailors become    frightened, cast lots, find Jonah, confront Jonah, throw Jonah overboard; the    storm ends; offer sacrifices to Jonah&rsquo;s God </li>
</ul>
<p>Dialogue<em>:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;How can you sleep?&mdash;You must pray to your god, maybe he&rsquo;ll hear    us.&quot; </li>
  <li>&quot;I am a    Hebrew, I fear the Lord of heaven who made the sea and dry land&quot; </li>
  <li>&quot;How could you do this?&quot;
  </li>
  <li>&quot;You must    toss me into the sea&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scene #3: 3: 1:17&mdash;2:9 </strong></p>
<p>Author's point of view in narration: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Jonah&rsquo;s         descent is complete (1:17;2:6) </li>
  <li>A poetic prayer reflects a change in perspective </li>
</ul>
<p>Action:</p>
<ul>
  <li>God    appoints a fish to save Jonah&mdash;but he will fall to the depths for a while    first </li>
  <li>Jonah    finally prays&mdash;for himself</li>
</ul>
<p>Dialogue: Jonah&rsquo;s    prayer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A plea: &ldquo;I called out of my distress&rdquo;</li>
  <li>A result: &ldquo;You brought up my life from the pit&rdquo;</li>
  <li>A response: thanksgiving to God, whom Jonah remembered</li>
  <li>Conclusion: Salvation is from the Lord </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scene #4: 2:10&mdash;3:9</strong></p>
<p>Author's point of view in narration: a         bit of ironic contrast between Jonah&rsquo;s proclamation of judgment, without         a call to repent, and the repentance of Nineveh </p>
<p>Action:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jonah heeds God&rsquo;s second &ldquo;word&rdquo; and goes to Nineveh </li>
  <li>Jonah preaches    while walking the wall of the city </li>
  <li>The people    and the king believe and repent, calling out to the Lord for mercy</li>
</ul>
<p>Dialogue:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Interestingly,    there is no dialogue, only Jonah preaching and the people responding. </li>
  <li>Nineveh is    to be overthrown in forty days </li>
  <li>King&rsquo;s decree: No eating or drinking; each are to repent    of their wickedness </li>
  <li>King&rsquo;s plea: &ldquo;Who knows, God may turn and relent and    withdraw his anger and we may not perish&rdquo; </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Scene #5: 3:10&mdash;4:11 </strong></p>
<p>Author's point of view in narration: this is    where the real climax and resolution of the story is&mdash;what it&rsquo;s all been    leading up to</p>
<p>Action:</p>
<ul>
  <li>God    relents for Nineveh </li>
  <li>Jonah is    angry with God, wishing to die </li>
  <li>Jonah    builds a shelter from the sun at a place where he can see the city&mdash;will it be    destroyed? </li>
  <li>God    provides, then destroys Jonah&rsquo;s source of shade </li>
  <li>God    rebukes Jonah</li>
</ul>
<p>Dialogue:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;I fled to Tarshish knowing you are slow to anger, abundant in    loving kindness, relenting concerning calamity&rdquo; </li>
  <li>&quot;Now take    my life&quot; </li>
  &quot;God confronts, &ldquo;Do you have reason to be angry?&rdquo;&mdash;first    about the city, then the plant 
  <li>&quot;Jonah    twice says he is angry even to death&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;God concludes: You had compassion on the plant that came    and went, but not for the great city of 120,000 lost people&quot;</li>
</ul>

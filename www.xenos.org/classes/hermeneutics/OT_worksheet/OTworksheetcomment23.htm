<p>Are  there clear references or allusions to other Biblical passages? Does that relate  to the meaning of the narrative? As you consider this narrative in relation to the rest of the Old Testament (and New Testament) how does it add to the Biblical teaching of God, humanity, and salvation? Are there terms or words that are part of a broader vocabulary relating to theology? For instance, does the narrative relate God's promises to Israel? Does the narrative expand your understanding of God's plan to &quot;bless&quot; the nations through Abraham (Gen. 12:3)?</p>
<p>Is the narrative used in subsequent texts, and  if so, how? E. g., after events of Ex. 17-- God providing water through the  rock--there are subsequent references to this imagery, including Deut. 32  (Moses describes God Himself as the provision) and in the New Testament where  Jesus is described as the source of living water (John 4), the rock on which to  build (Mt. 7), etc. From this we see that God--Jesus--is not only the provider,  but is the very provision Himself. </p>

<p>What does the narrative teach about  God&rsquo;s program on earth? How does it define or advance our understanding of  God's plan to rescue mankind?</p>
Look for:
<ul>
  <li>References or allusions to blessings, promises,  or covenants that sustain or advance God's plan of salvation</li>
  <li>Contrasts between God and the deities and  religious practices of Israel's neighbors</li>
  <li>Signs that the narrative is  an example of common salvation themes--redemption, forgiveness, reconciliation,  etc. What terms are used to describe God's plan in the world?</li>
</ul>

<p>Often the narrative's  main point can be found in its closing verses--the plot's resolution. Before drawing a conclusion about the overall main point, make sure you consider each scene--is that  main point is connected to your conclusions about these individual scenes?&nbsp; The more diligence taken with this step, the more sound your 
interpretation will be.</p>

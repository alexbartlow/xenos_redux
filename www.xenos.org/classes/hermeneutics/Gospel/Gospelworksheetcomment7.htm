<p>Describe  each person in the scene, noting characteristics that the narrator identifies.  Where are they from? Are they friend or foe? Are they portrayed as a positive  example or a cautionary example? The more you understand about the characters,  the more vivid your understanding of the scene will be. </p>
<p>Note: God can be a character in the passage as well, so note how He is   characterized.</p>

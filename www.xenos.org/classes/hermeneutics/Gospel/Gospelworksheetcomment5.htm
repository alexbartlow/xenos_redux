<p>Note  the events and themes of the passages that come before and after the one you are studying, and think about how they might   relate to the passages you are studying. This gives you clues about your  passage&rsquo;s purpose.

<p>The Gospels often continue Jesus' teaching by showing it in action or, conversely, by following up Jesus' action with clarifying teaching. For example, Matthew concludes the Sermon on the Mount (Matt. 5-7) with the observation &quot;He was teaching them as one having authority&quot; Then we see in Matthew 8 and 9 that Jesus demonstrates his authority in a series of miracles. An example of Jesus' actions setting up his teaching can be found in John 6, the feeding of the 5000. Jesus performs the miracle, then declares, &quot;I am the bread of life&quot; (John 6:35).</p>

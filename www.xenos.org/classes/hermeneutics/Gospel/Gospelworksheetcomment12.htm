<p>It  is important to make sure each scene is  connected to this main  point.&nbsp; The more diligence taken with  this step, the more sound your interpretation will be. What is the evidence supporting your conclusion about the main point? How is   the main point illustrated? Note Old Testament  citations and illustrations, miracles that serve as signs, and connective words  such as &quot;because,&quot; &quot;for,&quot; etc.

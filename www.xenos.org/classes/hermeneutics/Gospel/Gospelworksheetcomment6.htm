<p>Note if  the author provides a introductory or explanatory statement within the passage  that helps set up or summarize the passage. </p>
<p>For example the Pharisees' question in Matthew 15:2, &quot;Why do Jesus' disciples violate traditions by eating with ritually unwashed hands?&quot; sets up Matthew 15:1-20.</p>
<p>These editorial devices of the narrator help readers understand the dramatic moments and, therefore, the significance of Jesus' teaching or actions. For example, John 7:1 shows the great hostility toward Christ in Judea. So when Jesus arrives later in Judea, conflict is inevitable.</p>

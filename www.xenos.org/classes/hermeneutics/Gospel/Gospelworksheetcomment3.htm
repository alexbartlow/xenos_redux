<p>The  best way to spot the main themes is to look for repeated terms, repeated  events, and relative space devoted.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Repeated  terms:&nbsp; Look for words that are  technical or theological in nature such as &ldquo;kingdom of God,&rdquo; &ldquo;fulfill,&rdquo;  &ldquo;believe,&rdquo; &ldquo;life,&rdquo; etc. By compiling a list of these words and summarizing  them, you&rsquo;ll see an emphasis emerge. It is also helpful to use a concordance to  see how one author emphasizes a particular term more than another author. For  example, John&rsquo;s use of &ldquo;believe&rdquo; (71 occurrences, compared to only 32 in the 3  other Gospels combined); and &ldquo;life&rdquo; (62 occurrences)</li>
  <li>Repeated  events: For example, the repeated inclusion of controversies or miracles.</li>
  <li>Relative space devoted: How much of the author&rsquo;s  work is devoted to particular times? Mark and John both spend a considerable  part of their gospels on Jesus&rsquo; final week.</li>
</ul>

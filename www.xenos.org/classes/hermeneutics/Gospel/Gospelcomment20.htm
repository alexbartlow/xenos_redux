</table>
<p>Main point:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jesus is the  messiah, Son of David&mdash;all elements of the scene indicate this</li>
</ul>
<p>Supporting points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Entry into  Jerusalem fulfills Zech. 9:9; &ldquo;Branch of Yahweh&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Multitude  recognize Jesus as &ldquo;Son of David&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Theology</p>
<p>For the first time in his public ministry, Jesus intentionally sets himself forth as the  awaited messiah, the &ldquo;Son of David&rdquo;.  Yet, this fulfillment has much irony which was almost certainly lost on  the original participants in this event.  Jesus directly fulfills Zechariah 9:9, anticipating the messiah coming  as king, bringing salvation to Jerusalem, and mounted humbly on a colt. Laying branches before the messiah symbolically  connects the hope of messiah with the &ldquo;Branch of David&rdquo; (Jer. 23:5; Is.  11:1,2,10; Zech. 3:8-10). The crowd  cites Psalm 118:25, 26. &ldquo;Hosanna&rdquo; means  &ldquo;Lord save us&rdquo; (Ps. 118:25), followed by &ldquo;Blessed is the one who comes in the  name of the Lord.&rdquo; The whole text of Ps.  118:22-28 seems uniquely relevant and prophetic. It is a hymn sung at one of the key festivals  of the Jews, probably Passover&mdash;which in context clearly has symbolic  significance. So Jesus, the &ldquo;rejected  cornerstone&rdquo; is to be the sacrifice bound to the altar. </p>

        <li>Followed by    the symbolic cursing of the fig tree</li>
        <li>His authority    will be challenged based, in part, on this event (21:23ff.)</li>

      <ul>
        <li>In Jerusalem    at the temple</li>

        <li>Rather than    &ldquo;anointing the holy place,&rdquo; Jesus creates a scandal by in essence denouncing    it.</li>
    </ul></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Main point:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cleansing the  temple for its true purpose, as a confrontation with the religious officials  that misrepresent its purpose</li>
</ul>
<p>Supporting points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cleansing the  temple is in keeping with the tradition of prophetic denunciation such as in  Isaiah&rsquo;s day (v.13 cf. Jeremiah 7:11)</li>
  <li>More signs from  Jesus in healing the blind and lame (v.14)</li>
  <li>Child&rsquo;s faith  again affirmed (v.15,16, cf. Psalm 8:2)</li>
</ul>
<p>Theology:</p>
<p>When the messiah comes, he is to anoint the temple  (Dan. 9:24 and related passages). But in  this scene, Jesus does not consecrate the temple, but confronts it for its  hypocrisy. This event is another  instance of confronting the religious who are far from the kingdom. The discussion in vs. 23-27 clearly draw  importance on the issue of authority&mdash;an issue that pervades Jesus&rsquo;  ministry. The children&rsquo;s faith and the  signs performed, again, demonstrate the truth of Jesus&rsquo; witness and the emptiness  of Jewish formalistic religion.</p>

  </tr>
</table>
<p>Main point:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jesus&rsquo;  disciples called to a true, effective faith (v.22)</li>
</ul>
<p>Supporting points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Contrast of  Israel&rsquo;s failed faith&mdash;the symbolic imagery of the fig tree</li>
  <li>Israel (the fig  tree) is condemned to fruitlessness</li>
</ul>
<p>Theology:</p>
<p>Fig tree as Israel (in context of previous scene; also Hosea 9:10;  Jeremiah 8:13 use the same imagery in relation to Israel, and the latter, in  relation to God&rsquo;s judgment of the nation).  Israel was to bear the fruit of being God&rsquo;s unique covenant people. They failed to obey God&rsquo;s law and did not  live as a witness of God to the watching world.  So Jesus pronounces judgment on Israel and shifts his attention to his  disciples, who will carry on the work of the kingdom. Effect of believing  prayer rooted in true belief, not ritual. </p>

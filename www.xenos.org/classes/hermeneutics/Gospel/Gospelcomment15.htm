<p>What does the passage teach about God&rsquo;s program on earth? How does the passage define or advance our understanding of God's plan to rescue mankind?
</p>
<p>Ask, &quot;in what way has the Kingdom of God come?&quot; Almost every chapter describes the &quot;life&quot; Jesus offers. What does that life involve? And how is salvation tied directly to the Old Testament and to the sacrificial system?</p>

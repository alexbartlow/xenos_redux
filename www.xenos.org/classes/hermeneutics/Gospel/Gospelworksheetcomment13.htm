<p>Two  helpful books on this are Craig Keener&rsquo;s <em>IVP Bible Background Commentary</em> and Robert Gundry&rsquo;s <em>Survey of the New Testament</em>.</p>
<p> Such  understanding of the historical and cultural context will help your  interpretation for a couple of reasons specific to the Gospel writings:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jesus' actions were often intended to teach  truth to his audience. To determine that truth, it&rsquo;s important to understand  the backdrop of Judaism against which Jesus did these actions. Notice where,  when, and for whom the action in a particular passage is performed. Ask  yourself, &ldquo;What is the significance of this demonstration, in this particular  context, to Jesus&rsquo; original audience?</li>
  <li>Notice the way people  around Jesus react to his teachings. How did their cultural context feed an  appropriate or inappropriate response to Jesus and his teachings? Since Jesus  was likely teaching and acting in a way that would elicit these responses,  these reactions give us good insight into the truth Jesus is conveying.</li>
</ul>

<p>What does the passage teach about Christ, God, and the Holy Spirit? What do we learn about their nature and relationship?</p>
<p>Gospel writers include substantial Christology in what they record of Jesus' teachings and actions. Be sure to identify in the text who Jesus is and what he offers his audience. Also, Jesus calls God his Father and calls upon his disciples to address God as Father too (Matt. 6:9).</p>

What does the passage teach about the sacrifices and  benefits of a  <em>life of discipleship</em>? One of the purposes of the Gospels is to teach the early church about what it means and looks like to follow Christ. Pay close attention to Jesus' instructions about following him, what it means to &quot;believe,&quot; and the examples he sets for his disciples.

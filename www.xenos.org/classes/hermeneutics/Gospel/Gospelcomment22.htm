<h3><strong></strong>Structure studies in Matthew 15</h3>
<h4>Matthew 15:21-28 The Syrophoenician  woman</h4>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: Why is this passage  here?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Preceding  narrative: confrontation with Pharisees over &ldquo;defilement&rdquo; </li>
  <li>Following  narrative: summary of healings, then 4000 fed</li>
  <li>Narrative  directed both to the pagan woman (in a pagan setting) and to the disciples</li>
  <li>Mt.  15:21&mdash;28 extends the argument of the last interaction&mdash;that faith from the  heart, not ritual cleansing from defilement, is what God seeks</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Outline of narrative structure</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First  scene: request of woman to Jesus (15:21-22)&mdash;sets up the drama
    <ul>
      <li>Who? Where?  When?</li>
      <li>Note  the irony&mdash;Jesus leaves Israel after engaging Jerusalem&rsquo;s religious elite over  the nature of ritual cleanness, to pagan land.  The Canaanite woman, unlike either the disciples or the religious  authorities, recognizes Jesus&rsquo; true identity as &ldquo;Son of David&rdquo; (see also 9:27;  12:23&mdash;two prior uses of &ldquo;Son of David&rdquo;, both on lips of the unclean).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Second  scene: exchange with disciples (15:23-24)&mdash;establishes the significance of the  deliverance.
    <ul>
      <li>Jesus&rsquo;  silence is met by the disciples&rsquo; request to send her away.</li>
      <li>Jesus&rsquo;  response is significant: &ldquo;I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.&rdquo;
        <ul>
          <li>The Son  of David is Israel&rsquo;s messiah in a unique way (see Jn. 4:22&mdash;26). But at the same  time, Jesus has healed gentiles (8:5&mdash;13). </li>
          <li>These  points contribute to the dramatic exchange between the woman and Jesus.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Third  scene: exchange with the woman (15:25-28)&mdash;the sufficiency of faith in God&rsquo;s  mercy.
    <ul>
      <li>To the  woman&rsquo;s repeated plea Jesus says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not good to throw the children&rsquo;s bread  to the dogs.&rdquo; I.e.&mdash;blessings go to Israel, not gentiles.</li>
      <li>Woman  does not contradict Jesus, but extends the saying to include the needs of her  daughter&mdash;a true act of reverent faith.</li>
      <li>Jesus,  seeing her faith, grants her the request.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Structure summary</strong>: Context:  challenge of internal vs. external cleanliness </p>
<ul>
  <li>Supporting  Point #1: Ironic identification by &ldquo;unclean&rdquo; woman that Jesus is &ldquo;Son of David&rdquo;
  </li>
  <li>Supporting  Point #2: Messiah&rsquo;s mission centers on the lost of  Israel
  </li>
  <li>Supporting  Point #3: Woman pleas for inclusion in blessings of God to Israel </li>
  <li>  Main  Point: God honors the greatness of woman&rsquo;s faith (both persistence and  content)&mdash;she is a strong antithesis to the rabbis&rsquo; tradition-based religion  centering on purity and defilement 
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Matthew 15:1-20 </h4>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: Why is this passage  here? </p>
<ul>
  <li>Preceding  passage: walking on the water&mdash;a challenge to Peter&rsquo;s faith (compare with 9:27  where the emphasis is on Jesus&rsquo; unique authority)
  </li>
  <li>Following  passage: delivering the Syrophoenician woman&rsquo;s  daughter and other healings&mdash;here is a woman who is certainly unclean
    Teaching  is directed first to the Pharisees themselves (denunciation); then to the  multitude; finally, to the disciples.  Note that this is the only passage in this section in which all three  audiences are involved.
  </li>
  <li>Mt.  15:1-20 reveals the heart of the conflict in Jesus&rsquo; ministry: hypocritical  elevation of the authority of tradition (preoccupation with ritual cleanliness  over revelation in Christ and OT scripture)
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outline  of narrative structure</strong>:</p>
<p>Introduction statement:  Pharisees&rsquo; question (15:2): &ldquo;Why do Jesus&rsquo; disciples violate traditions by  eating with ritually unwashed hands?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Three scenes:
  <ul>
    <li>First scene (3-9)&mdash;addressing  the Pharisees
      <ul>
        <li>Tradition  invalidates the Law&mdash;rhetorical question v. 3
          <ul>
            <li>Example  of corban and Law&rsquo;s command to honor ones&rsquo; parents</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        <li>Advocates  of tradition are hypocrites
          <ul>
            <li>Indulging  in heartless, vain worship (Isaiah 29:13)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    <li>Second scene (10-11)&mdash;addressing the multitudes
      <ul>
        <li>Defilement  is the result of what comes out of a person, not what goes in</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    <li>Third scene (12-20)&mdash;addressing  the disciples
      <ul>
        <li>Parable  of the uprooted plant&mdash;directed against Pharisees</li>
        <li>Parable  of the blind guides&mdash;directed against Pharisees </li>
        <li>What  goes in does not defile, but what&rsquo;s in the heart&mdash;summary of 11, 17-19, &ldquo;these  things that defile&rdquo; of v. 20a</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusion statement: the heart, not unwashed hands, defiles the man  (v. 20)</p>

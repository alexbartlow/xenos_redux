<p>Tips  for identifying the main point of the passage:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Look for summary, conclusion, or introductory  statements, either given by the author (Luke 18:1; John 1:19, 2:11; 2:22) or as  a conclusion placed in the mouth of a character (Mt. 8:27; 12:12).</li>
  <li>Look for imperative (command) statements (Mt.  6:9; John3:7).</li>
  <li>Repetition of a key term or concept (Mt.  8-9--emphasis on Jesus' authority to act; Luke 15--the value of lost things).</li>
  <li>Context (Luke 18--Question of &quot;Who then can  be saved?&quot; is answered by Jesus that &quot;the things impossible for men  are possible with God.&quot; This is followed by salvation coming to Bartimaeus  and Zaccheus).</li>
  <li>Connective words such as &quot;thus,&quot;  &quot;therefore,&quot; &quot;so,&quot; and &quot;for this reason&quot; indicate  a conclusion (Mt. 10:16; 12:9-12).</li>
  <li>The use of figures of  speech such as irony (Mt. 8:22), parallelism (Mt. 9:12-13), <em>a fortiori</em> (Mt. 12:9-14), and the use of <em>truly</em> as an authoritative declaration  of fact.</li>
</ul>

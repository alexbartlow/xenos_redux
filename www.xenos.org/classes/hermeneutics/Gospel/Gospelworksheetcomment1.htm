<p> Read  the entire Gospel book, noting where the overall book breaks into passages  suitable for more in-depth study.  By reviewing the whole story each passage will make more sense by seeing how it  relates to the total picture. Such an overview will also help you get to the  Gospel&rsquo;s primary purpose, argument and intended audience.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Look for the interplay between narrative and  teaching.&nbsp; For example, see how the book  of Matthew lays out:</li>

<ul>
  <li>Look for section breaks according to theme. While  much of the Gospel writings are chronological, authors may shuffle this order  to accommodate a theme they are developing. See for example the thread of  parables in Luke 15:1-32 and Matthew 13. See also Mark&rsquo;s theme of Jesus&rsquo;  messianic signs inciting religious authorities in Mark 2:1-3:6</li>
  <li>Look for structural clues:
    <ul>
      <li>Changes       in audience (even subtle changes--&quot;Then he turned to his disciples and said...&quot;), location, time, or subject.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Summary,       transition, conclusion, and introductory statements. For example, Matthew includes       summary statements for the preceding events in 4:23-25, 7:28-29, 8:17, and       8:27. These are good points at which to mark the end of a passage.  </li>

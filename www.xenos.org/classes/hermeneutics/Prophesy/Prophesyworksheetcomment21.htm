<p>How does  the passage describe the human condition, in terms of failures, suffering,  value and virtue? </p>
<p>For instance, the prophets often denounce as &quot;harlotry&quot; (Hosea 1:2) Israel's idolatry. What does this mean?&#8212;rejecting God's covenant (Amos 4) and ignoring the needs of vulnerable people</p>

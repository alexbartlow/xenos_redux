<p>This term refers to the &quot;commentary&quot; provided within the Bible about its meaning. Biblical events and prophesies are often referred to in other portions of Scripture, and these references give us clues about the meaning and relevance of those events and prophecies. In this portion of study, consider how the prophecy you are studying contributes to the unity of the Bible as a whole.</p>

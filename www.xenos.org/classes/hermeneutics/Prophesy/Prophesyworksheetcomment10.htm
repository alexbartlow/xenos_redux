<p>Judgment  oracles describe God's plan to withdraw His  protection from Israel  them, allowing nations to rise up against them because Israel has violated  the covenant.&nbsp; Lev. 26:16b-39 stipulates  the penalties: deportation, destruction, disease, death, disgrace.&nbsp; Judgment oracles are conditional, leaving the door open to individual or national  repentance (see Jer. 18:5-12).</p>
<p> Judgment  oracles often come after denunciations,  and may be introduced with connective words such as &quot;therefore&quot; or  &quot;so&quot; (Jer 25:8ff; Amos 1)</p>
<p> <strong>Examples: </strong>Amos verses listed for  denunciation. Also, Zephaniah 1:2-18;&nbsp; Micah 5:10-15; 6:13-16.</p>

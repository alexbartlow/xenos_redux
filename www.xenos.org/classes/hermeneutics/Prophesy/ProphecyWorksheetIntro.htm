<p>Prophets were active throughout the Old Testament, serving  as God&rsquo;s mouthpiece, both &ldquo;forth-telling&rdquo;&mdash;describing the current state of  affairs&mdash;and &ldquo;fore-telling&rdquo;&mdash;describing events, judgments and blessings that were  to come, cited and applied in the New Testament, with application even today. </p>
<p>Prophets received their prophesy from directly from God  (Ezek. 28:1&mdash;&ldquo;the word of the Lord came to me...&rdquo;), through dreams and  interpretations (Daniel 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, &amp; 10), or through visions and  interpretations (Amos 8:1-3; Zech. 5:1-11).</p>
<p>Prophets were held to a strict standard of complete  accuracy, thus distinguishing them and their prophesies from the false prophets  of their time, and authenticating their words and their position as a prophet. See Isaiah  41:22-23, 26; 42:9: 43:9-10; 44:7- 8;  45:21; 46:10-11; and 48:5.</p>
<p>In Biblical history, most prophets are associated with the  time of the divided monarchy through the resettlement, approximately 800 BC to  400 BC.</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics  of prophets as preachers to their contemporary culture</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sensitive to evil: The society in which they  spoke often had become accommodating of and callous to evil. Prophets  sensitized people to their true spiritual state.<strong></strong></li>
  <li>Confrontational of covenant violations, calling  for social reform in areas such as:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Superficial and apostate religion. See Hosea 6:6; Isaiah 29:13; Jer. 2:8; 7:9-10</li>
    <li>Materialism,  a love of power, and the wisdom of the world. See Jer. 9:23-24</li>
    <li>Social  injustice. See Isaiah 10:2</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Often heavily burdened by their calling,  suffering in their role:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Threatened and rejected by people, as a sign of  their response to God. See Jer. 26:7-15</li>
    <li>Martyred. See Heb. 11:37</li>
    <li>Despairing. See Jer. 20:14-18</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Not selective in whom they guided or denounced,  serving an important role in guiding kings. See 2 Kings 19</li>
  <li>Were often personally affected by their visions,  experiencing horror from bleak predictions of judgments and intense joy from  visions of God&rsquo;s glory and salvation. They were not detached receivers and  communicators of God&rsquo;s word to people.</li>
  <li>Represented the humiliation of the people. 
    <ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
      <li>See Micah 2:8; Isaiah 20</li>
      <li>In the book of Hosea, Hosea&rsquo;s marriage to the  unfaithful Gomer served as a picture of Israel&rsquo;s unfaithfulness to God,  including the following elements:      
        <ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
          <li>Reason for marriage (1:2)</li>
          <li>Names of the children (1:3-9)</li>
          <li>Unfaithful and unknowing Gomer (2:1-13)</li>
          <li>Hosea pursues and redeems his wife (2:14-3:5)</li>
          <li>The children are redeemed (1:10-11; 2:1, 23)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

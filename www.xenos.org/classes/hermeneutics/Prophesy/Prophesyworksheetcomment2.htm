<p> An  oracle is a specific message from God. Prophetic books of the Bible are made up  of carefully organized oracles of a prophet.</p>
<p>Oracles can be identified  and delineated within a given book by looking for the following</p>
<ul>
  <li>A change in the narrative context or  subject:&nbsp; the &ldquo;who,&rdquo; &ldquo;where,&rdquo; and &ldquo;when.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>A change in the subject of the prophecy: e.g., from blessing to judgement, from Israel to other nations, etc.</li>
  <li>A repeated introduction. A section of Scripture  with repeated introduction should probably be considered part of the same  oracle. E.g., &ldquo;Thus says the Lord...&rdquo;; &ldquo;Then the Lord said to me...&rdquo;; &ldquo;The word  of the Lord came to me...&rdquo;; &ldquo;Hear the word of the Lord...&rdquo;; &ldquo;The Lord showed  me...&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Words designed to get a listener&rsquo;s attention  such as &ldquo;Hear&rdquo; or &ldquo;Woe.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

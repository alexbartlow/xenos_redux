<p> To  draw out the main point, look for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The repetition of key words that relate to the  promises and stipulations of the Mosaic Covenant (the basis of Israel&rsquo;s  blessing and judgment) or the Abrahamic Covenant (promise oracles, describing  how God will bless <em>all</em> nations).  Often an oracle's main point will related to these concepts. See Amos 1 &amp; 2.</li>
  <li>Declarations of God's verdict on a situation or  his plan for dealing with a situation. Often the oracle's details provide the  basis for God's verdict or plan. See Amos 1:3, 6, 9, 11, 13; 2:1, 4, 6.</li>
  <li>Connective language, which often directs you to  the main point such as: &quot;Therefore,&quot; &quot;thus,&quot;  &quot;so,&quot; &quot;as a result,&quot; &quot;consequently,&quot;  &quot;because,&quot; &quot;for,&quot; &quot;but,&quot; &quot;since,&quot; &quot;indeed.&quot; See Amos 4:12</li>
  <li>The author interjecting his own thoughts,  offering a concluding comment or summary statement. See Micah 4:5</li>
  <li>Imperatives. The command to  act is often the main point, with the rest of the oracle offering support for  this imperative. See Amos 3:1; 4:1; 5:1</li>
</ul>

<p> Denunciations  are God&rsquo;s way of reminding Israel  that it lives under the terms of a bilateral covenant (&ldquo;If...then&rdquo;). God&rsquo;s  blessing is secured as Israel  fulfills its obligation to obey the Law (Lev. 26:3). Failure to keep the  covenant results in a &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; verdict (Lev. 26:14-16a). Nations opposing God&rsquo;s  covenant people and who act treacherously against them are also confronted by  God.</p>
<p>Sometimes denunciations are  depicted as a criminal case God is presenting, prosecuting Israel and  using its history of disobedience as His evidence (see Micah 1:2). Terms such  as &ldquo;woe,&rdquo; &ldquo;lament,&rdquo; and &ldquo;taunt&rdquo; are commonly used.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong>: Hosea 1:1-9;&nbsp; Amos 1:3a, 6, 9, 11, 13, 2:1, 4, 6-8;&nbsp; Micah 1:2-5; 2:1,2;&nbsp; Zephaniah 3:1-6</p>

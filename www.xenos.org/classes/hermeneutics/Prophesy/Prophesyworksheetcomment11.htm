<p>Blessing  oracles describe how God will remain faithful  to His covenants. After a time of  judgment, God will restore Israel  to the land and continue the progress of salvation history (Lev. 26:40-46). The prophets envisioned a time of restoration of God&rsquo;s people in the land  and under His blessing.</p>
<p> Blessing  oracles often come after judgment oracles,  and sometimes after a call to repent (Joel 2:12-17, 18-27).</p>
<p> <strong>Examples</strong>: Amos 9:11-15; Jer.  16:14-15; 24:1-7</p>

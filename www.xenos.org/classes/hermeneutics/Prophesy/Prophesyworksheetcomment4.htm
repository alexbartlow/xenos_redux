<p>Examine  the setting for the oracle as much as possible, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Historical situation for Israel/Judah at the  time. If they were under a king at the time, what do we know about that king?  (look at the books of 1 &amp; 2 Kings and 1 &amp; 2 Chronicles) Were  Israel/Judah under attack at the time--by whom and why? What relationship did  the people have with God at the time?</li>
  <li>Information on the prophet  himself. What place did the prophet hold in society? What do we know about  their life and personality?</li>
  <li>What does the oracle say about the other nations or peoples? </li>
</ul>

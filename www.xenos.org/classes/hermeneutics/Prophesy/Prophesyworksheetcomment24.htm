<p>This type  of prophetic fulfillment happens at a point in history.&nbsp; Its fulfillment can take 2 forms:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Direct prediction:&nbsp; The prophecy is fulfilled by a specific  person or event:<u></u>
    <ul>
      <li>Isaiah  9:6-7: anticipated Davidic King Messiah</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Isaiah  52:13ff: enigmatic &quot;anonymous servant&quot;</li>
    <li>Daniel  2, 7, &amp; 8: emergence of specific kingdoms</li>
    <li>Micah  5:2:&nbsp; birthplace of the eternal ruler</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Multiple Reference Prediction: The  prophecy is fulfilled at 2 different times, with a &quot;gap&quot; in between.  It may be fulfilled in the short term, serving as a picture for a future  fulfillment, or it may be a dramatic picture of the end of history, which  provides a picture of a nearer term fulfillment that is to come. Here are some  suggestions for picking up on these type of prophetic fulfillments:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Semantic  clues: descriptions of a &quot;then and then&quot; fulfillment. See Joel 2:28.</li>
    <li>Temporal  clues: things that  could not be true of the historical description at hand.  Look at the verb tenses for clues. See Daniel 9:26.</li>
    <li>Content clues: descriptions  that relate to the <em>universal</em> and <em>eternal</em> rather than just covenant  blessings on Israel.  See Isaiah 19:1-15 &amp; 16-25</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

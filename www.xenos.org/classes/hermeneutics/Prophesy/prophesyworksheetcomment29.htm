<h3>Micah 4:1-5: Promise Oracle</h3>
<p>4:1 In the last  days&hellip;</p>
<ul>
  <li>The mountain of  God&rsquo;s Temple will be established as the chief of the mountains.  </li>
  <li>the nations  will stream to it</li>
</ul>
4:2 Nations  will come and say,
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to  the mountain of the Lord to be taught his ways and walk in his paths.</li>
  <li>From Zion will  go forth the law, the word of the Lord in Jerusalem</li>
</ul>
4:3-5 God will  judge between many peoples
<ul>
  <li>Swords will be  hammered into plowshares and spears into pruning hooks</li>
  <li>Nation will not  lift up sword against nation</li>
  <li>Never again will  they train for war</li>
  <li>Each will sit  under his vine and fig tree</li>
  <li>No one will  make them fear</li>
  <li>For the mouth  of the Lord of hosts has spoken.</li>
</ul>
Main point: Though all the  nations walk in the name of their god, we will walk in the name of the Lord  forever and ever.

  <li>Until <em>he pleads my case</em> and executes my  justice</li>
  <ul>
    <li>He will bring  me to the light and I will see his righteousness </li>
    <li>Then my enemy  will see and will be ashamed of taunting, &ldquo;Where is the Lord your God?&rdquo;</li>

  <li>I will show you  miracles</li>

  <li>He will again  have compassion on us, casting away our sins to the depths of the sea</li>
  <li>Who gives truth  to Jacob, unchanging love to Abraham, which you sword to our forefathers from  the days of old. </li>

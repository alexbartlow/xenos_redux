<p> What was  the historic environment of the prophet? As you read through the book, jot down your observations about Israel, Judah, and the other nations. Who are the prophecies directed toward? Is Israel at a time of peace or war? Who are Israel's neighbors that relate to the prophet's message? </p>
<p>From the text and from reference  books, glean as much as you can about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The social position and tribe of the prophet and  his family</li>
  <li>The king of Israel or Judah ruling at  that time. From this, look for the evaluation of this king in the narratives of  Kings and Chronicles. Were they kings who did evil or who followed God?&nbsp; This will provide a good sense of the  spiritual, moral, and political climate of the time, and to which the prophet  speaks.</li>
</ul>
<p>For  helpful information on the historical setting of a given prophet or king, see  John Walton&rsquo;s <em>Chronology and Background  Charts of the Old Testament</em>.</p>

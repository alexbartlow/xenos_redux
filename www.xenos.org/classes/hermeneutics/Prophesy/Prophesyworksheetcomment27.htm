<p>How is the  oracle rooted in the past, drawing upon what has already been revealed by God  in history, up to that point?&nbsp; See  Jeremiah 23:1-8 and notice all the themes and historic events drawn upon in  this passage. </p>
<p>How does the prophecy relate to past revelation? How does the prophecy relate to future revelation? Note, for instance, as Jeremiah looks to the time of a future blessing, that it is connected with the Ark of the Covenant and with Jerusalem, the &quot;throne of the Lord&quot; (Jeremiah 3:15-17)
  . How do these references bring together the Bible's picture of salvation? </p>

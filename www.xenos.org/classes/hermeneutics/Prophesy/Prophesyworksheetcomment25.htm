<p>Key events and institutions in the Old Testament have an underlying significance that look to the future. The clearest example of this is the sacrificial system in the Law, substituting an innocent on behalf of the guilty.</p>
<p>This  type of prophetic fulfillment is revealed not at a point in time, but as a  quality or characteristic that develops in the future. An example is the  concept of <em>redemption</em>, which is  predicted in many prophetic oracles. We see Jesus' death and resurrection  providing the opportunity for individuals to have their lives redeemed from  slavery to sin and futility. The fulfillment of this comes at their point of  conversion, but also through their lives, over time, as they allow God to  redeem their life, in a practical sense, to freedom from sin's grip and to  eternal usefulness.

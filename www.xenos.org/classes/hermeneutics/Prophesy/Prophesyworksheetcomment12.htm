<p>Promise  oracles depict God's plan--His promise of salvation--as being universal to all of mankind, even  cosmic, and eternal. They describe  how at the end of salvation history, God will rule personally through his Davidic king from Jerusalem. This will be a time of salvation,  peace, and abundance for those who yield to God, and of judgment for those who  resist His rule.</p>
<p> Promise  oracles are often combined with words of blessing. Look for breaks in the text  introduced by words like &quot;then,&quot; &quot;and then,&quot; and  &quot;after this.&quot; (Joel 2:28)</p>
<p> <strong>Example</strong>: Joel 2:28-32; Jer. 31:31-37; 23:3-8; Isaiah 9:6, 7</p>

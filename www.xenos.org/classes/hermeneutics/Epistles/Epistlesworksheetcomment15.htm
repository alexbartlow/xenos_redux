<p>As Paul encourages Timothy in the next paragraph to  &ldquo;fight the good fight&rdquo;, it is crucial for him to know why and how.&nbsp; This prayer of Paul&rsquo;s supplies it for him:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gratitude motivated: How extraordinary is Christ&rsquo;s salvation, that  we have not only forgiveness, but the honor to be pressed into the service of  the King!</li>
  <li>Divinely empowered: It is Christ who strengthens us.&nbsp; Timothy was all too aware of his fear and  anxiety. </li>
  <li>Drawing focus to the  Lord&mdash;in contrast to the human speculation  characteristic of the religion practiced by so many in Ephesus&mdash;and U. S.
  </li>
</ul>
</body>

The Epistles are a set of letters found in the New Testament  written by early church apostles to individuals or to churches. They are a  favorite genre of Biblical study because they offer a rich trove of theology,  as well as practical instruction for Christians and churches.</h3>
<p>Through these letters the authors sought to clarify doctrine  and its proper application, a very necessary task given the polytheistic Greco-Roman  world view the culture in which the early church was growing. Many times the  arguments advanced are an effort to clarify Christian doctrine against the  cultural grain. In 1 Corinthians 1:18, Paul admits these arguments may seem foolish  to people of the time, but they are based on God&rsquo;s revelation in history. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s helpful to understand the cultural point of view in  order to understand the logic and arguments being put forth by the authors. Often  the epistle authors write with three major viewpoints in mind:</p>
<p>1. Greek  Dualism</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This philosophy taught that reality is divided into the  spiritual and physical. Humans are spirits encased&mdash;or enslaved&mdash;in a physical  body. The authors of the epistles advanced both doctrinal and  practical arguments against dualism:</p>
  <p><em>Doctrinal</em> arguments against dualism:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dualism       conflicts with several attributes of Jesus including his full humanity (1 John       1:1, 4:1-2 &amp; John 1:14), full deity (Col. 2:9 &amp; Heb. 1:3), and the       fact that he experienced bodily resurrection from the dead (1 Cor.       15:1-17).</li>
    <li>Dualism       conflicts with the doctrine of the bodily resurrection of Christians (1       Cor. 15:12, 18, 19, 50-58)</li>
    <li>Dualism       conflicts with the singular authority of Christ to forgive sins and rule       creation since forgiveness was based on a blood-shedding atoning sacrifice,       and Jesus&rsquo; right to rule is based on his sacrifice (Col. 1:15-20).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Practical</em> arguments against dualism:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The philosophy       of dualism often led to pervasive license within the culture. If humans were       spirits trapped within a body, and the physical world was separated from       the spiritual world, then the physical could be indulged without it harming the spiritual. Paul uses Christian doctrine to argue against this       in 1 Corinthians 5:1-13 and 6:12-20.</li>
    <li>Conversely, the       philosophy of dualism also led to asceticism.       If the physical realm trapped and imprisoned the spiritual, then one might       be able to escape this prison by radical self-denial. See Paul&rsquo;s argument       against this in Colossians 2:20-23.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>2. Spiritual  Illumination by Mystical Experience</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Roman culture embraced mystery religions from  Asia, offering &ldquo;secret&rdquo; knowledge and mystical awareness&mdash;revelation&mdash;to those  willing to follow its often-bombastic rituals. In contrast, Christianity was  emerging with the offer of revelation through the observance and study of God&rsquo;s  movement in history and His communication of truth.</p>
  <p><em>Doctrinal</em> arguments against mystical revelation advanced by epistle authors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>God offers       objective revelation, in the face of the tendency toward &ldquo;gnosis&rdquo; and       false teachings (1 Tim. 6:20-21, Col. 2:8-9, 2 Cor. 10:3-5)</li>
    <li>Spiritual       revelation is based on historic fact (1 Cor. 15:1-10; see also Luke 1:1-4)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Practical</em> arguments against mystical revelation advanced by epistle authors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Group gatherings       were to be orderly, in contrast with the chaotic rituals of the mystics (1       Cor. 11:20-22; 14:6-19)</li>
    <li>They were to       stress faithfulness to the Word of God above experience. (Rom. 12:1-2)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>3. Cyclical  View of History</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Roman culture regarded man&rsquo;s existence as  being in an endless cycle, with both history and nature on an endless and  unchanging loop. There was no sense of ultimate purpose or destiny to human  history, and no sense of progression in history. This stands against the  epistle&rsquo;s argument for the importance of God&rsquo;s revelation of salvation over  time (1 Thes. 4:13-5:11), and the hope that Christians can derive from knowing  there is a beginning (Gen. 1:1), a meaningful sequence of events, and a final  culmination.</p>

<p>Tips 
  
for  finding supporting points in a given passage:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Look for connective words:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>&ldquo;Because&rdquo; or &ldquo;such as&rdquo;&mdash;often they justify or give reason for the main point.  (Rom. 5:6)</li>
    <li>&quot;But,&rdquo; &ldquo;however,&rdquo; or &ldquo;if&rdquo;&mdash;often they offer a contrast to the main point, or  qualify it. (Phil. 2:17)</li>
    <li>&ldquo;That&rdquo; or &ldquo;so that&rdquo;&mdash;often they apply the main point or show its results  (Col. 3:12)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Look for examples of a general principle: (1  Cor. 9:24)</li>
  <li>Look for indicatives&mdash;statements of truth that  motivate and inform imperatives (commands) (Gal. 5:17)</li>
  <li>Look for dependent clauses  that qualify or clarify the main point (Phil. 3:20-21&mdash;&ldquo;...<em>from which</em> we eagerly wait for a Savior <em>who will</em> transform the body of your humble state into conformity  with the body of His glory...&quot;</li>
</ul>

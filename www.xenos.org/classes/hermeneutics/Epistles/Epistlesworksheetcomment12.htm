<p>Identify  words or phrases that are intended to convey truth about God, man, salvation,  and discipleship. Understand how the words were used and understood by the  original audience. For example in 1 Tim. 1:12-17, Paul uses the terms &ldquo;king  eternal&rdquo; and &ldquo;glory&rdquo;&mdash;terms that indicate a sovereign ruler, worthy of being bestowed honor because of his superiority. Understanding the meaning of terms like this  greatly helps inform your  understanding of the passage.</p>

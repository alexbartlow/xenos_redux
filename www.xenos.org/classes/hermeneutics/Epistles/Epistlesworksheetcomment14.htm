<p>A Prayer of Paul </p>
<p> <strong>Main point</strong>:  Begins and ends with<em> praising God</em> (v.  12, 17)</p>
<ul>
  <li>The  Lord is indeed worthy of our praise!&nbsp; The  main point focuses on the absolute &ldquo;otherness&rdquo; of Christ, as eternal,  invisible, and immortal.&nbsp; Yet, at the  same time, He is our King and Lord&mdash;he relates to us in history and personally.</li>
  <li>Note  the details of word study on &ldquo;King&rdquo; and &ldquo;glory&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Gratitude  is the only appropriate, sane, response to genuine understanding of the  greatness of Christ.</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Supporting Point #1</strong>: We praise him because he gives us strength (v. 12)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Note  that we operate on the basis of the power of the invisible, eternal, immortal  King.&nbsp; (that&rsquo;s why we can &ldquo;do all  things&rdquo;&nbsp; Phil. 4:13)</li>
  <li>Specifically,  His strength is evident in:</li>
  <li>Putting  us in his service&mdash;no one is qualified to be God&rsquo;s servant, yet what a privilege  it is.</li>
  <li>In his  eternal being, he has more grace and mercy than I have sin</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Supporting Point #2</strong>: We praise him because of his redemptive power (v.  15)</p>
<ul>
  <li>An <em>a fortiori</em> argument&mdash;if Christ can save  Paul, he can save anyone!</li>
  <li>The  Judge of the universe is patient&mdash;note the repeated formula of the O.T., as  Jonah said, &ldquo;for I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to  anger and abundant in loving kindness, and one who relents concerning calamity&rdquo;  (Jonah 4:2).&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Conclusion</strong>: If we understand the depth of our sin, as Paul did so keenly, we will be driven by gratitude and thanks to Christ</p>

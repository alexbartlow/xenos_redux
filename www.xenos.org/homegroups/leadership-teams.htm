               <h1>Leadership Teams in Xenos</h1>
               <p>By <a href="../personal/den.htm">Dennis McCallum</a></p>
               <p>In the New Testament, <a href="../classes/um1-2.htm">eldership</a> is 
                 always plural. The accountability of collective leadership is an important 
                 control that we believe was intended by God because of the fundamental 
                 untrustworthiness of human nature. By entrusting the local church to a 
                 group of leaders, the likelihood that one person will go bad or be misled 
                 and destroy the church is reduced. Satan's task is made more difficult&#151;he 
                 must not only mislead and tempt an individual, but must win over a whole 
                 group of leaders to his ends. We believe the church would have done much 
                 better if it had stayed with plurality of leadership throughout its history.</p>
               <p>We know churches in the New Testament were organized with group elderships 
                 in each city. But we also know that there were often <a href="../teachings/nt/acts/dennis/act18-2.htm">multiple 
                   home churches within a given city</a>. How were the eldership teams related 
                 to the house churches in that city? Of this, we know little or nothing. 
                 Therefore, we conclude we are free to improvise in this area, as long 
                 as our structures result in the outworking of <a href="../classes/um2-1.htm">key 
                   principles</a> of church life. </p>
               <p><img src="graphics/groupofthree.jpg" width="200" height="239" alt="groupofthree" style="float:left; margin-right:10px" />In addition to eldership, New Testament churches had deacons, which means 
                 ministers, or servants. Nobody knows exactly what these ministers did, 
                 but judging from their qualifications, they were trusted servants of the 
                 church at a high level. While churches debate whether elders could include 
                 females, we think it is very clear that deacons could be <a href="../classes/um1-4.htm">male 
                   or female</a>.</p>
               <p>In Xenos, we have a board of  <a href="../aboutxenos/leaders.htm">elders </a>overseeing the network of house 
                 churches, but our home churches are led by deacons. We don't believe the 
                 Bible calls for plurality of deacons when they lead groups, but we often 
                 prefer plurality, not only for elders but for deacons, especially if they 
                 are going to lead a sizable group. Here are a number of practical and 
                 theological considerations regarding plural leadership:</p>
               <ul>
                 <li>
                   <p>A plurality of untrained, ignorant, and immature leaders is no more 
                     reliable than a single leader. Only if the leaders on a team are all 
                     trained and mature Christian workers can we assume that a group will 
                     be more reliable than an individual.  </p>
                 </li>
                 <li>We used to view our leaders as coequal within a team. Now we prefer 
                     to have a senior leader. Having a senior leader allows some insignificant 
                     decision to be made without a meeting, which is easier for everyone. 
                     Also, recognizing a senior leader authorizes that person to take initiative 
                     in leading the group, and in leading the leadership team. This counters 
                     the paralysis that may result from &quot;leadership by committee.&quot; However, a majority of the team can overrule a senior leader, so accountability 
                 is preserved. </li>
                 <li>
                   <p>Group size is the most important factor to consider when deciding whether 
                     to require plurality of leadership. To require plurality with even very 
                     small groups would unreasonably retard their ability to multiply. Also, 
                     the ratio of leaders to members would be unnecessarily low if small 
                     groups had to have plural leadership. Since most of our groups are house 
                     churches, with attendance between 15 and 60, we require true plurality 
                     in each one. Our smaller groups, on the other hand, may be led by an 
                     individual or a couple.                   </p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <p>Medium sized groups, like home churches, are large enough to have an 
                     identity as a group or a community, and may develop loyalty to their 
                     own home church, more than to the larger church. On the positive side, 
                     this makes home churches very hardy&#151;nearly indestructible. On the 
                     other hand, many churches are reluctant to establish medium sized groups 
                     because of their history of divisiveness. We think plurality of leadership 
                     is the answer to this<img src="graphics/threemen-pola.jpg" width="196" height="235" alt="three" style="float:right; margin-left:10px" /> negative tendency found in some medium-sized groups. 
                     While plural leadership may decide to divide from the rest of the church, 
                     it seems much less likely that an entire well-trained team would decide 
                     to take this unrighteous direction. During over 30 years of ministry, 
                     Xenos has experienced very little divisiveness from home churches. On 
                     the other hand, sometimes churches' efforts to prevent division cause 
                     more harm than division itself. We would rather have one or two home 
                     churches leave if they want to than have all our groups suffer based 
                   on the fear of division. </p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <p>The size of the group suggests that teaching is more appropriate than 
                     mere sharing. Many churches worry this could lead to doctrinal aberrations. 
                     Again, plural leadership and good training is the best safeguard against 
                     doctrinal error. We find very suspicious the thought (sometimes openly 
                     expressed by pastors) that to prevent doctrinal error we should keep 
                     leaders ignorant and teach groups not to study the Bible together.                   </p>
                 </li>
                 <li>Another potential negative for leadership teams is disagreement within 
                     the leadership team. Corporate leadership requires a willingness to 
                     accept limitations on autonomy and decision making that the immature 
                     find irksome if not unacceptable. Leaders must develop skills of negotiation 
                     and patient communication in order to form a successful team. Certain 
                     self-willed and dominating individuals are weeded out by their inability 
                     to function as team players, and this is all to the good. Any individual 
                     who is too self-willed to work with colleagues on a team is not welcome 
                 to lead in our church.                   </li>
                 <li>
                   <p>In Xenos, home church leaders are not empowered to remove other home 
                     church leaders from leadership. Only the elders can remove a home church 
                     leader. This prevents a majority from overrunning a minority in a team 
                     without outside confirmation. Sometimes, the lone dissenting leader 
                     is in the right!                   </p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <p>Whether to require plurality is determined not only by the size of 
                     a group, but by the scope of ministry delegated to home group leaders.  We believe having couples lead together is healthy for 
                     marriages, and we prefer people leading with their spouses.                    </p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <p>Not only the elders' minds are eased by plurality, but home church 
                     leaders find their own minds eased by the opportunity to bounce ministry 
                     questions off other leaders who are actually involved in their ministry 
                     with them. A lot of potential leaders are more willing to consider being 
                     part of a leadership team who would not feel comfortable taking on leadership 
                     by themselves.                   </p>
                 </li>

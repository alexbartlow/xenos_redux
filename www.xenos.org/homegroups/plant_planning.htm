         <h3>About this tool</h3>
               <p>Leadership of a home group can be a very confusing position. Many home
                 group leaders find themselves periodically overwhelmed with all the diverse
                 needs of a home group. As leaders, what elements of home group work should
                 we focus on? What problems are important and need to be addressed, and
                 which should we ignore? This paper has been helpful in getting leaders
                   to focus and plan in five critical areas. Doing this sort of planning
                 will help make the job feel more manageable and help leaders direct their
                 efforts. Leaders who have used this tool report that even though the
                 job is big they feel confident they are putting their efforts in the
            right place.</p>
               <h3>Using this tool</h3>
               <ul>
                 <li style="font-weight:normal"> Except for items I and II (see gray box above),
                 it doesn't matter which order various areas are addressed.</li>
                 <li style="font-weight:normal"> Plans presented here are samples; home group leaders should
                   customize their own plans according to their specific needs, situations
                 and opportunities.</li>
                 <li style="font-weight:normal"> This tool is designed to help home group leaders to understand their
                   job descriptions, and to help direct their focus and thinking about
                   their group. (A home group leader is responsible either to plan or
                   to delegate planning to others.)</li>
                 <li style="font-weight:normal"> This approach is just one way to understand home group ministry.
                   Of course there are important aspects missing; it's not meant to be
                   an exhaustive list of everything needed for leading a healthy
                   home group. (E.g., there's nothing here about unity, which is really needed.
                   Listen to the February 2002 Servant Team meeting tape to hear more
                 about unity.)</li>
                 <li style="font-weight:normal"> These items are universals and should
                   be included in the plan for every area. E.g., this whole paper
                 should be read under the umbrella of the doctrine of grace.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>As suggested by the article's title, the goal of a home group leader
                 should be to plant a healthy home group. Home groups must plant so that
                 more and more people can enjoy community without the group getting so
                 big there's no longer a sense of community to enjoy.</p>
               <p>For a greater understanding of the importance of church-planting read
                the essays about the <a href="../essays/index.htm">underground indigenous
                  church-planting movement</a>, and listen to the <a href="/teachings/topical/misc/index.htm"> Servant Team Retreat audio</a>.</p>
               <p>Therefore, the goal to plant the home group is the overarching emphasis
                 for everything that follows, and should be the factor that drives all
                 planning in the areas listed. Leaders should always have this goal in
                 mind, even if the actual planting date seems to be years away. Planting
                 is so healthy and imperative to the work of the church that we should
                 always be planning for it long before the room is full, and in some cases
       we should even plant before the room is full.</p>
               <p>Once leaders develop a <a href="../classes/leadership/planting.html">plant plan</a> for the
                 group, the group members will take planting all the more seriously. Sure,
                 any plan must be flexible and subject to change, but leaders should make
                 every effort to pick their best plan possible and then work toward it.</p>
               <p>What does it mean to get serious about planting rather than just going
                 through the motions? To illustrate this difference, compare a 30-year-old
                 guy who's been dating the same girl for years, and for years has been
                 saying, &quot;Yeah, sure, I want to marry you—someday,&quot; with the
                 guy who actually takes the necessary actions toward getting married:
            proposes, sets a date, and marries her.</p>
               <p>Do the group members view the leadership as serious about planting or
                 not? </p>
             <h3><a name="faithfulgod" id="faithfulgod"></a>I. A FAITHFUL GOD</h3>
               <p><i>Great news, leaders, no plan is needed here! We already have a faithful
                 God!</i></p>
               <p>God will grow His church:</p>
               <ul>
                 <li> In Matthew 16:10, Jesus states, &quot;…I will build my church, and
                   the gates of hell will not prevail against it.&quot; God will build
                 His church.</li>
                 <li> Paul says, in 1 Corinthians 3:6-7, &quot;I planted, Apollos watered,
                   but God was causing the growth. So then neither the one who plants
                   nor the one who waters is anything, but God who causes the growth.&quot; God makes
                 people and churches grow.</li>
                 <li> The parable of the mustard seed, in Matthew 13:31-32, teaches that
                   the church starts small and then grows into something huge. There
                     is no doubt God will cause his church to grow; He's already told
                 us he's serious about it.</li>
               </ul>
               <h4>What is the application for us?</h4>
               <p>Ephesians 2:10 states, &quot;For we are God's workmanship, created in
                 Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to
            do.&quot; </p>
               <p>God establishes our role in ministry. He has works prepared in
                 advance for us already. He's not up in heaven wringing his hands, all
                 worried, wondering if we'll ever have ministry success, wondering if
                 anything will ever go right in our service. He's not up there
                 wondering when our day is going to come; He's not worried whether our
            group is growing as fast as the next one. He knows all about it.</p>
               <p>Therefore, we don't need to worry about our ministry success
                 either. We don't need to dump any wasted energy into comparing ourselves
                 with others; we can look forward, obeying God and trusting Him that He's
          got some good work prepared for us to do.</p>
               <p>Understanding God's faithfulness to build His church and to establish
                 our ministry will cause us to experience more peace and to be more relaxed
                 as we minister, to lead more confidently, and to be more gracious with
                 ourselves and others during times of failure. We will exhibit a faith
                 in God that will attract others to the group.</p>
            <h3><a name="growingleaders" id="growingleaders"></a>II. GROWING LEADERS</h3>
               <p>This area is extremely important! </p>
               <p>&quot;Now for this very reason also, applying all diligence…faith…moral
                 excellence…knowledge…self-control…perseverance…godliness…brotherly kindness…and

               <p>Is it essential for Christians to make disciples—to do discipleship? Yes! We
                 leaders can be growing spiritually, and we can have a group that has
                 great evangelism and great community; but if there isn't the discipleship,
                 we're not going to raise up new leaders, and so we won't be able to plant

                   <p>This point goes along with the previous one. Many people say, &quot;We
                     want to have good community, but everyone just goes to whatever Central
                     Teaching (large meeting) they want to.&quot; This thinking is problematic!
                     How can you help each other evangelize when you don't even know when
                   your brother's bringing a new person to Central Teaching? </p>

                     hard at promoting attendance. Retreats are often the very times when
                     people (re-) dedicate themselves to serving God and His people. Members
                     who have been involved a long time sometimes forget that the retreats

         <h3><a name="evangelism" id="evangelism"></a>V. EVANGELISM </h3>
               <p>&quot;Now all these things are from God, who reconciled us to Himself
                 through Christ, and gave us the ministry of reconciliation, namely,
                 that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting
                 their trespasses against them, and He has committed to us the word of
                 reconciliation. Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though
                 God were entreating through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled
          to God&quot; (2 Corinthians 5:8-10).</p>
               <p>This area is crucial. We can have a lot of the other areas in order,
                 but if we don't have good evangelism, our home groups are in big trouble.
                 In fact, if your home group is currently struggling, the first two areas
                 to look at are growing leaders and evangelism. If you don't
            have one or both of these in order, start there.</p>
               <p>Evangelism is another good area for delegating. When making an evangelism
                 plan, get a lot of people in the mix, especially strong evangelists.
                 Get committed Christian workers together. E.g., fill a legal pad with
                 ideas for what you could do for evangelism, and then from those ideas
                 create a 1-year skeleton plan. Also good communication of ideas and
                   vision on these plans is essential. No matter how great a plan is,
                 it's useless if no one knows about it. Reevaluate and extend this one-year
            plan every few months.</p>

        <h3><a name="problem_meetings" id="problem_meetings"></a>The Most Common Problems With Home Group Meetings</h3>
               <ul>
                 <li>
                   <p><strong>Teaching too long</strong><br />
                     Thirty minutes is recommended for teachings in a home group setting. People
                     need the opportunity to participate during the meeting to experience
                   openness and community and to actively interact with God's word.</p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <p><strong>Weak application to everyday life</strong><br />
                     The teaching may be interesting and full of content, but so often the application
                     is weak or unclear. People should consistently leave home group realizing
                     God has spoken to them and they know what they could do differently in
                     their lives to cooperate with God. Application to people's everyday lives
                     should be very clear and specific. (E.g., rather than people
                     coming away thinking, &quot;I want to be more loving,&quot; they could
                     be thinking, &quot;I think I'll make some phone calls this week, initiate
                     having Wilma over for dinner, and see if Betty wants to pray with me
                   this week.)</p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <p><strong>Not lively enough</strong><br />
                     This point applies both to the teacher and the members. </p>
                   <ul>
                     <li> Monotone teachers need to work hard to get a little inflection
                       into their voices, even if it feels uncomfortable. Get lively.
                       Have good, upbeat illustrations and personal vulnerability. </li>
                     <li> Members can help out here, too. Rather than falling asleep during
                       the teachings, people could nap beforehand, drink coffee, and come
                       prepared to contribute to the meeting.</li>
                     <li> Teachers should work in plenty of opportunities for participation
                       in the middle of the teaching. </li>
                   </ul>
                 </li>
                 <li><strong>Dull atmosphere</strong><br />
                   Exercise creativity in making home group night a special night. Prepare
                   special snacks, build a fire...anything to foster a time of extended
                   community. </li>
               </ul>

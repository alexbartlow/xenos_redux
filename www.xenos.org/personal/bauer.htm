			  Division Coordinator</h2>
			
			<p>Hi, I'm Steve Bauer. I'm glad you're here at my personal page. I'd like to  share a short version of my life in God's church and here at Xenos</p>
			<p>I came to work at this uniquely God-led organization in May of 1995. I thought that after a few years I could make an impact and move on to other  endeavors. Little did I know plans God  had in store for me.  I worked in the for-profit corporate world for 12 years. When I  began work for Xenos, a church where I met Christ in 1988, I didn't fully  understand the breadth of career change I would experience (<span class="style8">big  understatement</span>). What a rewarding challenge - to be able to match career  experience and work strengths with ministry to the church in pursuit of spiritual  growth. </p>
<p>Beyond the church work I'm blessed to be able to do, I am so joyful to be part of a local church in which  God manifests His grace and love so actively through His people. Ministry opportunities abound in and through  Xenos. I am part of a dynamic and  diverse home group here at Xenos and serve as senior leader there. I am one of  the older members, chronologically, but more importantly as a maturing (though  farther from mature each year it seems) Christian.  I believe as we grow more in Christ we learn  more how far from His character we truly are, driving me to His grace.   It has been a true joy to help younger Christians discern God's word and make  tough life decisions within a biblical world view. I worked in the <a href="../ministries/jrhigh/index.htm">Junior High ministry</a> for 12 years, a true stretch of faith for me to give myself away, and I have now returned to middle school ministry as my nephew and then my own children have reached that age. I help lead a Bible study in a local nursing home, which is an incredible blessing. </p>
<p>I have had an amazing journey in growing a wonderfully unique family. In September 1998, we traveled to Hainan, China to adopt our beautiful, energetic and loving 9 month old daughter, Andrea Li. After having this captivating child home for a year, we felt the need to give her a sibling to teach and learn from. We traveled to Cambodia in March 2000 to receive our 2 month old son, Evan Arthur (middle name is my dad's). Our experience with him was (and is) so different from what it has been with Andrea. I will never again listen to those who say that gender is learned through environment over physiology - boys are a world of difference from the fairer sex from day one. Evan's a great gift to me from God, and Andrea is the shining apple of my eye. I only wish they wouldn't grow up so quickly. </p>
<p><img src="graphics/PetrifiedForestFam.jpg" width="197" height="140" hspace="5" align="left"></p>
<p>God blessed me in the fall of 2003 with a new partner for life, Malia. I had became a widower in January 2003, losing my partner, friend and co-worker for Christ. I was blessed to have Marilyn in my life for almost 23 years, with almost 19 as my spouse. She was absolutely sure of her eternal destiny in God's hands, and felt she was leaving the world a legacy of two amazing children. And we will all one day be reunited with no more tears!</p>
<p><span class="style10">What a great family to travel with !! <span class="style11">(this time in Arizona's 'Painted Desert and Petrified Forest' National Park')</span></span></p>
<p>God made it so clear that Malia and I were to be together, through many avenues. I feel like <img src="graphics/MaliaSteve.jpg" width="143" height="99" align="right"> Job at the end of his travails, as his life is put into perspective with God -- in Job 42:12 the Bible relates that God blessed Job &ldquo;in the second half of his life&rdquo; (<span class="style8">NLT</span>) greater than in the first. I am a living testament to that kind of incredible grace and loving gift, as He chose me as Malia's husband. His plan for me has been a great one. </p>
<p>I'm always happy to have Columbus as the place I return to when I travel, since Malia and I are blessed to have extended family here and are part of such a unique and wonderful church. </p>
<h5>Specifics of My Current Work </h5>
<p>My position as Operations Coordinator keeps me busy with overseeing the many  administrative aspects of church. I oversee facility development (including  construction projects) and maintenance, information systems, accounting, office  management, and light &amp; sound systems for our meetings, events and  seminars. I also serve as the church&rsquo;s human resources director. I also am privileged to oversee the  facilities and systems at Urban Concern, our inner-city 501(c)(3)  ministry, and am responsible for facilities and systems at multiple locations  for Xenos Christian Schools.  When I explain this role to friends and family who haven't had contact with  such a job, I usually explain that I oversee, &quot;the indirectly spiritual  areas that support and affect the work in the church&rsquo;s directly spiritual  activities&quot;. As secretary / treasurer  of our corporation and also for Urban Concern, I've been able to have a complete  first-hand view of the inner operations of our organization. </p>
<p>I've earned a working degree in construction management... As part of my initial work for the church, I was responsible for oversight  of the construction of our <a href="../admin/site.htm">Main  Campus</a> on the 60+ acre site Xenos bought in 1991. After spending a large  part of my time in 1995 through 1997 with bankers, lawyers, construction  managers and related professionals, we finally reached the point where our two  main facilities were completed. More productive offices, our extensive <a href="../ministries/studycenter/index.htm">library</a>,  enhanced youth facilities and large meeting capability are really paying off in  God's work. We moved into our meeting facility and classroom space in August,  1997 and are reminded constantly of God's blessing through these enhanced  facilities, especially as we look back to where we came from. In 1999, we added  another facility to our campus - a 12,000 sq. ft. building oriented toward the  needs of our youth, &lsquo;Building X&rsquo;. Another major addition was completed in 2001  - a 6,000 sq. ft. addition to our Main Campus, referred to as &lsquo;The Atrium&rsquo;. In  2006 we completed a unique &lsquo;Cafe&rsquo; addition to our facilities &ndash; a modern and  warm large meeting space (for 400 people) with a full service kitchen  attached. What we learned from other  building projects went into creating a very usable space that includes  dedicated a small child play area viewed from the main meeting area, along with  a huge play room for older children.  With this addition, our Main Campus facilities have almost 92,000 square  feet of ministry space, along with outstanding grounds (including fire pits and  our 1-mile loop through woods and hills).  God has certainly supplied for the needs of His church on our main site.</p>
<p>In 2005 we started two major construction projects in the urban areas of Columbus &ndash; in South Linden  and in the Ohio State University District.  I was able to be a key part of the acquisition of properties in those  neighborhoods, working with city officials and various community groups. Our goal was to build facilities to get God&rsquo;s  church deeply invested into these &ndash; some of the most desolate and forgotten  areas of our community. Over the next 2  years Xenos went from planning to building and renovating 2 incredible new  facilities in those areas. Our <em><a href="../ministries/college/cafe.htm">4th    Street</a></em><a href="../ministries/college/cafe.htm"><em> Study  Center &amp; Coffee Bar</em></a> and <em>4th St. Pavilion</em> were open in phases from 2007  into 2008. Over 43,500 square feet of  ministry facilities now serve the OSU area, providing a home for our growing college  group and our adult church sphere in that area.  The <em>Harambee Christian School  &amp; Community Center</em> is a jewel in the South Linden  community, from which we serve the poor in the area and seek to show God&rsquo;s love  to the lost and hopeless. Over 30,000  sq. feet of space house a K-5 school, with extra room to grow, along with an  incredible gymnasium and grounds. I  have been blessed to be at the center of the development of each of these  God-honoring facilities and feel I've earned a degree in construction  management through my oversight of each phase of the process &ndash; from need  definition to conceptual development to fund-raising and on to reality.</p>
<p>I would be very happy to discuss any aspect of practical church organization  and management, finance, construction or related (and even unrelated) areas of  church work and life.</p>
<h5>Some Brief Thoughts on My Early Life and Early Work Background</h5>
<p>I grew up in Upper Arlington, a wealthy suburb in Columbus, Ohio. We weren't necessarily &quot;rich&quot; by the standards of the community there, but I never wanted for anything and grew up believing money and position were tantamount to happiness in this life. I was baptized and confirmed as a Lutheran, before leaving the church as a teenager to pursue my own agenda and just have fun. After 15 years of seeking after all the world had to offer, a friend invited me to &quot;come and see&quot; what he had found at Xenos. The rest is history unfolding, as I feel I answered a deep call on my soul that could only have come from God. </p>
<p>I spent 9 years with the management consulting firm, Andersen Consulting / Accenture, moving toward partnership as a senior manager until 1992, focused on the manufacturing industry. I then spent  3 years with Nationwide Insurance as Systems and Programming Director, with an investment products focus. I gained a capacity to work hard and grew in experience through these incredible career opportunities and am very thankful for those jobs. I did not want to really leave my first position out of college with Andersen, but change came as God called on me to give greater weight to my family, friends and my relationship with Him. Some are able to handle the pressures and constraints in careers that will take all you will give, but I couldn't seem to draw very good lines between work-life and &quot;everything else&quot; without a renewed perspective. Nationwide was a great fit for my life, a great company filled with opportunities, and I would not have left without a the clear vision painted for me by God and by my friends when a role in the church came calling.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
</b><i>

<p>Christianity: The Faith That Makes Sense</i> has been used by God to lead many to
personal faith in Jesus Christ. This study guide is intended to help Christians use <i>Christianity:
The Faith That Makes Sense</i> more effectively as a witnessing tool by discussing the
issues in greater depth. The guide can be used either for individual study or for group
study. We will address a group facilitator throughout and individuals can simply ignore
the group discussion suggestions.</p>

<p>For each chapter, read the section in <i>Christianity: The Faith That Makes Sense</i>
first. If you are leading a group you must consider whether or not your members will do
the reading outside the group. If you suspect members have not read the chapter, you can
read either the chapter or relevant sections in the group by going around taking turns
reading aloud. Then compare answers to selected study questions.</p>

<p>You may copy this study guide and distribute it free of charge provided you show the
author&#146;s name and you do not alter the text except for dividing it into manageable
sections. Feel free to address any questions to the author or members of the Crossroads
Project staff at our web site: http://www.crossrds.org or from the <i><a href="fms.htm">Christianity:
The Faith That Makes Sense</a></i>page. You can also buy quantities of <i>Christianity:

<font size="4"><b>

<p>Chapter 1 The Worst Party Ever

<ol>
  </b></font><i>
  <li>Christianity: The Faith That Makes Sense</i> begins with a metaphor of a party where
    everyone dies within three hours. How do you see this party fitting into the communication
    strategy of the book?<br>
    <i><br>
    The party is intended to emphasize the need to consider spiritual things. In an age of
    apathy and cynicism, our first task is to persuade non Christians to engage with us. A
    story or metaphor like this may prick a sense of need that could lead to further talk.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">How would you react to the suggestion by a non Christian reader that being
    ushered into such a party is unfair, and any God who would create such a situation should
    not be acknowledged?<br>
    <i><br>
    Ask, &quot;How do you define fair?&quot; and &quot;Where does your sense of fairness come
    from?&quot; Point out that, in reality, God doesn&#146;t actually inject each person with
    a virus&#151;the virus is a result of our own autonomy. The amazing thing is that God gets
    involved in our bad situation and rescues us.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">Aside from the duration of the party being different from the duration of our
    lives, can you think of any other differences or discontinuities between the metaphor and
    real life?<br>
    <i><br>
    To be completely fair, we should imagine, not one witnesser with a door he claims leads to
    health, but a few hundred all claiming that their door is it. The individual would have to
    try to discern which one(s) are more credible. However, we also must stress that just
    because there are many false claimants doesn&#146;t mean none of them are true.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">For postmodern or relativistic readers, consider a person who refuses to
    believe in the reality of the deadly virus and insists that because his belief's are
    different, his fate will be different also.<br>
    <i><br>
    His belief's are irrelevant. He will die like the rest.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">Do your friends have a strong sense of purpose in their lives? If so, what is
    it? If not, are they bothered by this lack? Should they be?<br>
  </li>
  <li value="1">As Christians, what is the purpose of our lives?<br>
  </li>
  <li value="1">A non Christian says, &quot;A life doesn&#146;t have to be eternal to be
    meaningful.&quot; How would you respond?<br>
    <i><br>
    We should ask, what then is that meaning? If all are here momentarily, and our world is
    also momentary in the history of the universe, why would any thing be meaningful in the
    ultimate sense?</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">If you were really in such a party and found a door leading to life, would you
    go back to lead others out?<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<b><font size="4">

<p>Chapter 2</p>
</font>

<p>Ground Rule 1: Reason Works

<ol>
  </b>
  <li>Many today, including Christians, doubt that reason can tell us much in the spiritual
    realm. What do you think?<br>
    <br>
    Answers to this question will help reveal postmodern attitudes in the group.</li>
  <li value="1">Can we deny the validity or the importance of reason but still stick up for
    truth?<br>
    <i><br>
    No, we cannot. Truth is only meaningful when juxtaposed to falsehood. Apart from reason,
    the true and the false can both be right. Only when we exclude the possibility that a
    thesis and its antithesis cannot both be right at the same time is truth objective. If
    both a thesis and its antithesis can be right at the same time, what is a lie anyway?</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">Can you think of any other area of knowledge that requires both reason and
    experience?<br>
    <i><br>
    Learning to drive; playing music; speaking a language; appreciating the northern lights.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">Do you think some Christian doctrines such as the trinity are beyond or above
    reason? Can something be beyond human comprehension but still compatible with rationality?<br>
    <i><br>
    Explain the difference between something that is irrational and something that is
    incomprehensible. You may may not comprehend how your copying machine works, but that
    doesn&#146;t mean it&#146;s irrational. Likewise, we may not understand some aspects of
    the infinite God, but we err if we claim he is irrational. The trinity is one in essence,
    three in person. This is not irrational, even though we have never experienced such a
    thing and cannot comprehend it. God says he cannot tell a lie.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">Consider the concept of a square triangle. Can such a thing exist? How do you
    know?<br>
    <i><br>
    A contradiction in terms is irrational and self-refuting. The universe is real and created
    by a rational God, not a dream state where anything can happen. Eastern gods contradict
    themselves, not the God of the Bible.</i></li>
</ol>
<b>

<p>Ground Rule 2: Burden of Proof

<ol>
  </b>
  <li>Can you think of another illustration, besides the coin flipped, showing that neither
    side carries the burden of proof?<br>
  </li>
  <li value="1">If we, as Christians, believe we have the burden of proof, what effect might
    such a belief have on our witnessing?<br>
    <i><br>
    It could lead to more aggressive use of arguments, or a tendency to inflate the importance
    of significance of some arguments. It could lead to denial of valid points made by our
    opposition.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">Can you think of any illustration (other than the lost peanut butter jar)
    where reasonable faith makes sense?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<b>

<p>Ground Rule 3: No Inescapable Proof

<ol>
  </b>
  <li>Can you think of any world view that can prove itself?<br>
  </li>
  <li value="1">Does naturalism (e.g. Atheism or agnosticism) require faith? Why or why not?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li value="1">If McCallum is right that no world view can be proved, can we really know
    anything? How would you differentiate between Christianity and any other opinion?<br>
    <i><br>
    Faith is required, but reasonable faith is plausible faith&#151;faith that doesn&#146;t
    deny itself; faith that answers the main questions facing us. We don&#146;t need to know
    with absolute certainty, we have relative certainty.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">Is the person who claims to believe in nothing at all actually believing in
    something? What about the person who says there are no universal truths?<br>
    <i><br>
    Yes. This person believes that no point of view merits belief. But this is itself a point
    of view. To say there are no universal truths is a universal truth claim. This statement
    can&#146;t possibly be right!</i></li>
</ol>
<b>

<p>Ground Rule 4: Experience Must Be Added To Reason

<ol>
  </b>
  <li>Name some things you know because of your experience.<br>
    <i><br>
    What the color blue is.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">Name two things that cannot be known any way other than experience.<br>
    <i><br>
    Love; beauty</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">One author claims that anyone who honestly turns to God and asks for an
    experience of his reality will be saved eventually. What do you think of such a claim?</li>
</ol>
<font size="4"><b>

<p>Chapter 3 The Core of Christian Teaching</p>
</b></font>

<p>&nbsp;

<ol>
  <li>How would you define grace?<br>
  </li>
  <li value="1">Do you agree that grace is the heart of the biblical message, or do you see
    something different?<br>
    <br>
    Look for emphasis in biblical teaching through two avenues: the strength of the language
    used when teaching (i.e. emphatic language), and repetition. For the Old Testament suggest
    that the notion of lovingkindness (chesed) corresponds to the New Testament concept of
    grace (charis).</li>
  <li value="1">What evidence can you think of for, or against, the biblical view on the
    nature of man? (Think of history, children, your own life etc.)<br>
    <i><br>
    History provides scant evidence of the goodness of all people. Children are born willing
    to fight, lie, and steal. They must be trained to behave socially. With yourself, focus on
    motives, not just actions. Remember sins of omission.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">What sins are most characteristic of fallen humans?<br>
    <i><br>
    Selfishness, autonomy, pride, lust and hate must rank high.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">Why does the author think that the idea of works salvation implies that God is
    unloving or unwelcoming? Do you agree?<br>
  </li>
  <li value="1">Can you think of any religious system other than Christianity that does not
    teach works salvation?<br>
    <i><br>
    Some extremely passive interpretations of eastern mysticism (e.g. formal Taoism) argue
    that the key to life is to do nothing. However, even these teach a form of karma, where
    what you do comes back to you in measure.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">McCallum cites Romans 3 and the phrase &quot;the just and the justifier.&quot;
    What does this phrase mean? How could you explain it to a non Christian?<br>
  </li>
  <li value="1">Some Christian teachers and Christian-based cults mistakenly teach that works
    are either the main key, or an essential part of salvation. Who do you know that argues
    works salvation for Christians, and how would you counter such claims?<br>
  </li>
  <li value="1">Read the citations from Islamic, Jewish, and Catholic religious texts. All
    three of these religions are very important because all are theistic, just like biblical
    Christianity. Interestingly, all three come from a biblical tradition. Do you agree that
    the passages cited show that these religions teach salvation by works? Are you aware of
    any claims to the contrary?<br>
    <i><br>
    Many liberal American Jewish congregations are universalistic (See below ch. 9). So are
    individual Catholics. But Catholic dogma is clear that not only grace, but works are
    essential for eternal life.</i></li>
</ol>
<font size="4"><b>

<p>Chapter 4</p>
</b></font>

<p>&nbsp;

<ol>
  <li>This chapter focuses on arguments, not for Christianity specifically, but for the
    existence of God. Surveys show that over 90% of Americans believe in a god or gods. What,
    then is the usefulness of this material?<br>
    <i><br>
    Many are not formal atheists, but are practical atheists. Also, of those claiming to
    believe in God, probably half or more to not accept an infinite, personal God like the God
    of the Bible. These arguments will not support pantheistic ideas of God.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">What is another good illustration (besides the Taj Mahal) for the argument
    from design?<br>
  </li>
  <li value="1">The genius of the presuppositional argument is that it points out, not just
    what is likely or unlikely (like the argument from design) but what is consistent or
    inconsistent with one&#146;s own presuppositions. Why is this relevant for witnessing
    Christians?<br>
    <i><br>
    Presuppositional arguments can refute individual world views, which is often necessary.
    Likewise, by a process of elimination, it can point the way to biblical Christianity,
    which alone is able to be completely self-consistent.<br>
    Facilitators should be aware that the form of pressuppositional argument given here is not
    the classical pressupositionalism of Cornelius Van Til, but a modified pressuppositional
    argument more like that advanced by Francis Schaeffer.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">Why is the man&#146;s suggestion that they change their currency incompatible
    with his view of the rocks spelling <i>Canadian Railways</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?<br>
    <i><br>
    Just checking to make sure they can articulate how this argument works.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">Postmodern thinkers claim that it doesn&#146;t matter if they are inconsistent
    with their own presuppositions because everyone is inconsistent. Is this true?<br>
    <i><br>
    No. Christians may not be consistent, but this is because of personal failure, not because
    our faith makes it impossible to be consistent. Another world view is able to be

<p>Chapter 5 God&#146;s Chosen Method of Self-authentication</p>
</b></font>

<p>&nbsp;

<ol>
  <li>What are the problems and the possible strengths for each of the following means of
    authentication for Christianity or any other truth claim?<br>
    l<br>
    - The evidence of miracles<br>
    <i><br>
    Weakness: Must be authenticated&#151;hard to tell if real. Hard to repeat for every
    person. Might be duplicated by occult religion.<br>
    Strength: points directly to the supernatural.<br>
    <br>
    </i>- The evidence of others&#146; testimony<br>
    <br>
    <i>Weakness: People make mistakes and they lie. How do we know who to believe among
    conflicting testimonies?</i><br>
    <i>Strength: If we know or trust the person, it can be very convincing.<br>
    <br>
    </i>- The evidence of historical reliability of the Bible<br>
    <br>
    <i>Weakness: Can be complicated and hard to explain. Does not point to inspiration
    necessarily. Only convincing if people accept our methodology.</i><br>
    <i>Strength: Depending on one&#146;s presuppositions, can tip the scale in favor of
    belief.<br>
    <br>
    </i>- Rational consistency with its own propositions<br>
    <br>
    <i>Weakness: Only shows consistency with a given paradigm, therefore not necessarily
    binding on other paradigms. Some don&#146;t value consistency.</i><br>
    <i>Strength: Can set Christianity apart from other self-refuting views.<br>
    <br>
    </i>- Correlation between claims made in a religious text and provable things outside that
    text (eg. in nature)<br>
    <br>
    <i>Weakness: Only demonstrates that some parts of a text are valid, not all parts.
    Requires interpretation of the text.</i><br>
    <i>Strength: Can point directly to the reliability of the Bible if handled well.<br>
    <br>
    </i>- The historical argument for the resurrection of Christ<br>
    <br>
    <i>Weakness: Can be hard to explain or defend. Relies on convincing non Christians that
    it&#146;s more likely that someone rose from the dead than that religious people would
    lie.</i><br>
    <i>Strength: Depending on one&#146;s starting point, it can move someone from general
    respect for Christ and the Bible to personal faith. When handled by a master rhetorician
    it can and has led many to Christ (e.g. C.S. Lewis&#146; Mere Christianity).<br>
    <br>
    </i>The argument that Jesus must be true because I have experienced him in my heart<br>
    <br>
    <i>Weakness: Same argument is advanced by Buddhists, New Agers, and Cultists.</i><br>
    <i>Strength: Supremely convincing to the one having the experience. Also convincing to
    others if they trust the one with the experience.<br>
    <br>
    </i>- The argument that God alone can tell the future course of human history, and has
    done so in the Bible.<br>
    <br>
    <i>Weakness: Can be difficult to explain, requires study. Requires interpretation of
    biblical prophecies. Must verify the dates of texts and that fulfillment actually
    occurred. Finally must be able to rule out deliberate fulfillment (e.g. Jesus riding into
    Jerusalem on a colt of a donkey could have been deliberate fulfillment of Zech 9:9).</i><br>
    <i>Strength: Can point directly and exclusively to Jesus Christ and the Bible. If handled
    well, the few predictions that meet all these conditions can be very convincing, even to
    skeptics if they come to believe our interpretations of the passages are fair.<br>

<ol>
  <li>According to McCallum, the servant songs describe the life and ministry of Jesus in
    detail. Is this true? The best way to study the servant songs is to read them along with
    the intervening material and record inductive conclusions as you go. Compare your work
    with commentaries. See if you end up with an outline similar to the one in Chapter 6 of <i>Christianity:
    The Faith That Makes Sense</i>. <br>
    <br>
    <i>The point here is to make readers aware that there are problems in the interpretation
    of these passages, contrary to the inflated claims of some Christian apologists. On the
    other hand, the main picture is clear. Perhaps, if going through the passages is
    unrealistic for your group, you could pick some examples out for examination.</i><br>
  </li>
  <li value="1">While becoming familiar with the strengths of these predictions, acknowledge
    the problems as well. How do you account for the following features of the anonymous
    servant songs?</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <dir>
    <dir>
      <ul>
        <li>The servant is anonymous. Why?</li>
        <li>The servant is never called Messiah or linked directly with that role as portrayed in
          other passages. Why?</li>
        <li>The songs portray events and roles from both first and second comings of King Messiah,
          but never mention there will be two comings. Why?</li>
        <li>In the context of the intervening passages between the servant songs, God refers to
          &quot;my servant Israel&quot; or &quot;my servant Jacob.&quot; (Is. 41:8,9; 43:10;
          44:1,21; 45:4) Why would God confuse readers by referring to one servant by name (Israel)
          and another servant anonymously? Isn&#146;t the first rule of interpretation to interpret
          according to context?<br>
          <i><br>
          Yes, but in the case of these passages, we cannot make sense of them when applied to the
          Jewish people. See the endnotes from this chapter in fms.<br>
        </li>
        </i>
        <li>Why is the anonymous servant also called &quot;My servant Jacob?&quot; (Is. 49:3)<br>
          <br>
          While answers to all these issues exist, they do pose potential problems in witnessing. By
          learning an appropriate response to each, you will be better equipped to witness, even
          though you will probably not want to get into this level of detail unless the person you
          are communicating with asks.<br>
          <br>
          McCallum advances the suggestion that most of these problems may be related to the notion
          of the Messianic secret referred to in these passages and others: Eph. 3:6-10; Col.
          1:25,26; Rom. 16:25; I Cor. 2:8; I Pet. 1:12. See the endnotes for this chapter in fms.</li>

<p>Chapter 7 The Time of Christ&#146;s Coming Predicted</p>
</b></font>

<p>Daniel 9 is a remarkable prophecy, but some people steer away from it because it is
complicated. Yet, as you can see from this chapter of <i>Christianity: The Faith That
Makes Sense</i>, it is possible to summarize and simplify the passage enough to use
effectively in evangelism.</p>

<p>Let&#146;s look at Daniel chapter 9 and gain a better understanding of the background
and basic interpretive issues:

<ol>
  <li>Daniel 9:1 dates this vision as being in &quot;In the first year of Darius son of
    Xerxes.&quot; We have no record of Darius, but we know Xerxes well from history. Since
    Daniel says Darius &quot;was made ruler&quot; we can assume he was a viceroy serving under
    Xerxes, the new Persian ruler. Look in a Bible dictionary and find out when Xerxes
    conquered Babylon.<br>
    <i><br>
    For most of these, just try to ascertain that members are doing the work and see what
    their answers are.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">Daniel says his reflection began when he read in Jeremiah the number of years
    for the Jewish exile in Babylon. (See Jeremiah 25:11) Considering that Daniel was taken
    into exile with the first group of captives in about 605 BC, (and remembering that years
    go down instead of up in the BC period) about how many years had passed since his capture?<br>
    <i><br>
    About 70 years, especially when including the Hebrew tendency to count any part of a year
    as a whole.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">As Daniel prays and confesses the sins of the people, he also mentions the
    curse that Moses warned them about. Read Leviticus 26:33-35 in context. Their
    unfaithfulness had resulted in their exile, but somehow the &quot;sabbatical year&quot;
    was involved as well (see chapter 24:1-6). This link is important, because the Sabbaths of
    years in the last part of the chapter have this as their context. Read also IIChronicles
    36:20-22. Here again, we see reference to the Jeremiah prediction, to Xerxes, and to the
    sabbatical years, of which 70 had apparently been ignored.<br>
    <i><br>
    Some translations merely says &quot;70 weeks&quot; instead of &quot;70 sevens&quot; thus
    making it harder to understand. See margin of NASB.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">In verse 24, Gabriel says God will allow the Jewish people 70
    &quot;sevens&quot; or <i>shabuim</i> (from which we get the word &quot;Sabbath&quot;). Now
    you can see why the context dictates that these be Sabbaths of years, not of days. Now
    read the list of things the Jewish people must do to complete their commission. For each
    item, write one or more possibilities for what it might refer to.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    anoint the most holy<br>
    <i>Either re-consecrating the rebuilt temple, or annointing Christ (his baptism?)</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">In verse 25 some versions refer to the coming of Messiah, and others refer to
    &quot;The Anointed One. In Hebrew this word is <i>Meshiach</i>, from which we get Messiah.
    Anointing the &quot;most holy&quot; (verse 24, NIV) could be a reference to the Messiah as
    well.</li>
  <li value="1">We will not attempt to dissect the chronology of years here, although this has
    already been done in fms. Go over that section again, including the footnotes to make sure
    you understand it. Since the rebuilding of Jerusalem occurred in the 400&#146;s BC, it
    should be clear that the coming of Messiah is about 483 years from some time in the fifth
    century BC. Without going into detail, this alone should make it clear that the
    fulfillment falls in the early first century. See the works referenced in the notes for
    more detail on the two main ways to interpret the passage.<br>

<p>Chapter 8 Modern Day Predictions</p>
</b></font>

<p>Although the fulfillment of modern day predictions is rarely as objective as those
concerning Christ, there are a few key exceptions.</p>

<p>Read Luke 21:20-25. In this passage Jesus lists a series of events in consecutive
order. Write here the order of events in that passage:<br>
<i><br>
The surrounding and descruction of Jerusalem (AD 70)<br>
The deportation of the Jews into all nations (After AD 70)<br>
The re-occupation of Jerusalem by the Jews (1967)<br>
The end times (?)</i><br>

<ol>
  <li>Compare this prediction to the one in Isaiah 11:1-12. This passage describes the coming
    of Messiah as the Root of Jesse (King David&#146;s father). Isaiah says God will then
    &quot;reach out his hand a second time to reclaim the remnant that is left of his people
    from Assyria, from Lower Egypt, from Upper Egypt, from Cush, from Elam, from Babylonia,
    from Hamath and from the islands of the sea. He will raise a banner for the nations and
    gather the exiles of Israel; he will assemble the scattered people of Judah from the four
    quarters of the earth.&quot; (vs. 11,12) Notice the following about this prediction:<br>
    <i><br>
    This is the second time God regathered Israel. When was the first?<br>
    After the Babylonian captivity in the 6<sup>th</sup> C. BC.</i><br>
    <br>
    He gathers them from a number of nations, including &quot;the islands of the sea.&quot;
    Look in a Bible dictionary or study Bible and record what they say this expression means.<br>
    <br>
    <i>Usually refers to unknown lands beyond the (Mediterranean) Sea</i><br>
    <br>
    He also gathers them from &quot;the four quarters of the Earth.&quot; Would this be a good
    description of the regathering that occurred under Ezra and Nehemaiah? <br>
    <i><br>
    No, they were only regathered from one nation--Babylon</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">Read Ezekiel 37:1-14. According to verse 11, what do the dry bones stand for?<br>
    <br>
    The Nation of Israel, scattered around the earth.<br>
    <br>
    The bones are said to be very dry and dead. What does this suggest about Israel prior to
    the miracle of regathering?<br>
    <br>
    <i>The extreme unlikelihood that they would ever be regathered<br>
    Note too that they are regathered into bodies which nevertheless remain dead. A second
    prophecy is required to raise them to life. This could suggest that Israel is regathered
    in unbelief and later experience a spiritual revival.</i><br>
    <br>
    Read vs. 21-28. Again, from where does God regather his people?<br>
    <br>
    <i>From &quot;all around&quot; but Babylon was only in one direction from Israel</i><br>
    <br>
    According to vs. 24-26, the regathering is associated with certain key events or features.
    List these features here:<br>
    <br>
    &quot;David&quot; apparently refers to the Messiah, son of David.<br>
    Peace in the land&#151;the central Millenial promise.<br>
    <br>
    Can you see any reason why some scholars would associate this regathering with the end
    times?<br>

<p>This chapter is easily the longest in the book, so if you are using this guide for
group study, consider dividing this chapter into more than one week.</p>

<p>Remember that responding to objections to Christianity is not the heart of evangelism.
In fact, we should only answer these common complaints, in my opinion, after we have
already clearly shared the gospel itself. We may find it all too easy to become
side-tracked onto these issues and never actually come to grips with the gospel message of
grace. On the other hand, after we have declared the gospel, we are obligated to give an
account for our belief&#151;that is, to answer honest questions to the best of our
ability. This is why the book has been arranged with the objections at the end.</p>

  <li value="1">Again, when your postmodern friend hears you point out that Christianity and
    other religions contradict one another, she suggests that such contradiction is only on
    the rational level&#151;the level of dogma. What really matters is an experience of the

    <br>
    <i>The David Koresh example speaks to this. Think of others.</i><br>
  </li>
  <li value="1">McCallum says, &quot;Once we are prepared to say any religion is wrong and
    should be rejected, we must be prepared to reject all religion if necessary. Otherwise,
    why would we reject some but not others?&quot; This could be a key insight. If true, it
    means that once our hearers denounce any religion as false, they have crossed a threshold
    where critical issues matter. We can now call on them to be consistent by going the next
    step and re-assessing all religion. How does McCallum attempt to bring people this
    threshold? How will you do so?<br>
    <i><br>
    McCallum cites several of the most extreme and outlandish examples of religion first
    (head-hunting, etc.) and gradually moves to more common religions (Hindu teaching that
    women cannot go to heaven). Note that the rejection of<u> even one extreme religion</u> is
    enough to cross the threshold. Note also, that the rejection of Christianity (even though
    based on its&#146; absolutism) also constitutes crossing the threshold.</i></li>

<p>What about science and Christianity?

<ol>
  </b>
  <li>Many today, under the influence of postmodernism, have come to view science as a
    villainous discipline operated by liars who are more interested in hiding the truth than
    discovering it. Specifically, postmodern people believe science seeks to foist its view on
    others whether right or wrong for them. When dealing with such a person we would waste our
    time if we dwell on harmonizing science and Scripture. How will you tell whether someone

  <li value="1">McCallum says, &quot;We should note first of all that the Bible's world-view

    of cause and effect in a real material world.&quot; What do you think this statement
    means? Is it right, and, if so, what is its significance?<br>
    <i><br>
    Christian thought was the cradle of science. Intellectual historians are convinced that
    science would never have arisen in Hindu or tribal cultures, for instance. This is one
    reason why science has been cast as a villian along with Christianity by postmodern
    thinkers<br>
    Consider this statement by postmodern educator, Roberta Barba: <br>
    &quot;The study of science and related technology often requires students to adapt to a
    white male culture, to an Eurocentric/androcentric world view. The basic assumptions of
    science, as it is taught to American children in textbooks, focus on male as opposed to
    female and on European as opposed to Eastern or African or South American ways of viewing
    the world.&quot; [Robertta Barba, Science in the Multicultural Classroom: A Guide to

<p>What about the existence of evil?

<ol>
  </b>
  <li>Until recently, the problem of evil has been the number one avenue of attack against the
    biblical view of God. This argument still has great influence with some people, though
    more and more people are employing more relativistic defenses. Viewed this way, any
    relativist who throws up the problem of evil is indicating that he or she has run out of
    relativistic formulas and is falling back on older (modernist) methods&#151;a good sign.
    At least such people are using reason and thesis-antithesis thinking in religion. With
    others, this argument occupies the center in their resistance to God. How will you tell
    which kind of person you are dealing with?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li value="1">What bothers you most about the problem of evil and what is your emotional
    reaction?<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Do you think you should share this reaction with a non Christian friend?<br>
    <i><br>
    Probably, failure to admit we feel troubled by this area will be interpreted as coldness
    or smugness on our part.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">Your non Christian friend says, &quot;I can&#146;t believe you would follow a
    god who creates a world where even babies suffer pitifully.&quot; How would you respond?<br>
    <br>
    <i>Encourage members to draw on the approach in fms.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">McCallum claims that personhood requires freedom. Can you think of any other
    illustrations (besides the one with the robot) that show why persons must be free-choosing
    agents?<br>
    <i><br>
    Someone is murdered with a gun. Why do we send the person holding the gun to prison, but
    not the gun itself? The gun is a machine&#151;it does what it is made to do, therefore it
    is not responsible.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">If we reject theism based on the problem of evil, what are the alternative
    explanations? Are these less dreadful or more dreadful than the biblical answer?<br>
  </li>
  <li value="1">McCallum claims there is no fairness in a fallen world. Have you ever wondered
    why a tragedy occurred? Have you ever suspected that you were being punished by God when
    something went wrong? How would you know if a tragedy were disciplinary or merely cause
    and effect?<br>
    <i><br>
    There is not definite answer to this question, which suggests we go easy on the
    theological explanations for tragedy.</i></li>
</ol>
<b>

<p>What about atrocities committed in the name of Christ?

<ol>
  </b>
  <li>Study the section on atrocities and accompanying endnotes. Were you aware that such
    things have occurred? Do you think McCallum may be exaggerating? Would you suggest to
    someone who pointed such incidents out that things might not have been that bad?<br>
    <br>
    <i>This might help identify those who are in the grip of historical denial. The actual
    truth is far worse than McCallum has detailed here. Point out that these are not isolated
    incidents, but a part of the general pattern of church oppression over hundreds of years.
    Other religions are oppressive too, but this is hardly the point.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">McCallum says the rise in church atrocities is linked to the church&#146;s
    move to remove access to Scripture from the laity. Do you agree with his analysis? Why
    would he see this connection? How might popular access to the Bible serve to curb church
    abuse?<br>
    <i><br>
    As church leaders concentrate authority in their own hands, they set the stage to be
    tempted into oppression.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">Do you trust a clergy person to interpret the Bible for you, or do you feel
    responsible to come up with your own interpretation?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<b>

<p>What about hell?

<ol>
  </b>
  <li>Do you think people today are often willing to see God as a God of love but not as a God
    of justice? Why do you suppose this is?<br>
    <i><br>
    The concept of justice is closely related to the concept of truth and of moral right and
    wrong. As these concepts have been overthrown, justice becomes mere personal revenge.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">What bothers you most about hell?<br>
    <i><br>
    Hopefully, thoughtful Christians are troubled by hell. If not, perhaps they have not
    thought deeply about it, or have low empathy. We may be bothered, but we may not deny. We
    should admit we, too, are troubled in this area, but in the end, it&#146;s not up to a
    vote.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">McCallum claims that common grace and general revelation are important
    concepts to consider when dealing with hell. Why?<br>
    <br>
    <i>Justice is only reasonable when people are not compelled to reject God.</li>
  </i>
  <li value="1">Using fms if necessary, describe the views of afterlife held by each of the
    following:<br>
    Atheistic:<br>
    <br>
    Pantheistic<br>
    <br>
    Universalistic<br>
    <br>
    Polytheistic<br>
    <br>
    Biblical<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li value="1">McCallum says, &quot;If we admit free will, we cannot deny
    responsibility.&quot; Why?<br>
    <br>
    See again the illustration of the gun above. </li>
  <li value="1">He also asks, &quot;Is it reasonable to think that I could create a new
    religion with tenets that please me, and feel that because I believe it, it will actually
    be true?&quot; This has become a very important question because postmodern
    constructivists believe exactly that. How would you respond to the notion that &quot;My
    believing something makes it true for me.&quot;<br>
    <br>

<p>Chapter 10 Becoming Involved in Christianity</p>
</b></font>

<p>This final chapter is intended mainly as an invitation to receive Christ and a basic
orientation for those who may have responded to Christ while reading the book. The author
intended to attempt to head people toward biblical fellowship, prayer, and the Bible
itself for growth. As such, we do not feel we need to include it in the study guide.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading fms, and for working through this study guide. We hope God has
used the study to enrich your life and strengthen your faith. Now that you have moved more
deeply into the background issues raised in the book, you should feel more willing than
ever to give it to non Christian friends. May God bless your efforts to spread His word!</p>

      <p><a href="studyguide.doc">Download the study guide as
        a Word document</a></p>
      <p>Use this study guide to discuss <em>Organic Disciplemaking</em> with
        a small group or your personal study partner. First read the chapter,
        either before meeting or together. Then ask the questions, beginning
        with the ones you think are most interesting. When the meeting has lasted
        long enough, you&rsquo;re done! Don&rsquo;t feel like you have to get
      to all the questions.</p>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>1. McCallum and Lowery refer to a shift in the western church toward
        a more organic approach to church life. Do you see this shift in your
        own or other churches you know of? What changes have you seen?</p>
      <p>2. McCallum and Lowery refer to how disciple making has changed in their
        group from a practice carried out by individuals (in the early days)
        to one carried out in the context of community in the body of Christ.
        What advantages could you imagine could result from making disciples
        in community versus by yourself?</p>
      <p>3. Do you feel your church is becoming more, or less interested in discovering
        more organic approaches to ministry? What indications do you see? </p>
      <h2>Chapter 1 Understanding: What is Discipleship?</h2>
      <p>1. McCallum and Lowery cite Barna&rsquo;s claim that few churches in
        America practice personal discipleship. Do you agree that not many American
        Christians practice disciple making? If so, why do you think this has
        happened? Is it unimportant or a serious problem? Why?</p>
      <p>2. Considering that we live in a different culture today, do you agree
        with McCallum and Lowery that the early church should still be viewed
        as a model for us to follow? In what respects? How would you respond
        to someone who argues that the early church may have been no better than
        today&rsquo;s church, and that we have no reason to imitate their practice,
        only their doctrine?</p>
      <p>3. The authors talk about the concept of church planting movements and
        self-replicating cell groups or house churches. They claim that personal
        discipleship is tied a group&rsquo;s ability to multiply. Do you agree
        with this? Why or why not?</p>
      <p>4. McCallum and Lowery refer to a recent study showing that the church
        today is becoming more interested in making disciples than ever before.
        Have you seen any sign of this interest?</p>
      <p>5. McCallum and Lowery claim that churches in the developing world rely
        on disciple making to develop their leadership far more than we do in
        the west. Can you see any reasons why this practice might work there,
        but not in the west?</p>
      <p>6. In a footnote, the authors discuss the contemporary view that personal
        disciple making was obsolete after the time of Jesus. In the New Testament,
        some argue, all Christians are disciples of Christ, and the practice
        of personally discipling people was only practiced before Pentecost.
        McCallum and Lowery take the opposing view that the early church continued
        to rely on personal disciple making to develop leadership. What do you
        think about this debate?</p>
      <h2>Chapter 2 Discipleship Overview</h2>
      <p>1. The authors cite various authorities claiming that most growth in
        western churches is the result of Christian transfers from other churches.
        What do you think about this claim? Is it true, and if so, how should
        we view it?</p>
      <p>2. McCallum and Lowery say, &ldquo;No two disciples are alike. And no
        two disciple makers are alike. Therefore, any attempt to describe the &lsquo;right&rsquo; way
        to make disciples is pointless.&rdquo; Later they say, &ldquo;Although
        disciple making is a creative process, some principles are universal.&rdquo; What
        aspects of disciple making might be universal, and what parts might be
        up to your own creativity?</p>
      <p>3. Appendix 1 contains nine areas where we should look for growth in
        successful disciples. Can you discover any points in that discussion
        that are really not that necessary?</p>
      <p>4. Have you seen group leaders raised up who didn&rsquo;t last long?
        What are some of the common reasons people lose interest or ability to
        carry on as leaders?</p>
      <p>5. What do you see as a more serious need in your community: more leaders
        for home groups or more people willing to attend home groups?</p>
      <p>6. Do you have an opinion about the debate the authors mention between
        views of corporate versus individual disciple making?</p>
      <h2>Chapter 3 Getting Started</h2>
      <p>1. McCallum and Lowery try to make the case that virtually any walking
        Christian is qualified to disciple others. What do you think of this
        position?</p>
      <p>2. Some people are uncomfortable with the idea of selecting some people
        for special treatment in disciple making. How would you answer this sense
        that such partiality is wrong?</p>
      <p>3. McCallum and Lowery argue that having a spiritually hungry heart
        and being a &ldquo;doer&rdquo; are the best things to look for in a prospective
        disciple. Do you agree with this, or would you look for other things
        either in addition to, or instead of these?</p>
      <p>4. What might be some signs that a person has a spiritually hungry heart?</p>
      <p>5. The authors name several features they think are misleading or unimportant
        when choosing a disciple. Would you remove any of these features from
        the list? Or would you add anything?</p>
      <p>6. McCallum and Lowery point out that even the most careful and sacrificial
        disciple maker may fail, even after years of investment in a relationship.
        Considering this possibility, is personal disciple making worth the risk?
        Why or why not?</p>
      <p>7. Assess the authors discussion about developing a vision for your
        disciple. Did this seem realistic? Would you add anything to what they
        said?</p>
      <h2>Chapter 4 Friendship Building</h2>
      <p>1. What do you think about the authors&rsquo; claim that Christian friendships
        need not just happen, but could be deliberately initiated and fostered?
        Do you think this might be unnatural?</p>
      <p>2. McCallum and Lowery think initiating is a key area of sacrifice for
        loving Christians. They seem to imply that if we expect others to initiate
        with us, we are falling short. Do you think their discussion was fair?
        Or should we expect that others would take their turn initiating? </p>
      <p>3. In their section on investing, the authors distinguish between weaknesses
        and points of resistance. Do you think this distinction is important?
        Why or why not?</p>
      <p>4. The authors say, &ldquo;Patience and grace are very important when
        dealing with a disciple&rsquo;s weaknesses.&rdquo; What are some thoughts
        or reflections that would help you be more patient and gracious with
        a weak disciple?</p>
      <p>5. This chapter puts emphasis on thinking and praying about your friends
        when you aren&rsquo;t with them. How important has this been in your
        experience, and how important should it be?</p>
      <p>6. If you were advising a friend who has trouble building friendships,
        what would you say? Without trying to map everything out, throw out some
        thoughts that might be helpful.</p>
      <h2>Chapter 5 Modeling</h2>
      <p>1. Think of someone you have considered a model. What features made
        you feel he or she was credible and worthy of being imitated?</p>
      <p>2. Many Christians, and maybe most, would say that Jesus is number one
        in their lives. Yet, sometimes we find ourselves doubting whether this
        is really true. While we have to be cautious about reading another&rsquo;s
        heart, what are some things that raise these kind of questions?</p>
      <p>3. The authors think being honest is good for credibility as a model,
        while dishonesty is deadly. How honest do you think a disciple maker
        should be? If you have a fairly serious area of besetting sin, how much
        do you think you should say to your disciple?</p>
      <p>4. McCallum and Lowery say that things like encouragement, empathy,
        and careful listening can best be transmitted through modeling. Describe
        some situations where someone might be able to observe and imitate these
        relational skills. Can you think of a time when you gained insight or
        inspiration while watching a mature Christian using one of these skills?</p>
      <p>5. The authors suggest that forgiveness is important in learning to
        love others. What do you think is important in learning how to forgive
        from the heart?</p>
      <p>6. Victorious suffering is an ability people might gain through a combination
        of modeling and instruction, according to McCallum and Lowery. If you
        had a friend who was suffering, what are some points you might make to
        help them gain victory?</p>
      <p>7. When discussing whether people are qualified to be models, the authors
        say, &ldquo;your value as a model is relative&rdquo; (p. 104). What do
        you think they meant by this? Is this suggestion right? Is it helpful?
        In what sense is your value relative?</p>
      <h2>Chapter 6 The Bible</h2>
      <p>1. In the context of meeting with a disciple, McCallum and Lowery ask, &ldquo;Is
        studying the Bible essential?&rdquo; What do you think? Would it be always,
        usually, sometimes, or not really necessary? What kind of situations
        might call for different approaches?</p>
      <p>2. Some people feel uncomfortable making the transition from just being
        friends, to sitting down to study together. What are some suggestions
        for ways to make this transition?</p>
      <p>3. In Appendix 2 (available on the website &ndash; <a href="index.htm">www.xenos.org/discipleship</a>)
        the authors provide an outline teaching that the Bible is inspired right
        down to the words and even non-theological material, like historical
        events. How important do you think this is? Would it be okay if only
        the main ideas are inspired? Must we argue this position? Justify your
        answer.</p>
      <p>4. Christians in America debate today whether we should develop theological
        outlines that reflect &ldquo;the Bible&rsquo;s teaching on an issue&rdquo; or
        just read individual stories or passages without trying to harmonize
        them with other statements in different books. What do you think?</p>
      <p>5. Name some areas of biblical competence you would like to see in your
        disciple by the time you finish.</p>
      <p>6. McCallum and Lowery suggest that learning a truth or a passage is
        one thing, but being able to explain it to others requires a higher level
        of understanding. Why do they say this? What is different between knowing
        something for yourself and explaining it to others?</p>
      <p>7. How long do you think it would take for a new Christian to gain basic
        competence in the Bible?</p>
      <h2>Chapter 7 Prayer I: Getting Started</h2>
      <p>1. Can you remember when you, or a newly Christian friend became comfortable
        praying in a group? What were some things that helped?</p>
      <p>2. McCallum and Lowery quote Jesus as saying, &ldquo;I will do whatever
        you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father.&rdquo; They
        go on to suggest that praying in his name roughly means praying according
        to his will. Do you agree with this view? If you do agree, what are some
        important things we know are his will?</p>
      <p>3. This chapter discusses helping disciples develop &ldquo;the habit
        of a daily appointment with God.&rdquo; How important do you think this
        is? Do you think most Christians practice this?</p>
      <p>4. The authors discuss the story of the ten lepers, arguing that the
        nine ungrateful lepers is too often a picture of us. What are some of
        the main reasons we are so often ungrateful?</p>
      <p>5. Do you agree that giving thanks to God has a noticeable effect on
        your spiritual life? What are some of these effects?</p>
      <h2>Chapter 8 Prayer II: Ministry and Prayer</h2>
      <p>1. McCallum and Lowery point out that Paul&rsquo;s prayers are usually
        for others. Even when he asks for prayer for himself, it&rsquo;s usually
        that he will be effective in serving others. They think we all should
        increasingly notice this pattern in our own lives. &ldquo;When viewing
        ourselves in Christ, our concerns for self decline, while our concern
        for others takes center stage.&rdquo; (p. 132) Do you agree, or is this
        pattern mainly tied to Paul&rsquo;s calling as an apostle?</p>
      <p>2. What is the role of prayer in ministry? What kind of things can we
        do through prayer, and are there any limits?</p>
      <p>3. What would probably be the marks of a relatively prayerless ministry?</p>
      <p>4. In their discussion of &ldquo;exploratory prayer&rdquo; the authors
        suggest that we should listen for God to speak. But some Christians find
        it difficult to determine if God is speaking to them. What would be your
        advice for distinguishing between my own feelings and what God is saying?</p>
      <p>5. McCallum and Lowery picture spiritual warfare as mainly a struggle
        between believing Satan&rsquo;s lies and God&rsquo;s truth. Do you think
        this picture is adequate, or should more be added?</p>
      <h2>Chapter 9 Counseling</h2>
      <p><i>[We suggest you visit the Organic Disciplemaking website and look
          through the supplemental material for the chapter on counseling. Those
          articles will help you lead a better discussion on these issues.]</i></p>
      <p>1. What have you noticed about the interplay between psychology and
        Christianity? Should any aspects of contemporary psychology be questioned
        by Christians?</p>
      <p>2. The authors quote Larry Crabb as saying:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> &quot;We have produced a generation of therapists, an army of counselors
          trained to do battle with problems they poorly understand because they
          have spent more time in classrooms becoming experts than in God&rsquo;s
          presence becoming elders. We have lost interest in developing mentors,
          wise men and women who know how to get to the real core of things and
          who have the power to bring supernatural resources to bear on what&rsquo;s
          wrong.&quot;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>How would you react to this comment?</p>
      <p>3. Interpersonal conflict can devastate relationships and whole churches.
        What are some of the most important things for Christians to do when
        they find themselves or their friends in conflict?</p>
      <p>4. In their section on self-absorption, McCallum and Lowery seem to
        think that sitting around thinking about yourself might be harmful if
        we do it too much. What might be the signs that we are becoming self-absorbed?</p>
      <p>5. On high-expectation relating: Is it wrong to expect your friends
        or family to do their part in a relationship? What does the Bible say
        about this?</p>
      <p>6. Biblical sexual ethics and our culture&rsquo;s beliefs about sex
        diverge widely. As Christian communicators, how should we handle this
        widening gap?</p>
      <p>7. Is a disciple maker really in a position to help a married couple
        in their communication? What kind of things could you ask, say, or do
        to help another&rsquo;s marriage?</p>
      <p>8. McCallum and Lowery say, &ldquo;In our opinion, materialistic greed
        is the greatest enemy of spirituality in the American church.&rdquo; What
        do you think about this statement?</p>
      <p>9. If someone sets out on a plan to become wealthy, do you think it
        would be a sin? Does the Bible speak to this? <i>[Visit the Organic Disciplemaking
        website for ideas]</i></p>
      <p>10.&nbsp; When discussing helping Christians with morally bad habits,
        McCallum and Lowery say, &ldquo;First, we will probably never reach a
        point where our disciple has no sin habits. We are forced to work for
        relative freedom, not perfection.&rdquo; Why do you think they make this
        point?</p>
      <p>11.&nbsp; The authors think honesty is key in overcoming bad habits.
        What do you think? Do you believe your Christian community is honest
        about their sin problems?</p>
      <h2>Chapter 10 Encountering Lack of Progress:<br>
        Discerning What to Do</h2>
      <p>1. McCallum says, &ldquo;Too many disciple makers are squeamish about
        pulling the trigger when it comes to making an unambiguous, direct call
        for action.&rdquo; Have you seen this? Or should disciple makers assume
        God will move people to act in his own time?</p>
      <p>2. Do you agree that, &ldquo;soft disciplers consistently see very poor
        results in discipleship?&rdquo; Or are bossy disciplemakers even worse?
        What might be signs that a disciplemaker is being too soft or too bossy?</p>
      <p>3. The authors distinguish between points of resistance and &ldquo;dissonance.&rdquo; Dissonance
        is when young believers begin to second-guess their decision to come
        to Christ. What some good things to do when a new Christian experiences
        dissonance?</p>
      <p>4. McCallum and Lowery mention one option when facing a disciple with
        a point of resistance: &ldquo;looking the other way.&rdquo; Wouldn&rsquo;t
        deliberately ignoring such a sin problem be compromise with sin? Or can
        you see a basis for such a course?</p>
      <p>5. Many people are uncomfortable with Jesus&rsquo; whipping people in
        the temple. Can such an action be justified? What does this incident
        say about Jesus and God?</p>
      <p>6. What are some differences between the concept of discipline for children
        versus adults?</p>
      <p>7. The authors suggest that some sins are more serious than others.
        Does the Bible back this suggestion, and if so, what makes some sins
        more serious than others?</p>
      <h2>Chapter 11 Encountering Lack of Progress:<br>
        Practicing Discipline in Love</h2>
      <p>1. Some Christian communities don&rsquo;t believe in practicing reproofs,
        rebukes, or other disciplinary actions. What would be some arguments
        for, or against the practice of discipline?</p>
      <p>2. McCallum and Lowery describe imaginary problem categories: &ldquo;significant,
        but not serious&rdquo; &ldquo;serious, but not spiritually life threatening&rdquo; and &ldquo;spiritually
        life threatening, or menacing to others.&rdquo; Can you describe problems
        that would fit each category?</p>
      <p>3. What do you think would happen if a local church allows members to
        fornicate?</p>
      <p>4. Have you ever been involved in disciplining a fellow Christian? Without
        disclosing confidential material, describe what happened, and how you
        feel about it today.</p>
      <p>5. The authors suggest we need to raise a sense of tension in our relationship
        with a believer who is resistant to God. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better
        to just show nurture and love, and let God work on the person&rsquo;s
        heart in his own time? What biblical evidence can be marshaled for each
        option?</p>
      <h2>Chapter 12 Coaching: Early Ministry Development</h2>
      <p>1. Do you agree that ministry is just as much a means of growth as prayer?</p>
      <p>2. What happens when in the lives of Christians who fail to develop
        ministry? What about a group where people don&rsquo;t see this need?</p>
      <p>3. What are some of the keys you&rsquo;ve seen to stimulating others
        to try evangelism?</p>
      <p>4. Do people in your home group have a burden for ministry? What could
        you do to increase people&rsquo;s burden to serve?</p>
      <p>5. McCallum and Lowery say, &ldquo;Without consistent effort at evangelism,
        disciple making becomes a turning inward that will not result in authentic
        growth.&rdquo; Is this over-stated? Or do you agree? Why?</p>
      <p>6. Have you ever tried to share your faith, only to have the person
        react with hostility? What would you say a new Christian who is startled
        by such hostility?</p>
      <p>7. How much difference do you think it makes when people regularly pray
        for opportunities to witness or build up other believers? Can you think
        of cases where this has mattered to you?</p>
      <h2>Chapter 13 Coaching: Moving Toward Independence</h2>
      <p>1. Talk about possessiveness in ministry. What causes people to be possessive?
        What is the best antidote?</p>
      <p>2. Succeeding in developing multi-level discipleship (where your disciples
        have their own disciples) is the ultimate goal in discipleship. If you
        reached this goal, what steps could you take to keep it going and advancing?</p>
      <p>3. McCallum and Lowery suggest that we should prioritize seeking change
        in some sin areas more than in others. What do you think about that idea?
        Is it valid? If it were, how would someone choose which sin areas to
        prioritize?</p>
      <p>4. The authors think we should teach disciples to be &ldquo;proactive&rdquo; rather
        than &ldquo;reactive&rdquo; in ministry. What would be some examples
        of proactive vs. reactive ministry? What might be the effect on your
        ministry if you are reactive or proactive.</p>
      <p>5. Have you ever tried to work with a person who didn&rsquo;t progress
        like you hoped? What kind of things are most helpful in dealing with
        cases like these?</p>
      <p>6. Do you see any possible problems with the idea of setting goals in
        ministry? What might be some benefits? Is pursuing goals biblical?</p>
      <p>7. McCallum and Lowery say that persuasion is a key skill for good coaches.
        What kind of things do you think makes someone persuasive?</p>
      <h2>Chapter 14 Coaching Group Leadership</h2>
      <p>1. McCallum and Lowery discuss learning how to assemble and nurture
        a team of co-workers in Christian groups. What skills and practices have
        you seen as helpful in bringing together unified, motivated teams?</p>
      <p>2. Some people are reluctant to delegate. Others are too eager. What
        do you think are the causes and perils of each extreme?</p>
      <p>3. McCallum and Lowery think almost anyone can lead a discussion if
        they are trained. What do you think are some key skills leaders of discussion
        need to develop?</p>
      <p>4. The last section of this chapter is on encouragement. How purposeful
        and planned-out do you think people should be when it comes to encouraging
        others?</p>
      <p>5. Are group leaders pretty much on their own, or do you think coaching
        from outside the group would really make a difference? What should coaches
        try to do for group leaders?</p>
      <h2>Chapter 15 Releasing: Preparation</h2>
      <p>1. McCallum and Lowery think that before we can safely release disciples,
        they need to believe in a deep way in God&rsquo;s part in ministry. What
        difference do you think this would make in different areas of ministry
        like prayer, witnessing, teaching or leading discussion, counseling,
        admonishing, or discipleship?</p>
      <p>2. McCallum and Lowery spend quite a bit of time in this chapter discussing
        the theology of failure. do you think we need to fail, or is it just
        something we should learn to withstand. If you have ever failed, what
        effect did it have on you?</p>
      <p>3. Have you ever experienced an unstable leader, or one lacking integrity?
        What has been the effect on their ministry? How can we enhance stability
        and integrity in our upcoming leaders?</p>
      <p>4. McCallum and Lowery think compromise is often a good quality in leaders.
        But other authors talk about the need to avoid compromise. In what sense
        might compromise be good, and in what sense bad?</p>
      <h2>Chapter 16 Releasing: The Transition</h2>
      <p>1. Can you imagine possible problems that could come up in connection
        with releasing a disciple? What would these be, and how could you respond?</p>
      <p>2. Have you ever seen someone who remained well-motivated until a certain
        leader was no longer around? What might cause people to lose motivation
        just because a certain motivator is no longer available?</p>
      <p>3. McCallum and Lowery say, &ldquo;This period after releasing a disciple
        is when we find out how well we did as disciple makers.&rdquo; What kind
        of things would you look at to make this determination?</p>
      <h2>Chapter 17 Leading Disciple Makers</h2>
      <p>1. Would you be interested in participating in a gathering of disciple
        makers? Why, or why not?</p>
      <p>2. McCallum suggests beginning a disciple-maker&rsquo;s group even if
        you have as few as three or four. What would you do if you were leading
        such a gathering?</p>
      <p>3. McCallum describes a situation in their church where hundreds of
        people work at making disciples. Do you think his is a special situation,
        or could this happen in any church?</p>
      <p>4. How do you feel about the idea of reporting on ministry results in
        groups? Isn&rsquo;t this focusing on the wrong thing? Or is there biblical
        warrant for it?</p>
      <p>5. McCallum discusses &ldquo;developing a sense of team&rdquo; among
        the disciple makers in your church. What kind of things might make you
        feel this sense?</p>
      <p>6. Do you see any possible dangers in publicly recognizing disciple
        makers? Or does this seem like a good idea?</p>

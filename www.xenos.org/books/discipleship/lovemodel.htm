      <h2><em>A Biblical Model
        for Love Relationships</em></h2>
      <p><a href="../../personal/den.htm">By Dennis McCallum</a><br>
        <i>This</i><i> model is loosely based on my notes from an approach to
        relationship taught in the 1970's by psychiatrist and former missionary,
        Dr. Ralph Ankenman. His approach has never been published to my knowledge,
      and I may have changed his material quite a bit at points.</i></p>
      <h3>Description  </h3>
      <p>The key to success in one's emotional life is expressing victorious,
        mature love <i>output</i>, rather than getting love <i>input </i>from
        others. In other words, no matter how those around us behave or treat
        us, we are always able to express love, and in non-clinical cases this
        should eventually result in improved emotional health. In this paper,
        we look for a biblical definition of love at its best. </p>
      <h3>Biblical Love Defined</h3>
      <p>As we argued in Organic Disciple Making, the biblical ideal of Christian
      love could be defined as:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><i>"<strong>A</strong><strong> commitment to, with God's power, give of
          myself in every area for the good of another.</strong></i>"</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>While the general idea of caring about another, and seeking ways to
        give of myself for that person's well being is simple enough, we should
        also carefully consider four specific aspects mentioned in scripture
        as characterizing mature love relationships. To express biblical love
        at the highest level, these four aspects should all be present and balanced.
        The four aspects are: </p>
      <table border="1" align="center" cellpadding="10">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td valign="top" width="50%"><p><strong>Sacrificial</strong></p></td>
            <td valign="top" width="50%"><p><strong>Forgiving</strong></p></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td valign="top" width="50%"><p><strong>Emotional</strong></p></td>
            <td valign="top" width="50%"><p><strong>Disciplining</strong></p></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>We will examine each of these aspects in turn. Most people tend to have
        weaknesses in certain aspects more than others. But by creating strategies
        for change, you can help people strengthen their weak areas. As you read,
        consider whether your disciple might need work on any one of these aspects. </p>
      <h4>The Sacrificial Aspect</h4>
      <p>The <i>sacrificial</i> aspect of love is based on passages such as Mark&nbsp;10:45
        where Christ explains that, "The Son of man did not come to be served
        but to serve." Here, positive servitude is seen as the example of Christ&mdash;complete
        willingness to give of one's self for the good of another. In John&nbsp;15
        Jesus says, "Greater love has no man than that he lay down his life for
        his friends." We see that Christ did live this way. But we must also
        see that he commanded believers to "love one another as I have loved
        you" (John&nbsp;15:12; 13:34).</p>
      <p>Such servitude does not require that the other person even request help. <i>Initiative</i> in
        serving is an important component of Christ-like love because, although "no
        one seeks for God," we find that, "while we were still powerless, Christ
        died for the ungodly." (Rom.&nbsp;5:6) Put differently in I&nbsp;Jn.&nbsp;4:19, "We
        love because he first loved us." This means that the idea of positive
        servitude is an active, rather than a passive concept. The lover is not <i>responding</i> to
        love demands, he/she is <i>seeking</i> ways to serve and meet needs.
        Initiating love is part of our sacrifice.</p>
      <p>Sacrificial initiative also means that biblical lovers won't complain
        that, "no one has called me on the phone," or that, "It's always
        me who has to do the asking," etc. To the Christ-like lover, initiative
        is always viewed as an opportunity, not as a burden. The creativity and
        work needed to come up with new ways to initiate love giving are part
        of the sacrifice of love.</p>
      <p>Self-sacrifice means that I have waived all personal rights within a
        relationship. Christ certainly had basic human rights such as justice
        and equality. Yet these were voluntarily waived when he allowed himself
        to be crucified while innocent. We do not find Christ complaining that "It
        isn't fair" as the nails are driven into his hands. Mature Christ-like
        love, then, rejects the idea that "I have a right to be treated in such-and-such
        a way," and instead, has not only accepted the unfairness of life, but
        sees self-sacrifice as more important than fairness.</p>
      <p>Fairness is still a useful concept to mature lovers, because some relationships
        should be governed by fairness rather than self-sacrifice. Examples might
        include business dealings, crime and punishment, and a just war. Most
        of these relationships are not love relationships, and deal more with
        social ethics (for government or institutions) than with individual ethics
        (for personal relationships).</p>
      <p>Self-sacrificial servanthood is probably the most central theme in biblical
        ethics. When viewed from this perspective, we see that biblical love
        is not primarily a feeling of affection for another, although it is certainly
        compatible with affection. Instead, love is primarily the action of serving
        another (see John's definition of love in I&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:17, where
        love is seen less as a feeling and more as an action). Such serving action
        can be rendered whether feelings of direct affection are present at the
        moment or not! Because giving love is a matter of willing commitment
        rather than the presence of a feeling, our definition of love begins
        with the phrase "commitment to give of one's self.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.."</p>
      <h4>The Forgiving Aspect of Love</h4>
      <p>Another implication of the imitation of Christ is the idea of <i>forgiveness</i>.
        Jesus emphasized the need to forgive others (Mt.&nbsp;6:14,15; 18:21-35).
        Therefore, bitterness, remembering of wrongs and retributive acts are
        excluded from our understanding of authentic biblical love (I&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;13:5;
        Eph.&nbsp;4:32).</p>
      <p>God's insistence that we forgive others is based on the fact that he
        has forgiven us, and just as his forgiveness covers all sin, our forgiveness
        has to be complete and without exception (Col. 3:13 "Bear with each other
        and forgive <i>whatever grievances you may have</i> against one another.
        Forgive as the Lord forgave you."). Therefore, Christians who relate
        to God on the basis of his forgiveness, while at the same time insisting
        on the right to refuse forgiveness to others, are fundamentally hypocritical.
        Stated positively, the recognition of our own sins and the depth of God's
        forgiveness provides motivation to voluntarily forgive others.</p>
      <p>Unresolved anger and resentments involving current or past wrongs can
        be highly disruptive to relationships. Resentment and hate are terrifically
        draining emotionally, and these are sure to follow when we fail to forgive
        from the heart. The depression and hostility resulting from lack of forgiveness
        can manifest itself in other relationships as well as in our functional
        lives, rendering us unable to complete demanding tasks and reducing our
        reliability. We should also be clear that failure to forgive, and the
        resulting bitterness and resentment are all sin, according to the Bible.</p>
      <h4>The Disciplining Aspect of Love</h4>
      <p>However, forgiveness does not imply passivity in the face of evil. Practicing
        Discipline is also an important aspect of biblical love. According to
        many passages, real love includes the responsibility to discipline, admonish,
        rebuke, or oppose others <i>for their own good</i> (Mt. 18:11-14; Rom.&nbsp;16:17;
        I&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;5:5-7; II&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;7:8-12; Gal.&nbsp;6:1; Col.&nbsp;1:28;
        3:16; I&nbsp;Thess.&nbsp;5:14; II&nbsp;Thess.&nbsp;3:6,14; I&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;5:1,2;
        II&nbsp;Tim. 2:24-26; 3:16,17 Titus&nbsp;1:13; Heb. 12:5-12; III&nbsp;Jn.&nbsp;9,10;
        etc.). When dealing with Christians, we should be guided in the application
        of discipline by the desire and goal of seeing other's conformed to the
        image of Christ. Christians are also called to grow up to "the fullness
        of the stature of Christ" (Rom.&nbsp;8:29; Eph.&nbsp;13-15). When dealing
        with non Christians, we still have a basis for discipline, mainly focusing
        on general principles of relating which we can negotiate with others
        for the common good.</p>
      <p>Discipline in love must be carefully differentiated from any principle
        of justice or fairness. The point in discipline in love is not to punish
        fairly for wrong-doing, but to help the other person change for the better.
        Therefore, the believer is free to be "unfair" in the sense that more
        grace may be shown than would be warranted by the other's attitude or
        actions. Likewise, different people can be treated differently even though
        their actions are identical. When practicing discipline in love, our
        focus is toward the future (seeking redemptive change), whereas the focus
        of justice is on the past (matching the punishment to the crime).</p>
      <p>Discipline in love is never the product of an angry loss of self-control.
        Discipline is a carefully measured response to observed behavior or attitudes.
        Anger may be incorporated into a disciplinary discussion for the sake
        of emphasis. However, such anger would be an "anger without sin" (Eph.&nbsp;4:26)
        because it is not a selfish reaction to the violation of one's personal
        rights. Like Jesus, who demonstrated anger when cleansing the temple,
        we may realize that some people will listen only when we demonstrate
        a certain level of indignation.</p>
      <p>In our earlier definition of love, the disciplinary aspect can be seen
        in the phrase, "for another's good" rather than simply, "for another." This
        is because what another wants and what that person needs may be completely
        different.</p>
      <h4>The Emotional Aspect of Love</h4>
      <p>The <i>emotional</i> needs of other people are important as well as
        their practical needs. Therefore, true biblical love is committed to
        meeting legitimate emotional needs when possible and appropriate. If
        we serve others in a cold and unfeeling way, we are loving sub-biblically.
        The examples of Christ, who wept for the sheep of Israel who had no shepherd,
        and who wept at Lazarus' tomb, as well as the many examples of nurturing
        emotion found in the writings of Paul both demonstrate the importance
        of emotional encouragement, disclosure, empathy and compassion. Scripture
        calls on believers to be "kind and tender-hearted" and to speak words
        that edify (Eph. 4:29,32).</p>
      <p>According to the biblical picture of love, our focus is not merely on
        trying to constantly feel strong sensations of affection, sorrow, or
        ecstasy for another. Rather, our focus is on <i>expressing </i>these
        emotions based on the truth. Thus, emotional expression can and should
        go beyond the immediate feeling of the one expressing it. The larger
        context of the relationship may dictate that I express affection and
        care, even when I do not feel spontaneously compelled to do so. Such
        expression would not be manipulation or dishonesty, because what I express
        is actually true, and because I am expressing it in order to give, not
        to take. In fact, expressing nurturing emotion often more truly reflects
        the truth about a relationship than would a lack of such expression.</p>
      <p>In theory, as we learn to express emotions, the present <i>experience</i> of
        those feelings becomes more frequent and real. As in other areas life,
        believers can find their feelings coming into line with what they know
        to be true. The emotional aspect of giving in love is expressed in our
        earlier definition by the phrase, ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.in every area.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.." This
        phrase is important for those who would give in other areas, but who
        would not easily give emotionally.</p>
      <p>Those who are already strongly emotional may need to consider how they
        express emotions as well. Negative emotional expressions should be controlled.
        If we feel justified in "venting" our feelings, even though they are
        unedifying or even destructive to others, we are practicing a selfish
        form of love alien to the Bible. Likewise, if we demand that others express
        certain emotions in certain ways we violate the concept of sacrificial
        love mentioned above. These are love demands, which are antithetical
        to the notion of self-giving.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, we might find it appropriate to take loved ones to
        task for their lack of emotional expression, but only if such confrontation
        is for his own good. Anyone who cannot express caring emotion has a problem
        with will inhibit relationships. Therefore as seen earlier, we may be
        moved by the principle of discipline in love to approach others with
        their need to change lest their own relationship (perhaps including the
        ones with us) suffer.</p>
      <h3>Deficiency patterns in love:  "Love Spheres"-- Who We Love</h3>
      <p>When helping people to relate maturely, we can refer to "love spheres." Love
        spheres refer to our patterns of choices regarding <i>whom</i> to love.
        Two terms are used to describe this area: the Tribal love sphere, and
        the Diffuse love sphere.</p>
      <h4>The Tribal Love Sphere</h4>
      <p>Some people form relatively few relationships and remain in those relationships
        as long as possible, even if they are destructive. Such people usually
        selfishly cling to old relationships because they find the process of
        building new relationships burdensome or even frightening. In extreme
        (though not unusual) cases, some people's circle of relationships is
        no larger than the nuclear family.</p>
      <p>This type of relational pattern is could be called <i>tribalistic</i>.
        The term tribalistic comes from oral cultures where members of other
        tribes are often viewed as sub-human. Tribes commonly use the same word
        for both the name of their tribe and for "human being." When people look
        at the world this way, they have little interest in relating to members
        of other tribes on a personal level. Relationships with outsiders are
        usually limited to a very superficial level involving business or diplomacy.</p>
      <p>Many Westerners demonstrate the same mentality, defining their family
        as their "tribe." Relationships with those outside the tribe are neither
        sought nor welcomed, except on a very superficial level. People outside
        the tribe are treated virtually like symbols rather than actual people.
        Meanwhile, relationships within the tribe are expected to completely
        meet all relational needs. Such expectations are really love demands,
        and other family members may feel burdened and suffocated because they
        can never fulfill such demands.</p>
      <p>When tribalistic people need to form new relationships (perhaps because
        one's tribe is gone), this presents a serious problem. Overly tribalistic
        people will have difficulty forming new relationships, reaching out to
        the lost with God's love, using their gifts in ministry, and valuing
        people outside the tribe.</p>
      <p>When we try to help people relate maturely, we realize some people naturally
        lean toward a tribalistic pattern of relating. Strangely, we observe
        that narrowness in relational life is often connected to a general narrowness
        or rigidity in most areas of life. Tribalism in non-relational areas
        of life is called "functional tribalism." The functionally tribalistic
        person derives a sense of security from "sameness." Even though the status
        quo may not be particularly satisfying, it's better than changing
        to something new. Therefore, tribalistic people tend to live with a great
        deal of routine in their lives. The same schedule every week and every
        day will tend to be comforting to the tribalistic person, while not knowing
        what is going to happen next causes anxiety. The diffuse person (see
        below) would feel trapped by the same routine that makes tribal people
        feel secure. For functionally tribal people, messiness is very disturbing,
        while a diffuse person often has no problem with messiness. This characteristic
        rigidity may extend into all areas of life, reflecting a desire for <i>structure
        and predictability</i>. The tribalist's insistence on a strict
        routine may interfere with the need to adapt to new conditions at work
        or elsewhere. In extreme cases, the tribalist may eventually lose the
        ability to function in any but one way.</p>
      <p>This desire for predictability may lead to a form of relating based
        on controlling loved ones. The tribal person may interpret another's
        submission to their control as love. Yet, as the love feelings resulting
        from control of, let's say, the other's schedule wears off,
        the tribal lover feels the need to exert further control in other areas
        just to keep up the same feelings. Those who love tribalists may end
        up jumping through incredible hoops to avoid punishment.</p>
      <p>In marriage, this desire for control may also result in a variety of
        sexual dysfunctions. These could range from the need to have sex in only
        one way, to complete frigidity or impotence when the person feels unable
        to enter into an intimate, yet uncontrollable situation requiring improvisation
        and vulnerability. Paradoxically, some tribalists may come to interpret
        their spouses agreeing to sex as submitting to control. They then may
        begin to constantly demand sex as a sign of love.</p>
      <p>Control is a key word for understanding the tribalistic love sphere.
        Extreme tribalists often develop control-related neuroses. Various phobic
        complexes can result from the inability of the tribalist to control some
        aspects of the environment. Anxiety can come to play an increasing role
        as the tribalist worries that he/she may lose control of the situation
        or of the future.</p>
      <p>Family members who realize that they are expected to meet all of the
        tribalist's needs often feel repelled. Ironically, tribalists often
        end up with quite alienated relationships even within their own tribe.
        The in-grown environment breeds relational ill-health, in-fighting, and
        simmering resentments. Hysterical episodes sometimes afflict extreme
        tribalists who feel they are losing control.</p>
      <h4>The Diffuse Love Sphere</h4>
      <p>The diffuse person is the opposite of the tribalistic. Diffuse people
        demonstrate a tendency to become quickly involved in a new relationship,
        and to immediately feel "close." However, they typically fail to invest
        sufficiently in the relationship especially after the initial enthusiasm
        wears off. Relationships tend to become "boring." As relational problems
        arise, the diffuse person often finds it easier to form a relationship
        with someone else than to resolve problems in existing relationships.
        Of course, even tribalistic people may decide to form new relationships
        in some cases, but the diffuse do so much more often. The result is usually
        a series of superficial relationships. In extreme cases, diffuse people
        may never actually form any relationships at all. They may simply meet
        people and interact on a sub-relational level, seeking stimulation which
        they interpret as love.</p>
      <p>Just as the tribalistic individual desires structure and control in
        life, the diffuse person desires <i>stimulation</i> and <i>freedom</i>.
        Lack of stimulation leads to boredom, restlessness and often resentment
        toward loved ones. Diffuse people may find stimulation in either the
        functional area (video games or job changes) or in the relational area
        (moving from one romance to another).</p>
      <h3>Present Love Feelings vs.
        Permanent Love Values</h3>
      <p>When working with people to achieve balance and maturity in their relational
        lives, we may refer to the stimulation sought by diffuse people as "present
        love feelings." Diffuse people falsely believe that the cravings within,
        such as the need for drug intoxication or public acclaim, will lead to
        happiness. But we know that they really long for present love feelings--the
        present sense of being loved. Present love feelings are evident when
        teenagers "fall in love." Such feelings are tangible sensations of excitement
        which generally cannot be maintained over a long period of time. To the
        diffuse person, present love feelings <i>are</i> love. Anything else
        is an unsatisfying imitation of the real thing. </p>
      <p>Tribalistic people appreciate a different type of love feeling referred
        to as "permanent love values." The sense of security and relaxation that
        some people feel when sitting around their parent's or their own house
        in a familiar chair, with family members around them, are examples of
        permanent love values. Although we experience little sense of excitement
        associated with such love values, and often little overt emotional response
        at all, tribalistic people find such situations very attractive.</p>
      <p>As diffuse people pursue present love feelings, they may develop assorted
        emotional disorders. Typical types of disorders are drug addiction, alcoholism,
        obesity, and inability to succeed at a job, finish school or complete
        other complex tasks. This is because the failure to build deep relationships
        results in a sense of boredom, emptiness. or void which demands solution.
        The diffuse person typically reacts to such feelings by seeking stimulation.
        The particular type of stimulation sought may vary, but any satisfaction
        derived thereby will be only temporary. Diffuse people who turn to intoxicants
        for stimulation will take more and more in an effort to achieve the same
        temporary level of excitement, often resulting in addiction.</p>
      <p>In marriage, a diffuse people may refuse to invest in a relationship
        now considered "old hat." Diffuse spouses may struggle with constant
        feelings of dissatisfaction in the marital sexual relationship because
        it isn't as stimulating as other immoral relationships, or even
        as the married relationship was at the beginning. Divorce is very common
        among diffuse people for the obvious reason that their spouses are dissatisfied
        with the level of involvement in the marriage, and/or the diffuse one
        becomes convinced that another person would be more rewarding than the
        present spouse. Diffuse people are prime candidates for adultery. Their
        spouses often complain that they are never home.</p>
      <h4>Balanced Love Spheres</h4>
      <p>When helping people learn how to love maturely, our goal in the area
        of love spheres is neither to eliminate tribalistic or diffuse tendencies,
        but to achieve a relative <i>balance</i> between them. A mature biblical
        lover should be able to build deeply within a tribal framework, while
        retaining both the ability and the desire to establish new relationships
        and care for those outside the tribe.</p>
      <p>The scriptural mandate for such a balance is clear. Jesus critiques
        extreme tribalists in Matthew&nbsp;5:46, where he rejects the idea of "loving
        only them that love you." This is sub-biblical selfishness because it
        ignores the needs of those outside one's family or affinity group. Likewise,
        the Pharisees' attempt to evade responsibility to love outsiders was
        rebuked by the example of the good Samaritan (Luke&nbsp;10:25-37). All
        of the passages that call for outreach to the lost (cf. Matthew 28:19)
        are also, by implication, against excessive tribalism.</p>
      <p>Excessive diffuseness would be antithetical to the biblical call for
        deep love relationships, such as Eph.&nbsp;5:25-29. The principle of "remaining
        in that condition in which you were called,"(I&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;7:20) is
        antithetical to excessive diffuseness also. Stimulation is a poor substitute
        for real love.</p>
      <p>Balance can be enhanced by two means: 1) Learning to appreciate the
        missing love sphere, and 2) Recognizing and limiting excesses in the
        preferred love sphere. We will consider practical ideas for both of these
        later.</p>
      <p>When dealing with love spheres, we may encounter a confusing twist,
        especially with men. Some people are functionally tribalistic, and relationally
        diffuse. Others are relationally tribalistic, and functionally diffuse
        (although this is more rare). In the first case, the man will be a rigid,
        dominating family man, but also may have an occasional affair with his
        secretary. The functionally diffuse will have no interest in new relationships,
        but continually begins new hobbies, sports, or maintain a gambling habit
        for stimulation.</p>
      <p>Some people are already relatively balanced in the area of love spheres.
        These people's problems are likely in other areas, such as failure
        to give in all areas, or failure to forgive or discipline.</p>
      <h3>Applying the concepts in this model</h3>
      <p>When trying to help people grow in true, biblical love we usually follow
        a progression:</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>First helpers must spend time understanding the tensions and pain
          in their friends' lives During this process, you should "invest" relationally
          because the resulting love feelings will be a key motivator in change.                 
        <li>Next you help your friend develop a theoretical and doctrinal understanding
          of his problems and of biblical ideals in the relational area. Attempting
          to change others without them understanding and agreeing to the goals
          involved usually amounts to manipulation rather than biblical instruction
          and admonition.                 
        <li>Finally, if you can persuade your friend to take appropriate action
          (often involving relational activities in community) it could provide
          an opportunity for the Holy Spirit to bring in permanent change. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>For instance, a friend who is unbalanced on the tribal-diffuse continuum
        should engage in activity that will tend to strengthen the opposite value.
        So, the person who is diffuse and addicted to stimulation (or present
        love feelings) may need to spend measured periods of time during the
        week in a situation involving routine, low stimulation (but not unimportant)
        work, and/or permanent love values. He may need to try building a lasting
        relationship with another, and learn how to resolve problems, persist
        in giving, and not move on to an easier, diffuse relationship.</p>
      <p>Depending on the level of tolerance already present, the period of time
        may have to be quite short and infrequent at first. The helper may have
        to accompany his friend in this activity to insure that there is no faking,
        and to make it easier. For example, it may be that the diffuse person
        does not know <i>how</i> to spend even one hour studying without talking
        or doing something else. You should be willing to join your friend for
        an evening combining a period of quiet study with a period of social
        stimulation afterward.</p>
      <p>A wise discipler should seek to assure that there are tangible rewards
        to such activity. If diffuse people are convinced of the rightness of
        discipline and consistency in their lives, and they see valuable rewards
        coming from investing in low-stimulation activity, they will likely build
        more affinity for such activity, and be able to branch out into other,
        similar areas. Eventually, tangible rewards may become unnecessary as
        your friend begins to enjoy a disciplined way of life and the fruit that
        naturally flows from it. However, it would be easy to underestimate the
        amount of time needed for such a transition. Careful and patient work
        is called for in effecting lasting change in these patterns of living.</p>
      <p>In a similar approach, you could teach permanent love values through
        a combination of counseling, teaching, and practice. A married couple
        with one or both partners exhibiting diffuse imbalance, (a poorly developed
        appreciation for permanent love values) may be asked to practice a carefully
        structured evening of involvement.</p>
      <p>Since the goal of the evening is to develop habits in the area of tribalistic
        love values, the environment should be relatively controlled. There should
        be no interruptions from outsiders, which usually means the phone should
        be off the hook. If the couple have children, the evening might be partly
        devoted to family tribal activity including the children. They could
        prepare special dinners, and tell stories, or other activities that are
        not rich in stimulation, but are rich in family "togetherness" values.
        After the children go to bed, the couple should engage in a period of
        interaction that you plan beforehand.</p>
      <p>Since such couples have often lost the ability to talk to each other,
        or may never have developed it in the first place, specific plans are
        usually necessary. Some men may have little idea how to initiate and
        sustain a conversation that make their wives feel loved. Here you may
        have to suggest the specific types of questions that would lead to a
        constructive period of communication. Typical questions that might bear
        fruit could include:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"How have you been feeling this week?"</p>
          <p>"Why do you think you have been feeling that way?" </p>
          <p>"How have I made you feel this week?" "Why?"</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>We can anticipate that a relationally weak man will find it very difficult
        to ask these questions and carefully listen to the answers. Of course
        many kinds of discussions could lead to understanding and love feelings
        on the part both spouses. Sometimes, the wife may be urged to spend some
        time working with a husband who interprets working together as love,
        or engaging in other activity that he interprets as "fun" (i. e. love
        feelings).</p>
      <p>These examples should suggest how you can creatively match an understanding
        of relational deficiencies with creative projects devised in advance.
        Many other types of projects can be used depending on the situation.
        For instance, single people can be urged to relate more deeply with roommates.</p>
      <p>If you use care in developing a progression of projects, your disciple
        should gain substantial relational experience focused at the area of
        his/her weakness. Although we will realistically never see a complete
        change of personality, and weaknesses will always remain, sometimes even
        minor movement in these areas leads to considerable relief in troubled
        people's lives. Disciples should be urged to build life-long habits along
        the lines of healthy relational patterns in precisely the areas they
        are weakest. Walking Christians who succeed in this long-term outcome
        report remarkable relational improvement. </p>

      <h2><em>Helping People With Parenting</em></h2>
      <p>How couples handle their children is an important question, but even
        in the church, this area is often considered private and personal. Couples
        are often relatively closed to input in this area. Parents tend to feel
        they know what they are doing with their kids, even though the evidence
        often suggests otherwise. Our first suggestion in this area is: proceed
        with caution. Parents don't want to be told that they are doing
        things wrong. We have found that parents will accept input if we stay
        positive and make our suggestions as ways to further enhance parenting,
      rather than as criticisms.</p>
      <p>Certainly if you are a family person yourself, and you work with family
        people, you will be discussing parenting plenty. If you feel you have
        noticed a problem in your disciple's parenting style, why not read
        one or two quality books on the subject that you know will make the points
        you feel you should make. This way, it comes from someone else, and you
        can just affirm what you see.</p>
      <h3>Areas to watch</h3>
      <p>Some parents fail to invest relationally in their kids. They don't
        spend time with their kids in a relational setting. We should urge parents
        to spend time going out with their kids, building the kind of relationship
        that will yield huge benefits in future years. Children are really the
        premier disciples given by God to parents. They should view them that
        way, and set up special times where they invest into their kids just
        like they would an adult disciple. They will never regret the time they
        spend going out with their kids. And when the kids reach the teen years
        they will be glad they built a close relationship, because that relationship
        is the only thing that will keep their kids out of serious trouble.</p>
      <p>Today, evangelical Christians are losing their kids as followers of
        Christ in huge numbers. George Barna has demonstrated that relativism
        and New Age spirituality have taken over a large percentage of youth
        today from Christian families. But surprisingly, teenage rebellion is
        virtually unknown in traditional cultures. In a typical African or Asian
        village the kids grow up without ever questioning their parents' beliefs
        and values. Only in the industrial west do we see the phenomenon where
        kids become alienated from their parents and their parents worldview
        when they hit their teen years. Why is this? We would suggest that in
        the first place, western parents are too busy to build good relationships
        with their kids. Also, western culture is changing at such a rapid rate
        that kids find themselves a part of a culture very different from that
        of their parents. Too often, parents are unable to accept these differences
        in culture, and try to fight against their kids' cultural tastes.
        This is especially true with Christian parents, who often view new cultural
        tastes as too &ldquo;worldly&rdquo; to allow. They try to disallow the
        music, dress, cinema, and language preferred by their kids' friends
        in high school. The result is teenage rebellion.</p>
      <p>This brings us to the question of the difference between permissive
        and controlling parenting styles. Studies show that children of permissive
        parents grow up deficient in many of the basic traits needed to be successful
        in life. They tend to lack self-control, have difficulty in long-term
        relationships, have a low threshold of frustration tolerance, higher
        delinquency rates, lower academic scores, and higher rates of drug and
        alcohol dependency. God placed parents in the family to lead and bring
        a level of discipline into the lives of their children. Permissive parenting
        is a disaster for kids.</p>
      <p>But the picture isn't that simple. Consider the diagram below:</p>
      <img src="graphics/parenting1.gif" alt="Graph of transition from external to internal control" width="480" height="322">
      <p>As children progress in age (the bottom axis) our goal is to see them
        moving away from external control to internal control. When a kid operates
        under external control, their parents make their decisions for them,
        and compel them follow those decisions. Virtually every decision in life
        is made by the parents when a kid is five years old, and rightly so.
        Parents tell the kid what he can eat, when to go to bed, what to wear,
        and what shows he can watch. But we know that by the time the child reaches
        eighteen years of age, he will make all his own decisions, and parents
        can do almost nothing to prevent this. We hope by then our kids will
        have internal control. They won't need parents or others making
        decisions for them, because they have the moral sense and wisdom to make
        their own decisions maturely and in God's way.</p>
      <p>Here is the catch. Kids don't go from 100% parental control to
        100% internal control on the day they turn eighteen. Wise parents realize
        they need to see clear evidence of good internal control well before
        they leave the house. This is the only way we can know they have been
        equipped to live healthy adult lives. That means that the transition
        from high parental control to low parental control needs to start some
        years before they reach eighteen. But many parents, especially Christian
        parents, try to keep parental control high way too long. These parents
        could be described as over-controlling parents.</p>
      <img src="graphics/parenting2.gif" alt="Graph of high-control parenting" width="473" height="300">
      <p>With high control parenting, even at fifteen, sixteen, and seventeen
        years of age, the child's parents are dictating many decisions.
        The result of such restraint is often teenage rebellion. The child senses
        he is old enough to be making these decisions for himself, but his parents
        won't let him. The resulting tension pits the child against his
        parents as he strives for freedom, and they strive to control him. This
        is a dangerous situation, because one casualty of teenage rebellion is
        the loss of relationship between parents and their kids. Rebelling teens
        won't share anything with their parents, and often describe their
        parents in contemptuous terms.</p>
      <p>We already argued that permissive parenting is not the answer.</p>
      <img src="graphics/parenting3.gif" alt="Graph of permissive parenting" width="455" height="288">
      <p>When parents are permissive, even twelve and thirteen year old kids
        make most of their own decisions. The lack of boundaries at this age
        harm the child's development. Too often, permissive parenting is
        a symptom of single-parent families, where the parent is too preoccupied
        or too tired to give sufficient guidance to children. But even intact
        families sometimes move to this style in a mistaken reaction to the high
        control they experienced in their own families. Others simply have bought
        into humanistic theories that kids know what is best for themselves.
        Some permissive parents are even reluctant to control anti-social behavior
        in their toddlers because they believe all controlling behavior is harmful.
        Research proves this is very misguided thinking.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">1</a></p>
      <p>Consider an equipping style of parenting:</p>
      <p><img src="graphics/parenting4.gif" alt="Graph of equipping parenting" width="456" height="296"></p>
      <p>In the equipping style, the parents' goal is to foster internal
        control in their kids. They openly discuss this project with their kids,
        and negotiate agreements where freedom is traded for proof that the kids
        can handle it. The object is to reach a point where the kids demonstrate
        good internal control (strong Christian values, ability to resist peer
        pressure, and do their work) well before they ever leave the house. Only
        when we see our kids demonstrating internal control in our presence can
        we assume they will have it away from our presence. This means the process
        has to begin early in the teen years. By the time kids are seventeen,
        they will hopefully be making most of their own decisions (still with
        accountability to their parents).</p>
      <p>Another problem we see often even in Christian families has to do with
        the values being communicated to children. When parents go crazy at sports
        games, and carefully reward and punish performance at school grades,
        but hardly notice a child's spiritual accomplishments (or lack thereof),
        what are we saying? Aren't such parents really extolling the values of
        the world but not of Christ? Especially as kids move out of early childhood
        and begin to make their own spiritual decisions, parents should be alert
        for any developments. Ask your disciple how her kids are doing spiritually,
        and see how coherent and definite the answers are. Another question would
        be: &quot;Are there any spiritual areas you worry about with your kid?&quot; Or, &quot;How
        do you reward and encourage spiritual development in your kids?&quot;</p>
      <p>If you share insight with your disciples in a way that helps them win
        their kids over to a life centered in God and his values, you will have
        helped both your disciple and the kids in a profound way. In our ministry
        environment, we work with families some of whom have now been in our
        church for twenty and thirty years. Their kids are now in high school
        and college in large numbers, and we see the fruit borne by different
        patterns of parenting. Some couples have raised kids who love their parents
        and the Lord in a wonderful way. Others have suffered the tragedy of
        losing their kids to the world. While even the best parenting can never
        guarantee kids will follow the Lord, equipping parenting makes it far
        more likely.</p>

      <p><a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1">1</a> Briggs reports on research findings: &ldquo;Over
        permissiveness was not the cure-all it was supposed to be, in fact, the
        results were disastrous. These children were more disturbed than those
        reared under authoritarianism&hellip;. [they] were self-centered and
        demanding. They failed to consider the rights of others. Their social
        relationships ran afoul, and they had trouble adjusting to the limits
        of classrooms and society in general. They expected others to cater to
        their whims just as their parents had, and they were invariably disappointed.

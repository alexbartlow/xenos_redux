      <h2><em>Helping People Build Their
        Marriages</em></h2>
      <h3>From the book:</h3>
      <p>We have to work with married disciples on the biggest area of their
        lives: their family. Again, marriage and family counseling are such vast
        areas of need that we can only mention some of the most common areas
        and refer the reader to further reading.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some marriages are &ldquo;unequally yoked.&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Cor. 6:14)
          In an unequally yoked marriage, one spouse is far more interested in
          pursuing the things of God than the other. Sometimes one spouse may
          be a non Christian or an ambiguous Christian, in the sense that their
          testimony is unclear and you see no evidence of the Holy Spirit in
          the life of the uninterested spouse.</li>
        <li>Sexual dysfunction is also common in marriages, and may come up in
          discipleship. Here, some good reading in the field of marriage counseling
          can help.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">1</a></li>
        <li>In the field of parenting we commonly see two areas that may need
          attention: failure to invest and avoiding extremes in the permissive-controlling
          continuum. If you share insight with your disciples in a way
          that helps them win their kids over to a life centered in God and his
          values, you will have helped both your disciple and the kids in a profound
          way.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>More ideas for helping people with their marriages</h3>
      <h4>Unequally-yoked marriages</h4>
      <p>In all these cases, the whole church has to become involved in an effort
        to win the unwilling person over to commitment. You, as the discipler,
        are typically working with the committed spouse, so you need help from
        those of the opposite sex in trying win over the reluctant spouse. The
        most natural choice for a helper is your own spouse.</p>
      <p>These situations are painful to both spouses, and have to be handled
        with care and patience. Consider calling on the committed spouse to hold
        back in some areas of involvement for the sake of the uninterested spouse.
        Some new believers who get too involved in Christian activities too quickly
        fail to win their reluctant spouses. But spouses who agree to drop all
        involvement in the church usually fail to win them as well. Common sense
        tells us that a spouse who suddenly begins leaving the house several
        nights a week poses a threat to the status quo of the marriage that will
        be hard for a disinterested spouse to accept. Sometimes, these marriages
        are distressed, and the spiritually eager spouse is happy to have an
        excuse to get away from her partner. This is wrong. We have to persuade
        our disciples that their future with the Lord needs to include their
        spouses, and put the burden on them to bend over backwards to win that
        reluctant spouse.</p>
      <p>Consider with your disciple: is her recent conversion to Christ making
        her more appealing or less appealing as a spouse? Nagging and browbeating
        are harmful. But she does need to lodge periodic appeals&mdash;perhaps
        offering to trade off on interests. &ldquo;I'll go to the game
        with you if you try out my home group.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Situations where the man is the reluctant partner are particularly difficult,
        and seem to be more common as well. Many men don't like the idea
        of being told what to do by their wives. Some wives have seen good results
        from simply asking their reluctant husbands questions about spiritual
        matters on a regular basis. By asking the reluctant husband, &ldquo;What
        do you think this passage means?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Why do you think our
        friend is so uninterested in God?&rdquo; the wife creates a leadership
        vacuum that tends to make the husband feel like learning more. Whereas
        her coming home and telling him why some of his ideas are in the wrong
        has the opposite effect.</p>
      <p>Our main goal is to get some kind of action from any reluctant spouse.
        Then we have something to encourage. If a reluctant wife finally agrees
        and comes to a Bible study group or church service, her husband will
        hopefully be in a position to share how &ldquo;So and so was saying how
        much she enjoyed you.&rdquo; Anything like praying together, or discussing
        something spiritual should be viewed as a big opportunity to shower appreciation
        and praise on any reluctant spouse.</p>
      <p>One thing is clear. Groups that only win one spouse end up in big trouble.
        Their discipling ministry will not go forward easily, because a reluctant
        spouse is usually in a position to stalemate the ministry of the eager
        spouse.</p>
      <h4>Sexual dysfunction: general tips</h4>
      <p>First, we are usually safe to assume that enhancing the personal part
        of the marriage relationship will also enhance the sexual part. Re-read
        the chapter on friendship building with your disciple in mind. Can you
        help him become a better friend in his marriage? Does he invest? Does
        he take an interest in her apart from sex? Is the relationship warm and
        positive? Any seriously sexually dysfunctional marriage should really
        go into marital counseling. Unless you see big results soon, plan on
        trying to persuade the couple to go to counseling.</p>
      <p>Secondly, you should check on whether your disciple is erected any barriers
        to successful sexual relations. For instance, we know of cases where
        a wife or husband are unhappy with their spouse's disinterest in
        sex, but have overlooked the importance of their own fifty pound weight
        gain. We have found ourselves engaged with disciples in efforts at weight
        management because over-eating is causing serious heartache. Disciplers
        have to be ready to engage in any area for the good of those they love.
        Usually, joining a disciple in a diet or exercise regimen does the discipler
        no harm, and can become a clear area of victory to celebrate together.</p>
      <p>Other obvious barriers could include pornography addiction on the part
        of the husband. These secrets come to light surprisingly often in close
        discipleship relationships, especially if the discipler is being open
        about his own sin problems. Western culture has reached a point today
        where raw porno is piped directly into people's households in unlimited
        quantity and virtually free of charge. We have abundant evidence today
        that pornography is rampant in the church in America. A husband who gratifies
        himself with pornography may reach a point where he prefers pornography
        and masturbation to sexual intimacy with his spouse. One of the main
        appeals of pornography for married men is the ease and convenience that
        comes without messy relational overhead. In a word, this kind of sexual
        gratification is selfish. No progress is likely in a marriage (or in
        other areas of spiritual living) when a man is hung up on porno. If a
        problem like this surfaces, don't just pray that it will go away.
        Work together on realistic, practical solutions like porn blockers,<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">2</a> good
        reading,<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">3</a> and learning to confess
        to an accountability partner.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, most sexually dysfunctional marriages involve a demander and
        a refuser. One spouse wants more sex, and the other wants it less, if
        ever. If our disciple is the demander, we have to persuade them that
        demanding is the worst thing they can do for their sexual relationship.
        Healthy sex involves winning the attentions of your partner, not demanding
        it. Anyone who is even partially uninterested in sex becomes more uninterested
        the more they see it as a duty. Legalism kills sexual responsiveness.
        Grace will gradually enhance it. Instead of demanding sex, work out a
        strategy for becoming more of a servant at home.</p>
      <p>If, on the other hand, your disciple is the refuser, try to work on
        the idea of gradually seeking for responsiveness and taking the opportunity
        when it appears. Praying along these lines can really help. Teach disciples
        to watch for Satan accusing their spouses to them. Satan relentlessly
        seeks to divide Christian marriages. </p>
      <p>Above all these issues, however, the most potent help for most sexually
        dysfunctional marriages is enhancing the quality of their personal relationship.
        Failure to communicate is at the root of most problems in marriage. Your
        church may offer marriage communication seminars. Or you could go over
        one of the numerous quality books on the subject. The best situation
        is one where you and your spouse can work with your disciple and his
        or her spouse as a couple. We often see noticeable improvement over time
        in these situations. See a larger discussion of this area in <a href="../relationships/index.htm"><em>Spiritual
        Relationships That Last</em></a></p>
      <p>Finally, if your disciple refuses to play the kind of role in marriage
        that God prescribes, you may need to be ready to put some godly pressure
        on. See the chapter on discipline in <em>Organic Disciplemaking</em>.</p>

        to, is fooling himself about his willingness to change. Even though some
        of these may be a nuisance, serious believers are willing to pay that
        small price for freedom. Cyber-Sitter blocks porn successfully, and can
        also block peer-to-peer file sharing, which is essential. Peer-to-peer
        is the premier way for many to acquire pornography. For adults, we suggest
        configuring it so that only adult, sexually-oriented sites are blocked
        (instead of including violence, hate, and the other blockers that are
        default, but which cause over-filtering). A less-restrictive approach
        is accountability software that sends a record of your web access to
        other partners. <a href="http://www.xxxchurch.com/" target="_blank">XXX Church</a> offers
        a free program, and there are several other commercial packages. While
        porno blockers won't stop a determined person from accessing pornography,
        they do reduce the temptation caused by constant, easy access to porno
        (the so-called, crime of opportunity). We find that those who have the
        desire to avoid pornography do much better when they set things up so
        that accessing more porno would require a deliberate series of actions,
        like going to a porno store or trying to defeat a porno blocker.</p>

          Good Men are Tempted</em>, or Larry Crabb <em>The Silence of Adam</em> (for
          married men) </p>

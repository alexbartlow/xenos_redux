      <h2><em>Getting A Vision Questionnaires</em></h2>
      <p>By Jessica Lowery</p>
      <h2>Introduction:</h2>
      <p>The following worksheets
        give support to a disciple-maker by offering suggestions on how to get
        a vision for someone. The first two sections are designed to help us
        pray for vision. The last three sections are questionnaires designed
        to be answered by the disciple maker thus increasing their vision. </p>
      <h2>Part One: Focused
            Prayer</h2>
      <p>It's good to have
        a weekly time for focused prayer. For example, every Sunday at 12:00
        noon I will pray for at least a half an hour about all the different
        people I would like to serve. This sheet of paper is simply a way to
        keep our minds on track. First, we make a list in the far left column
        of all the people we mean to pray for. Secondly, we reflect in prayer
        about any positive or negative observations we have had recently. Third,
        we ask God if any of our thoughts would be good to bring up with the
        person at this time.</p>
      <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
        <tr>

          <th width="25%"><p>Negatives</p></th>

      <h2><b><i>Part Two: In-depth
            Prayer</i></b></h2>
      <p>Every 6 months or so,
        it's a good idea to do a more big-picture prayer evaluation. It
        would be nice if these prayerful reflections were saved and could be
        accessed. You can do one of these prayer evaluations for yourself, your
        family, or your friends. If you are discipling someone, this type exercise
        could be completely revitalizing to your vision. Prayerfully analyze
        how the one you're praying for has grown in the past 6 months.
        Have there been victories in the areas of character, relationships, equipping,
        or ministry? Share your insights to reinforce vision.</p>
      <p><strong>Character</strong> = Has he overcome bad
        habits? Has she begun new good habits? Is he demonstrating more fruit
        of the Spirit?</p>
      <p><strong>Relationships</strong> = Does she have
        a healthy amount of friends? Has he been trying to meet new people? Are
        her relational habits healthier than before?</p>
      <p><strong>Equipping</strong> = What has he learned?
        What has she been reading/studying? Has he been sharing new knowledge
        with others?</p>
      <p><strong>Ministry</strong> =
        Has she been serving others? Does he have a burden to develop a personal
        ministry? Does she share their faith?</p>

      <h2><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        Part Three: Follow-up Questionnaire </i></b></h2>
      <p>Introduction: This questionnaire
        can be filled out for anyone who is trying to evangelize, establish,
        or pre-disciple someone. In order to get vision, we need to understand
        where this person is coming from. If you are discipling someone, you
        could give this worksheet to them in order to help them in their attempts
        to reach out to friends. You could talk about the questions together
        and challenge them to learn more about their friends.</p>
      <p>What is his/her worldview?</p>
      <p>[If not Christian] = Why not? Does he/she believe
        in a Creator God? What are their possible problems with God? What is
        their life story? How could their past play into their view of God?</p>
      <p>What important role could they play if they went
        for God? What are altruistic tendencies or natural gifts do they have?</p>
      <p>[If Christian] = Can they remember a point in
        their life when they asked Christ into their lives? Do they believe they
        are a part of God's Body, going to spend eternity with God? Do
        they understand that their sins are forgiven, they have a new position
        before God, and they are eternally secure?</p>
      <p>Do they understand the importance of evangelism;
        are they reaching out to family and friends?</p>
      <p>What possible roadblocks exist between them and
        walking with God? How might Satan try to take them out?</p>
      <p>What important role can/do they play in the Body?
        What serving tendencies or spiritual gifts can you see them having?</p>
      <h2><b><i>Part Four: Disciple-Making
            Questionnaire</i></b></h2>
      <p>This is a worksheet is
        meant to be filled out once per person preferably at the beginning of
        a new relationship. Keep it, so that in 6 months or a year you can refer
        back and see the growth that has occurred. If you fill out the sheet
        privately and are unable to answer a question, ask your friend what the
        answer is. In this way you will become better acquainted with their spirituality.
        Another option is filling out the questionnaire with your friend. My
        suggestion if you choose to do this, is that you give the sheet to them
        after a period of time (6 months to a year) to show them how they've
        grown.</p>
      <p>Have they made the second
        decision: to become a disciple, to be committed to spiritual growth,
        and to give their life up to the leadership of God?</p>
      <h3><b>Part 1 &#8211; The
          means of growth</b></h3>
      <h4>The Bible:</h4>
      <p>Do they read the word?</p>
      <p>Do they understand its importance?</p>
      <p>Do they talk about what they're learning
        in it?</p>
      <p>Do they know how to properly interpret it?</p>
      <p>Are they studying the Bible with anyone?</p>
      <p>If this area is a weakness,
        what do you plan to do about it right now (if anything)? If this area
        is a strength, how can you encourage them?</p>
      <h4>Prayer</h4>
      <p>Do they pray privately?</p>
      <p>Do they pray publicly?</p>
      <p>Do they understand the
        importance of prayer?</p>
      <p>Do they pray for others
        and for themselves?</p>
      <p>If this area is a weakness,
        what do you plan to do about it right now (if anything)? If this area
        is a strength, how can you encourage them?</p>
      <h4>Fellowship</h4>
      <p>Are they involved in fellowship &#8211; to
        what degree?</p>
      <p>Are they initiating spiritual
        input at meetings (i.e. sharing, praying, spiritual conversations, serving)?</p>
      <p>Are they tactful and sensitive
        to non-Christians at meetings? Do they meet and talk to new people at
        meetings?</p>
      <p>Do they understand that
        they have an important impact &#8211; that their absence would be damaging?</p>
      <p>If this area is a weakness,
        what do you plan to do about it right now (if anything)? If this area
        is a strength, how can you encourage them?</p>
      <h4>Suffering/ Discipline
          of the Holy Spirit</h4>
      <p>Do they expect suffering
        and dry times in their faith?</p>
      <p>Do they understand how
        to respond to suffering and how it can be used for the good in their
        lives?</p>
      <p>What sinful response to
        suffering are they the most likely to indulge in (i.e. blaming, shutting
        people out, depression, outbursts of anger, etc.)</p>
      <p>If this area is a weakness,
        what do you plan to do about it right now (if anything)? If this area
        is a strength, how can you encourage them?</p>
      <h4>Ministry/Serving love</h4>
      <p>Do they reach out to friends
        and family?</p>
      <p>What help can you offer
        with evangelism (i.e. giving them salvation verses to use,
        going with them to meet their friends, asking them about their testimony,
        etc.)?</p>
      <p>Do they have a vision
        for disciple-making?</p>
      <p>Is there someone they

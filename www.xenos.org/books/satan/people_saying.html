      <p class="style14">&ldquo;We have long needed a lucid, biblically sound presentation  of spiritual warfare and the satanic kingdom. This is it, and it is both  readable and deep. Everyone should read it.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="style14">&mdash;Grant R. Osborne, PhD,  Professor of New Testament, Trinity Evangelical   Divinity School</p>
      <p class="style14">&ldquo;Have you ever wondered why the disciples  had so much trouble figuring Jesus out? After all, they had all the Old  Testament prophecies. Jesus was right there with them. Dennis McCallum's thesis&mdash;that  all the data is in the Bible but it wasn't until after the resurrection that  Jesus connected the dots&mdash;is most intriguing. It also explains why  the devil so miscalculated the outcome of his plot to kill Jesus. Read with your  Bible open and you'll learn how to gain victory in our contemporary war with  darkness.&rdquo; <br />
        </p>
      <p class="style14">&mdash;Gerry  Breshears, PhD, Professor of  Theology, Western Seminary</p>
      <p class="style14">&ldquo;Stop reading these endorsements! Start reading this book!  Dennis is a ministry veteran, a gifted leadership practitioner, and a diligent  student of God&rsquo;s Word. His understanding of the power of the Cross and spiritual  warfare is accurate and effective. Read it.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
      <p class="style14">&mdash;Dr. Dave  Earley, Chairman of Department of Pastoral Leadership <span class="style15">&amp; Church Planting, Liberty  Baptist Theological Seminary</span></p>
      <p class="style14">&ldquo;Dennis   McCallum has written a balanced and thoughtful work on an  often overlooked but essential topic: the reality of Satan and his practices as  he misrepresents God's goodness and misleads humanity into believing in its own  goodness.&nbsp;McCallum writes in a biblical and realistic way, using thorough  research to answer vital questions effectively.&nbsp;The chapters on Satan and  Your Ministry are especially helpful, and ring true to reality.&nbsp;Here is a  well-done book full of vital truth.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
      <p class="style14">&mdash;Dr.  Bill Lawrence, President of Leader Formation International; Senior Professor  Emeritus of Pastoral Ministries, Dallas  Theological Seminary </p>
      <p class="style14">&ldquo;Dennis McCallum writes about Satan and demons in a  biblical, sensible way. I&rsquo;ve read books about the spiritual realm that were  sensational, opinionated, and extra-biblical.&nbsp;This book is different.  McCallum&nbsp;stays close to the biblical text while writing an easy to read  book.&nbsp;You will not only go away with a comprehensive knowledge of Satan  and his kingdom, but you&rsquo;ll discover practical steps to overcome them.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="style14">&mdash;Joel&nbsp;Comiskey,  PhD, President of Joel Comiskey Group. Author, <em>Cell Gr<span class="style15">oup Explosion</span></em><span class="style15">, <em>Appointment with the King</em> and others.      </span></p>
      <p class="style14">&quot;Dennis McCallum has written a profoundly helpful and  insightful book that will enable believers to understand the nature and reality  of our spiritual battle, and thereby be more effective in fulfilling Jesus'  mission.&nbsp;Drawing upon solid biblical support, careful reasoning, and  extensive experience, he has developed an important tool from which all  Christians can greatly benefit.&quot;</p>
      <p class="style14">&mdash;R. Scott Smith, PhD, Associate  Professor of Ethics and Christian Apolo<span class="style15">getics,  Biola University</span></p>
      <p class="style14">&ldquo;Dennis McCallum in a clear and concise way provides us with  a sure guide through the biblical and experiential evidence about Satan and his  role not only in&nbsp;human history but also in church history and in the lives  of individual Christians.&nbsp;Not  since&nbsp;C.S. Lewis's&nbsp;<em>The  Screwtape Letters</em> have we had as&nbsp;convincing a presentation that  Satan's favorite method of relating to modern people is to convince them he is  not real, thereby giving him freedom to&nbsp;operate amongst the unsuspecting.  Highly Recommended.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style14">&mdash;Dr. Ben Witherington, III, Amos Professor  of NT for Doctoral Studies, Asbury Theological Seminary; Doctoral Faculty, St.  Mary's College, St. Andrews University, Scotland</p>
      <p class="style14">I've read The Screwtape Letters by C.S. Lewis, Satan: His Motives &amp;  Methods by Lewis Sperry Chafer and countless other articles, essays and  excerpts, yet this book takes the cake! In all areas Satan can affect  the physical and spiritual world McCallum covers with brilliant wisdom  and Biblical fortitude. There is no shortage of literature on Satan,  however there is an incredible shortage of Bible-based information. In  the same way no other book on the subject covers practical example for  the individual and the church that can be directed back to scripture as  the authority like this one. I started the book for the first time and  didn't put it down until I was half way through. The only reason I  stopped was because I had to go to work, otherwise I would have  finished the entire book. Although I plan now to go back and reread at  a slower pace and take notes on each chapter,...it's that good! This  book comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, a must read for any spiritually minded  person!!!</p>
      <p class="style14">&mdash;Christopher P. Harty II (Reader, Amazon)</p>
      <p class="style14">Satan. Real? Imaginary? This book gives some compelling evidences of  his reality. I found it interesting to see what man imagines that Satan  thinks. This book is filled with interesting thoughts backed by  scripture on how to combat his influence in our lives. I appreciate the  reminder of the spiritual warfare going on around us. We are in a  battle and this book gives us tools to use scripture to combat the  enemy. I love check lists and go to charts for quick references. This  book has 10 scriptures to refute Satan's lies and fifteen practical  ideas for resisting temptation. What a great reference for each  Christian to own.</p>
      <p class="style14">--Dawn Ewing (Amazon reader)</p>
      <p class="style14">What an incredible resource to have in your library. If you ever have  times, as I do, when you doubt the reality of a very personal devil and  the activity Satan engages in, you'll be well-served to pull this book  out and jump in. There is a spiritual war being waged, and those  working against us are not to be taken lightly. Thanks for the expose,  McCallum, even as it draws more demonic fire on you for the clarity and  insight of your much-needed message.</p>
      <p class="style14">--Steve O (Amazon reader)</p>
      <p class="style14">For a long time the dedicated Christian had essentially two ways of  dealing with Satan and the demonic; 1. You could act like a  Charismaniac, finding a demon under every bush and &quot;binding the devil&quot;  in every room you entered or 2. You could act like a theological  liberal and, despite the biblical material, pretend that there is no  Satan or demonic realm. Lately there has been a more reasonable and  biblical approach to the subject and this Dennis McCallum book is one  of the most important contributions to date.</p>
      <p class="style14">--Pastor Anthony (Amazon reader)</p>
      <p class="style14">My husband bought this book, and while preparing to teach on Ephesians  6, I started to read it and finished it in two days. It was highly  readable, super-informative, and had a very balanced and  well-researched view. I loved learning the information presented in  this book, and consider it vital to holding a well-informed theological  view of the powers of darkness and a Christian's proper response to the  activities of the Enemy. I hope anyone considering this book will buy  and read it, and when my husband finishes the book, we have already  promised to lend it to a few of our friends.</p>
      <p class="style14">--M. Hickman Romine (Amazon reader)</p>
      <p class="style14">I could not put this book down. Generally I skim around and draw out  the main points but not with this book. A real eye-opener to the  spiritual battle going on around us. I like the way the book references  the bible to look up verses yourself. Covers all my questions about  evil, and I had many</p>
      <p class="style14">--Terra Alderman (Amazon reader)</p>
      <p class="style14">This book is well thought out and well delivered. McCallum accurately  portrays Satan's power and weaknesses without needless sensationalism.  I would highly recommend this book to any Christian (or anyone else for  that matter).</p>
      <p class="style14">--Adam W. Kelly (Amazon reader)</p>
      <p class="style14">Dennis McCallum's book on Satan is a much needed book to explain some  of the many difficulties Christians have in understanding how to walk  with God. We do have an enemy and many times it is easy to forget that.  Also, many of us are plagued by negative thinking which destroys our  peace of mind and having joy in everyday life with God and others. I  highly recommend this book as a reality check about the struggles we  face. Every good fighter studies their enemy. This book is an escellent  study in the strategies of Satan, as well as how to live well in the  everyday battle.</p>
      <p class="style14">--Catherine A. Downs (Amazon reader)</p>
      <p class="style14">This is certainly McCallum's best book, yet. It gives a well-reasoned  and easily accessible study on the biblical view of Satan. It does,  however, emphasize Jesus and his authority over him. This is a must  read for every believer.</p>
      <p class="style14">J. Rochford (Amazon reader) </p>
      <p class="style14">An effective army needs to know its enemy, but what do we really know about Satan and how he operates? Pastor Dennis McCallum has written&nbsp;<em><a title="Satan and His Kingdom" href="http://www.amazon.com/Satan-His-Kingdom-Bible-Matters/dp/0764206494/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1248092104&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"><em>Satan and His Kingdom</em></a></em> (Bethany House) to provide solid biblical understanding about Satan, the demonic and spiritual warfare. When an excellent New Testament scholar like Ben Witherington recommends a book like this, I want to know more. (Ben says, &ldquo;Not since C.S. Lewis&rsquo; <em>The Screwtape Letters</em> have we had as convincing a presentation that Satan&rsquo;s favorite method of relating to modern people is to convince them that he is not real, thereby giving him freedom to operate among the unsuspecting.&rdquo;) This is a book that pastors and church leaders will find to be an excellent resource for an important and little-discussed topic.</p>

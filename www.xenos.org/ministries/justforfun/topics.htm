      <h1>Sample Topics </h1>
      <h3>Alternative Medicine</h3>
      <p>People today want more control over their health than ever before. We 
        want to not only avoid illness, but also extend our lifespan. But it seems 
        that modern medicine can not always get the job done for us. As a result, 
        interest and research into alternative forms of medicine, both physical 
        and spiritual are growing daily.</p>
      <p><a href="cc_resources/AltMedicine.pdf">Handout in PDF format. </a></p>
      <h3><a href="cc_resources/animal.htm">Animal Rights and Human Responsibility</a></h3>
      <p> Do animals have rights? If so, what are they? If not, why not? 
        The animal rights movement is radical and according to many, extreme. 
        The movement raises fascinating questions about cruelty, the nature of 
        life, and whether humans should be viewed as any different than other 
        species. If so, why?</p>
      <h3>Art and Beauty</h3>
      <p>Art is arguably one of the best ways to understand 
        what is happening in the culture. The capacity to appreciate beauty is 
        transcendent and yet &quot;tastes&quot; are relative and very personal. 
        Our attitudes and values about beauty often correspond to our views about 
        the nature of truth. What is it that drives humans to create, yet not 
        the animals?</p>
      <h3> Challenges Facing America&#146;s Youth</h3>
      <p> The last ten years have seen alarming trends amongst 
        America&#146;s youth. Many experts agree that addressing growing levels 
        of violence and despair among our teenage population should be our highest 
        priority. However, the difficulty consists in developing consensus as 
        to the sources and solutions to these complicated issues.</p>
      <h3> <font size="1">&nbsp;</font>Cloning</h3>
      <p>Now that sheep have been cloned, will humans be next? What are the ethical 
        and legal implications of our ability to clone?</p>
      <p><a href="cc_resources/Cloning.pdf" target="_blank">Handout in PDF format. </a></p>
      <h3><font size="3"> </font>Commitment and Relationships</h3>
      <p>Recent studies show that a lifelong committed relationship is considered 
        a top priority by an overwhelming number of people living in Western culture. 
        And yet, most of those surveyed are very pessimistic about maintaining 
        their own relationships due to the perceived constraints placed on the 
        individual by those same commitments. Is the obvious need for commitment 
        incompatible with the value we place on individualism in our culture? 
        Guest facilitator, Tim Lipovsky, will lead us in this thought provoking 
        discussion.</p>
      <h3><a href="cc_resources/well.htm">Dying to be Well</a></h3>
      <p>What is health anyway? When is enough, enough? Is wellness a purely physiological 
        processs?  We&#146;ll survey some modern and ancient views 
        on these and related questions.</p>
      <h3>Evolution and Biblical Christianity</h3>
      <p>Though reportedly in direct opposition, could it be possible that they 
        are both true? Or is biblical Christianity even believable in light of 
        the scientific evidence that has been found? What if these two do contradict 
        each other? What would the implication be to my life? Or does any of it 
        matter?</p>
      <h3>Fatherhood in the New Millenium</h3>
      <p> We will explore 
        such questions as: Why has so much public and political attenion been 
        given to fatherhood? What does it mean to be a dad in a rapidly changing 
        culture?</p>
      <h3><a href="cc_resources/forgivereac.htm">Forgiveness in the Age of Rage</a></h3>
      <p>One authority says, &quot;A particularly pernicious myth is that &#145;healing 
        requires forgiveness&#146; of the abuser. Victims lose some percentage 
        of capacity and that capacity remains lost so long as the victim is stuck 
        in the cycle of &#145;understanding and forgiveness&#146;.&quot; Another 
        says, &quot;I will not live with purpose and joy unless I love. I will 
        not be able to love unless I forgive.&quot; Which of these is right? </p>
      <h3>Forgiveness in Relationships</h3>
      <p><font size="4"> </font>Why should I forgive? Isn&#146;t that a 
        sign of weakness? Won&#146;t it leave me open to be victimized again?<font size="2"> 
        </font>I wish I could &quot;let things go&quot; but I can't.&nbsp; Should 
        we only forgive when the person wants us to forgive them or would it be 
        better to forgive unconditionally?</p>
      <h3>Guilt &amp; Shame</h3>
      <p>Why do I feel guilty? Why do I think something is wrong with me? Are 
        these feelings good or harmful? What should I do about them? We will survey 
        some modern and ancient views on these and related questions.</p>
      <h3>In the Eye of the Beholder (Art &amp; Beauty)</h3>
      <p>Have society&#146;s ideas about beauty changed? 
        Does art imitate life or does life imitate art? Where do we draw the line 
        between art and obscenity? How do we determine what is beautiful? And 
        why do humans have the capacity to appreciate beauty?</p>
      <h3> Internet and Relationships</h3>
      <p>How is the Internet affecting our culture and the way we form relationships?</p>
      <p>Do you use voice mail or e-mail to avoid people? Is the Internet the 
        place to find a date? Are we closer as members of society or or are we 
        drifting farther apart as a result of the Internet?</p>
      <h3> <font size="1">&nbsp;</font>Jack Kevorkian: Man of Mercy or Doctor 
        of Death?</h3>
      <p>More and more people seem to view assitance 
        in suicide or active euthanasia as a legitimate way to deal with pain, 
        suffering or terminal illness. Why are more people coming to this conclusion? 
        Many view assisted suicide as an act of mercy. Why do others disagree? 
        What would be the possible implications of making it legal for physicians 
        (or others) to directly cause people&#146;s death? When terminally ill 
        people request help in suicide, is death really what they need? Is this 
        desire to die significantly different from a rejected lover&#146;s desire 
        to die or from suicide due to depression? If so, why is it different? 
        Rather than legalizing assisted suicide, are there other things the health 
        care system could change to address the perceived need for assisted suicide?</p>
      <p><a href="cc_resources/Kevorkian.pdf" target="_blank">Handout in PDF format</a> </p>
      <h3>Love</h3>
      <p>What is love, and how can we keep ourselves in it? Is it a fleeting feeling, 
        or can it be sustained? Why can&#146;t we have satisfying, lasting love 
        relationships? Enjoy a thought-provoking discussion on the different 
        views of love from anthropologists, psychiatrist and scientists. </p>
      <h3>Men and Women</h3>
      <p>What is gender? Are there differences between men and women that go beyond 
        the physical? Is it possible to generalize at all? Should we focus only 
        on sameness between sexes, or is there value in recognizing difference? Enjoy this discussion, including samples of leading opinions in this controversial 
        field.</p>
      <h3> Money</h3>
      <p>Why do we love it so much? Join us in a discussion of the widespread 
        materialism of our American culture as we question the emphasis and value 
        we place on financial security and comfort.</p>
      <h3> Multiculturalism</h3>
      <p>Multiculturalism is a movement designed to facilitate awareness and appreciation 
        of diverse cultures. In some circles, it teaches that all cultures should 
        be empowered to preserve, unchanged, their unique cultural reality. What 
        impact has Multiculturalism had on society so far? What other areas of 
        society have been effected? Where is the movement headed?</p>
      <h3> <strong>Parenting: Does it Really Matter?</strong></h3>
      <p>Why do kids turn out the way they do? How much of it is parenting? How 
        have our parents affected us? This issue impacts all of us, parents and 
        non-parents alike, so come and discuss the diverse and contradictory views 
        on this question: &quot;Do parents matter?&quot;</p>
      <h3>Self Esteem</h3>
      <p>We all need it &#151; but where do we get it? Do we determine our own 
        self-esteem, or is it determined for us? Does our self-esteem determine 
        our performance, or does our performance determine our self-esteem? Discover how to translate 
        these and other questions into real-life tools we can use to help maintain 
        a healthy self-image.</p>
      <h3> Simplify Your Life</h3>
      <p> <b> </b>Stressed out?! We&#146;ll look at what 
        social scientists, popular authors, and the Bible have to say about managing 
        our hectic schedules, reducing clutter and living with more meaning, depth, 
        and purpose. Does your life need to be simplified? Take this short quiz. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> I&#146;m too busy right now to take this quiz. T/F</li>
        <li>My house is overflowing with things I don&#146;t need and can&#146;t 
          keep track of. T/F</li>
        <li>My to-do list is longer than one page. T/F</li>
        <li>I can&#146;t find my to-do list! T/F</li>
        <li>I schedule appointments with myself. T/F</li>
        <li>I never spend enough time on what matters most. T/F</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you answered TRUE to three or more of these, 
        WATCH OUT your gonna blow a gasket!!<font
  size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <h3>Sports: A Window Onto American Values</h3>
      <p>The esteem we place on professional athletes, 
        the amount of time and money we spend as spectators and fans, to the increased 
        involvement in youth athletics reflect our love for sports. But have we 
        gone too far? Has the value of sports become an obsession? When does competitiveness 
        become ruthlessness? When does committment become obsession? When does 
        &quot;doing your best&quot; become &quot;win at all costs&quot;? </p>

      <h3>The Blame Game</h3>
      <p>Have we become a nation of victims? Is anyone ever responsible for anything? 
        How much of my future is determined by my past? As legislation ratifies 
        more and more rights, must there be more and more violations? Should we 
        try or is it even possible to control &quot;rights inflation?&quot; Join 
        us as we discuss what one noted sociologist has called &quot;the most 
        pervasive trend in the last three decades.&quot;</p>
      <h3 align="left"> The Impact 
        of Computer Technology on Today&#146;s Culture</h3>
      <p>Without exception, technology affects each and 
        every one of us. Experts point out that the impact of computer technology 
        on our culture has surpassed that of the industrial revolution. We&#146;ll 
        explore the social implications of technology on community and personal 
        relationships and, more importantly, our views as individuals.</p>
      <h3>The Problem of Evil</h3>
      <p>We will address such questions as &quot;How can there be a loving God 
        when we see such horrific displays of evil around us?&quot; &quot;Is there 
        really such a thing as evil?&quot; As we discuss these questions we will 
        also look at how different world-views address these questions.</p>
      <h3><a href="cc_resources/judge.htm">To Judge or not to judge</a></h3>
      <p>People who are judgmental can be annoying. Tolerance is an important 
        feature of any free society. Who am I to say another&#146;s personal faith 
        is wrong or that other&#146;s tastes in fashion are somehow inferior? 
        Yet, most of us would condemn groups like the KKK without hesitation. 
        Also, when we face a city and country racked by rampant crime we often 
        hear the call for stricter law enforcement and longer sentences. Why do 
        we instinctively know that judgments are right in some cases, but not 
        in others? </p>
      <h3> Today&#146;s Values</h3>
      <p> Where will they take us? What are values? How do our values impact our 
        day to day decisions? What values are currently driving our culture? How 
        might those values effect our future? Were the &#145;good old days&#146; 
        values all that good? Are there universal values that would work well 
        for all of us?</p>
      <h3> <a href="cc_resources/afterlife.htm">Views of the AfterLife</a></h3>
      <p>Does life continue after death? How do different cultures and people 
        view this interesting subject?</p>
      <h3>What do you want from Your Doctor?</h3>
      <p>What is our doctor&#146;s role in making decisions about our lives and 
        health? What do we expect from our doctors? Can (and should) they fulfill 
        these expectations?</p>
      <p><a href="cc_resources/Want-from-doctor.pdf" target="_blank">Handout in PDF format. </a><a href="cc_resources/Want-from-doctor-Notes.pdf" target="_blank">Facilitator notes in PDF format. </a></p>
      <h3>Why evil?</h3>
      <p>We will explore such questions as: why is there evil in the world? How 
        do you deal with evil? Come and share your views as we attempt to understand 
        evil in the world today from various perspectives.</p>
      <h3>Workplace Ethics</h3>
      <p>What determines what is ethical in the workplace? How can we resolve
         different-views of what is ethical? Come and share your views  about
        this current and controversial topic.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>While some controversy is fine, subjects should generally <b>avoid extremely 
        controversial topics, </b>such as abortion or politics. Such issues often 
        have no middle ground on which agreement, friendship or understanding 
        can be based. Therefore, these topics are poor pre-evangelistic topics.      </p>
      <p>The discussion is <b>not</b> intended to preach the Gospel. Neither is 
        there an effort to &quot;win&quot; a debate. The main point is to be interested 
        in understanding other people's views, respectfully sharing our own, and 
        to enjoy getting to know one another. </p>
      <p>Facilitators of successful discussions should send in information on 
        their topic to the C&amp;C administrator at the office, so other groups 
        can take advantage. Facilitators often visit other groups and offer their 
        discussion there. Please offer a $50-stipend to visiting facilitators 
        to compensate them for giving up an evening to enhance ours.<b><small><br>

<h1>Animal Rights and Human Responsibilities<br>
Resource Sheet</h1>

<p>Dennis McCallum</p>

<p>This quote sheet is passed out, but held in reserve during the discussion and 
  if appropriate, selected quotes are read aloud at points to stimulate conversation. 
</p>

<h3>Aristotle</h3>

<p>Held to four distinct levels of matter: 
<ol>
  <li>inert, inanimate matter </li>
  <li>plants = capable of self-nourishment and reproduction </li>
  <li>animals = endowed with sensation, motion, and all degrees of mental functions 
    except reason </li>
  <li>Man = all that animals have + reason</li>
</ol>

<h3>Rene Descartes</h3>

<li><big>animals = pure machines </big></li>
<big>man = machines + minds </big> 
<h3>John Locke</h3>
<p><big>Thoughts come from sensation and from reflection. Animals have particular 
  sensory ideas and limited powers of reason. But they have no general ideas or 
  powers of abstraction and consequently no language for their expression.</big></p>
<h3><big>Charles Darwin</big></h3>
<p><big>&quot;Attempted to show that in varying degrees, animals use tools, form 
  abstract concepts, employ language, and experience beauty and reverence.&quot;</big></p>
<hr>
<h3><big>Tom Regan</big></h3>
<p><big>&quot;The Case For Animal Rights&quot; in <i>Animal Rights and Human Obligations</i>, 
  Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1989</big>
<li><big>&quot;[with commercial animal agriculture] the fundamental wrong here 
  is not that animals are kept in stressful close confinement or in isolation, 
  or that their pain and suffering, their needs and preferences are ignored or 
  discounted. All these are wrong, of course, but they are not the fundamental 
  wrong . . . The deeper systematic wrong [is] the [view] that allows these animals 
  to be viewed and treated as lacking independent value, as resources for us--as, 
  indeed, a renewable resource. Giving farm animals more space, more natural environments, 
  more companions does not right the fundamental wrong, any more than giving lab 
  animals more anesthesia or bigger, cleaner cages would right the fundamental 
  wrong in their case. Nothing less than the total dissolution of commercial animal 
  agriculture will do this. . .&quot; 114</big></li>
<hr>
<h3><big>Peter Singer</big></h3>
<p><big>&quot;All Animals Are Equal&quot; in <i>Animal Rights and Human Obligations</i>, 
  Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1989 </big>
<li><big>&quot;We would be on shaky ground if we were to demand equality for blacks, 
  women and other groups of oppressed humans while denying equal consideration 
  to non humans.&quot; 75</big></li>
<li><big>Opponents of equality between races and sexes argue that there are differences 
  either between races of sexes, and therefore we are justified if we prefer the 
  interests of one type over the other.. .our concern for others ought not to 
  depend on what they are like, or what abilities they possess. . .If possessing 
  a higher degree of intelligence does not entitle one human to use another for 
  his own ends, how can it entitle humans to exploit non humans? p. 77.78</big></li>
<li><big>The racist violates the principle of equality by giving greater weight 
  to the interests of members of his own race. . . Similarly, the speciesist allows 
  the interests of his own species to override the greater interests of members 
  of other species. p.79</big></li>
<li><big>[the question has been]. . . &quot;would the abolitionist be prepared 
  to let thousands die if they could be saved by experimenting on a single animal? 
  . . .The way to reply is . . .'Would the experimenter be prepared to perform 
  his experiment on an orphaned human infant, if that were the only way to save 
  many lives?'&quot; p. 80</big></li>
<li><big>Singer argues that &quot;sentience&quot; loosely defined as the ability 
  to suffer is the dividing line between those who must be treated equally because 
  they have rights.</big></li>
<li><big>If human infants have lower IQ and less sensation to pain than chimpanzees, 
  experiments on chimps would be worse than using human babies.</big></li>
<li>&quot;Experimenting on animals, and eating their flesh, are perhaps the two 
  major forms of speciesism in our society . . .&quot; p. 81</li>
<li>The idea of a distinctive human dignity and worth . . .goes back to both classical 
  and Judeo-Christian doctrines. Contemporary philosophers have cast off these 
  metaphysical and religious shackles. . .[but] Once we ask why it should be that 
  all humans--including infants, mental defectives, psychopaths, Hitler, Stalin, 
  and the rest--have some kind of dignity or worth that no elephant, pig, or chimpanzee 
  can ever achieve, we see that this question is as difficult to answer [as the 
  basis for animal rights]. . . talk of intrinsic dignity of moral worth only 
  takes the problem back one step . . . Philosophers frequently introduce ideas 
  of dignity, respect, and worth at the point at which other reasons appear to 
  be lacking, but this is hardly good enough.&quot; p. 83</li>
<li>In case there are those who still think it may be possible to find some relevant 
  characteristic that distinguishes all humans from all members of other species, 
  I shall refer . . . to the existence of some humans who quite clearly are below 
  the level of awareness, self-consciousness, intelligence, and sentience, of 
  many non-humans.&quot; 83</li>
<li>Quoting Stanley Benn's article, &quot;Egalitarianism and Equal Consideration 
  of Interests&quot; (Nomos IX Equality p.62ff) where he argues that equality 
  of consideration for all humans regardless of differences is the only basis 
  for egalitarianism but then says, &quot;not to possess human shape is a disqualifying 
  condition. However faithful or intelligent a dog may be, it would be a monstrous 
  sentimentality to attribute to him interests that could be weighed in an equal 
  balance with those of human beings. . . .if, for instance, one had to decide 
  between feeding a hungry baby or a hungry dog, anyone who chose the dog would 
  generally be reckoned morally defective, unable to recognize a fundamental inequality 
  of claims.&quot; . . . but why should there be any fundamental inequality of 
  claims between a dog and a human imbecile? . . . That the imbecile is not rational 
  is just the way things have worked out, and the same is true of the dog--neither 
  is any more responsible for their mental level. . . p. 84</li>
<h3>Lawrence C. Becker</h3>
<p>&quot;The Priority of Human Interests&quot; in <i>Animal Rights and Human Obligations</i>, 
  (Engelwood Cliffs NJ:Prentice Hall, 1989)
<ul>
  <li>There are certain traits of character people ought to have . . . [which] 
    order preferences by &quot;social distance&quot;--that is, give priority to 
    the interests of those &quot;closer&quot; to us in social relationships over 
    the interests of those farther away. Animals are typically &quot;farther away&quot; 
    from us than other human beings . . .&quot; p. 87</li>
</ul>
<h3>James Rachels</h3>
<p>&quot;Darwin, Species, and Morality,&quot; in <i>Animal Rights and Human Obligations</i>, 
  (Englewood Cliffs NJ:Prentice Hall, 1989)
<ul>
  <li>&quot;Darwinism also undermines some aspects of traditional morality. Traditional 
    morality depends, at crucial points, on the assumption that there is something 
    morally special about being human--The fact that a being is human, rather 
    than, say, canine or bovine, makes a big difference, according to traditional 
    morality, in how it may be treated. My thesis is that &quot;the gradual illumination 
    of men's minds,&quot; of the sort provided by Darwin's theory, must lead inevitably 
    to the conclusion that this assumption is false.&quot; </li>
  <li>&quot;Unqualified speciesism and racism are twin doctrines.&quot; p. 97</li>
</ul>
<h3>R. G. Frey</h3>
<p>&quot;The Case Against Animal Rights&quot; in <i>Animal Rights and Human Obligations,</i> 
  (Englewood Cliffs NJ:Prentice Hall, 1989)
<ul>
  <li>[Regan cites the case of deficient humans to show we must grant animal rights] 
    But I do not regard all human life as of equal value; I do not accept that 
    a very severely mentally-enfeebled human or an elderly human fully in the 
    grip of senile dementia or an infant born with only half a brain has a life 
    whose value is equal to that of normal, adult humans.&quot; p. 116</li>
</ul>
<p><b>[We withhold the name of this next author until after reading one or two 
  quotes. Only after people react do we reveal that the author is Adolf Hitler, 
  <i>Mein Kampf</i>, James Murphy trans., (London: Hurst and Blackett Ltd.)]</b></p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, in periods of distress or under bad climatic condition, 
  or if the soil yields too poor a return, nature herself tends to check the increase 
  of population in some countries and among some races, but by a method which 
  is quite as ruthless as it is wise. It does not impede the procreative faculty 
  as such; but it does impede the further existence of the offspring by submitting 
  it to such test and privation that everything which is less strong or less healthy 
  is forced to retreat into a bosom of the unknown. Whatever survives these hardships 
  of existence has been tested and tried a thousand fold, hardened and rendered 
  fit to continue the process of procreation; so that the same thorough selection 
  will begin all over again. By thus dealing brutally with the individual and 
  recalling him the very moment he shows that he is not fitted for the trials 
  of life, Nature preserves the strength of the race and the species and raises 
  it to the highest degree of efficiency.&quot; p. 82, 83</p>
<p>Man must realize that a fundamental law of necessity reigns throughout the 
  whole realm of nature and that his existence is subject to the law of eternal 
  struggle and strife. He will then feel that there cannot be a separate law for 
  mankind in a world in which planets and suns follow their orbits, where moons 
  and planets trace their destined paths, where the strong are always the masters 
  of the weak and where those subject to such laws must obey them or be destroyed. 
  Man must also submit to the eternal principles of this supreme wisdom. He may 
  try to understand them but he can never free himself from their sway. p.141</p>
<p>It would be impossible to find a fox which has a kindly and protective disposition 
  towards geese, just as no cat exists which has a friendly disposition towards 
  mice. That is why the struggle between the various species does not arise from 
  a feeling of mutual antipathy but rather from hunger and love. In both cases 
  Nature looks on calmly and is even pleased with what happens. The struggle for 
  the daily livelihood leaves behind in the ruck everything that is weak or diseased 
  or wavering; while the flight of the male to possess the female give to the 
  strongest the right, or at least, the possibility to propagate its kind And 
  this struggle is a means of furthering the health and powers of resistance in 
  the species. Thus it is one of the causes underlying the process of development 
  towards a higher quality of being. p. 161</p>
<h3>The Bible</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Genesis 2:19,20 Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the beasts 
    of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the man to see 
    what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, 
    that was its name. So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of 
    the air and all the beasts of the field. But for Adam no suitable [or corresponding] 
    helper was found.</li>
  <li><big>Deuteronomy 22:10 Do not plow with an ox and a donkey yoked together.</big></li>
  <li>God speaking in Jonah 4:11: &quot;Nineveh has more than a hundred and twenty 
    thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left, and many 
    cattle as well. Should I not be concerned about that great city?&quot;</li>
  <li>Proverbs 12:10 A righteous man cares for the needs of his animal, but the 
    kindest acts of the wicked are cruel.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Current Trends:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>AP poll reported in Columbus Dispatch, Sunday Dec. 3, 1995 p. 5,f.</li>
  <li>- The poll found wide-spread support for beliefs usually associated with 
    a tiny minority of animal rights activists. (see charts)</li>
  <li>- The number of animals used in scientific research has dropped by about 
    half since 1968.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [mainly due to] advances such as cell-culturing 
    and computer-modeling, combined with effects of protesters.</li>
  <li>- More than 500 companies now boast that they don't test their cosmetics 
    or household products on animals.</li>
  <li>- 5.9% of Americans bought hunting licenses in 94 compared to 7.7% in 1975 
    (decrease of 24%) mainly because of increased urbanization and decreased availability 
    of places to hunt.</li>
  <li>Petersen, from Fund for Animals in Silver Spring, MD, &quot;I don't believe 
    any creature is put on this Earth for my benefit, be it a dog, elephant or 
    worm.&quot;</li>

<h1>DYING TO BE WELL:</h1>

<h3>Conversation and Cuisine Background Paper</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>In one way or another we're all familiar with and have been affected in one way or
another by some aspect of the current emphasis in our culture on good health. This
emphasis has moved beyond physical fitness to include all aspects of life--emotional,
mental, interpersonal, and even spiritual well-being. </p>

<p>In this discussion we hope to investigate the modern-day &quot;wellness&quot;
movement--what it is, what it proposes, as well as some of the practical and philosophical
questions it raises. </p>

<p>A variety of views and ideas will be injected into the discussion; many of which come
from widely divergent world views. Along with some of the modern notions of wellness, a
few thoughts from the biblical point of view will be introduced for consideration. </p>

<p>It is not our intent to cover all the bases or reach any definitive conclusions. Our
goal is to stimulate some dialogue which should raise our awareness and perhaps challenge
our preconceived notions about this issue. </p>

<p>Therefore, all views are welcome. We probably won't all agree about everything, but
whatever you have to say is important and welcomed. Feel free to contribute or just take
it all in and consider the issues on your own or in the context of future conversations. </p>

<h3>How Would You Define Wellness?</h3>

<h5>Definitions</h5>

<ul>
  <li>&quot;Wellness . . . is a way of living that stresses taking steps to prevent illness
    and prolong lives. In addition, wellness represents something to strive toward -- the
    optimum state of health and well-being that each individual is capable of achieving, given
    his or her own set of circumstances.&quot;1 </li>
  <li>&quot;In the 1970s, the World Health Organization formulated a definition of health that
    has had great influence on subsequent medical thought. It defined health as a state of
    complete physical, mental, and social well-being. This definition, which also enters the
    spiritual dimension, has been attacked as being too broad to be practical, because it
    includes experiences beyond the realm of medicine and beyond the control of the
    individual.&quot;2 </li>
  <li>&quot;Traditionally, good health has been thought of as simply the absence of illness,
    and preserving health has, for the most part, been entrusted to doctors and the medical
    establishment. Recently, however, a new concept of health care has been evolving -- one
    that involves taking a more active approach to improving and maintaining your overall
    condition. The concept is called wellness, and it refers to a way of living, not a
    specific mode of treatment or formula for good health. </li>
  <li>The central tenet of wellness is that advances in medicine, while certainly beneficial,
    are not sufficient to protect and enhance your health. Rather, good health depends upon a
    wide spectrum of lifestyle habits that range from diet and exercise to managing stress and
    safety precautions. Wellness, in effect, is about those choices that affect your health,
    some of them on a daily basis. This book is a guide to help you choose wisely. By using
    the information in it, you gain two incomparable benefits: you can live longer and also
    increase the quality of your life, achieving an optimal state of physical and mental
    well-being.&quot;3 </li>
  <li>&quot;The first and foremost goal of wellness is preventing illness, especially those
    health problems that can shorten your life.&quot;4 </li>
</ul>

<h3>What's Behind All This? What Are We Really Searching For? </h3>

<h5>New Age/Postmodernism</h5>

<ul>
  <li>&quot;A genuine social movement . . . a product of the occult-psychic-metaphysical
    movement which preceded it, New Age concepts have in turn permeated the metaphysical field
    and have moved beyond it to include the vast domain of alternative medical systems -- in
    particular the holistic health movement.&quot;5 </li>
  <li>&quot;The New Age movement can be defined by its primal experience of transformation.
    New Agers have either experienced or are diligently seeking a profound personal
    transformation from an old, unacceptable life to a new, exciting future. One prominent
    model for that transformation is healing, which has given rise to what is possibly the
    largest identifiable segment of the movement, the Holistic Health Movement.&quot;6 </li>
  <li>&quot;New Agers project the possibility of the transformation of the culture and of
    humanity itself . . . healing projected into the larger social context has become a
    movement to heal the earth.&quot;7 </li>
  <li>&quot;New Age and Holistic Health Movements, in theory, exist independently, but are
    united philosophically by one central theme: the individual person is responsible for
    his/her own life and for seeking out the means of transformation needed to achieve a
    better quality of life.&quot;8 </li>
  <li>'Holism' -- treating the patient instead of the symptom. &quot;A biological concept
    which assumes that living systems, as systems, take on a new dynamic that is more than and
    different from its parts.&quot; 'Human Being' -- total system of body, mind and spirit;
    more than chemistry. And disease is more than the sum of its physical symptoms. 'Health'
    -- a positive state that every individual should strive to achieve. &quot;Holistic
    medicine assumes that humans are part of nature and nature is constantly attempting to
    heal itself.&quot;9 </li>
  <li>&quot;Disease occurs when nature is out of balance or distorted by the introduction of
    artificial, unnatural products. Basic to nature is life and energy. Thus, if the flow of
    life is diverted, blocked, or poisoned, disease will arise. As a result, holistic health
    seeks the means to free nature, life, and universal energies to do their health-producing
    tasks.&quot;10 </li>
  <li>It appears that much of the field of holistic health seeks a more &quot;complete&quot;
    healing than that of traditional medicine. It often taps into the universal energy that
    flows throughout the body and universe, thus affecting not only the physical, but the
    emotional and spiritual as well. </li>
  <li>Scientology is an applied religious philosophy. It could be defined as the &quot;study
    and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself, universes, and other life.&quot;11
    &quot;The end of scientology studies and drills is a renewed awareness of self as a
    spiritual and immortal being.&quot;12 </li>
  <li>In the book, Hubbard defines immortal as not liable or subject to death; undying. </li>
  <li>&quot;The ten new assumptions are: </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>The physical world, including our bodies, is a response of the observer. We create our
    bodies as we create the experience of our world. </li>
  <li>In their essential state, our bodies are composed of energy and information, not solid
    matter. This energy and information is an outcropping of infinite fields of energy and
    information spanning the universe. </li>
  <li>The mind and body are inseparably one. The unity that is &quot;me&quot; separates into
    two streams of experience. I experience the subjective stream as thoughts, feelings, and
    desires. I experience the objective stream as my body. At a deeper level, however, the two
    streams meet at a single creative source. It is from this source that we are meant to
    live. </li>
  <li>The biochemistry of the body is a product of awareness. Beliefs, thoughts, and emotions
    create the chemical reactions that uphold life in every cell. An aging cell is the end
    product of awareness that has forgotten how to remain new. </li>
  <li>Perception appears to be automatic, but in fact it is a learned phenomenon. The world
    you live in, including the experience of your body, is completely dictated by how you
    learned to perceive it. If you change your perception, you change the experience of your
    body and your world. </li>
  <li>Impulses of intelligence create your body in new forms every second. What you are is the
    sum total of these impulses, and by changing their patterns, you will change. </li>
  <li>Although each person seems separate and independent, all of us are connected to patterns
    of intelligence that govern the whole cosmos. Our bodies are part of a universal body, our
    minds an aspect of a universal mind. </li>
  <li>Time does not exist as an absolute, but only eternity. Time is quantified eternity,
    timelessness chopped up into bits and pieces (seconds, hours, days, years) by us. What we
    call linear time is a reflection of how we perceive change. If we could perceive the
    changeless, time would cease to exist as we know it. We can learn to start metabolizing
    non-change, eternity, the absolute. By doing that, we will be ready to create the
    physiology of immortality. </li>
  <li>Each of us inhabits a reality lying beyond all change. Deep inside us, unknown to the
    five senses, is an innermost core of being, a field of non-change that creates
    personality, ego, and body. This being is our essential state--it is who we really are. </li>
  <li>We are not victims of aging, sickness, and death. These are part of the scenery, not the
    seer, who is immune to any form of change. This seer is the spirit, the expression of
    eternal being.&quot;13 </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>&quot;Your body is something far more miraculous--a flowing organism empowered by
    millions of years of intelligence. This intelligence is dedicated to overseeing the
    constant change that takes place inside you. Every cell is a miniature terminal connected
    to the cosmic computer. </li>
  <li>From this perspective, it hardly seems possible that human beings could age at all.14 </li>
  <li>&quot;Aging is a mask for the loss of this intelligence.&quot;15 </li>
  <li>&quot;. . . we must find the control switch that manipulates the body's inner
    intelligence. </li>
  <li>The new reality ushered in by quantum physics made it possible for the first time to
    manipulate the invisible intelligence that underlies the visible world. Einstein taught us
    that the physical body, like all material objects, is an illusion, and trying to
    manipulate it can be like grasping the shadow and missing the substance. The unseen world
    is the real world, and when we are willing to explore the unseen levels of our bodies, we
    can tap in to the immense creative power that lies at our source. Let me expand on the ten
    principles of the new paradigm in light of this hidden potential waiting beneath the
    surface of life.&quot;16 </li>
  <li>Since his debut with Creating Health, Chopra has had three other hits, though none as
    big as Ageless Body, Timeless Mind. Within 24 hours of his appearance on Oprah in July of
    1993, retailers across the country ran out of the book, which has sold 700,000 copies to
    date (Nov., 1993). Numbers like that have some wondering whether Chopra has found the
    fountain of youth or a road to riches. But Chopra says that what sets him apart from the
    rest of the new-age pack is that he can turn the abracadabra of healing into &quot;a
    language that fascinates people.&quot;17 </li>
</ul>

<h5>Longevity</h5>

<ul>
  <li>&quot;In fact, until recently many scientists believed that humans--and most other
    animals--wear out at some predictable age. Even if heart disease and cancer were
    conquered, people would still not live much beyond 85. </li>
  <li>But the latest scientific research challenges this dogma. It reveals that there may be
    not built-in limit to life. And it opens up the possibility of tinkering with the body's
    hormonal systems, or even the genetic code, to stretch human lifespan significantly. . . .
    Instead of slowly declining, people would remain active for virtually their whole lives,
    then perish with their tennis shoes on. . . . So far, researchers have only been able to
    reverse some of the symptoms of aging, but their ultimate goal is to actually increase
    human lifespan. . . . Evolution . . . is primarily concerned with making sure an animal is
    around long enough to reproduce. Anything unfavorable--like death--that happens after an
    animal has raised its children is inconsequential. Put bluntly, animals die because
    there's no reason for them to stay around after they procreate. </li>
  <li>What's worse . . . genetic defects that harm the elderly tend to accumulate over
    generations, like garbage piling up in a dumpster. Why? Because there is no way to breed
    such &quot;trash&quot; genes out of the population. </li>
  <li>. . . Across the country, a large number of researchers and startup companies are taking
    on the problem of aging by betting . . . on biochemicals: hormones, enzymes, brain
    proteins, even aloe vera. The jackpot: finding a chemical that slows one or more aspects
    of aging. </li>
  <li>The odds on any one substance are long, but the stakes are huge. &quot;If people will
    spend $100 billion a year just to make themselves look younger,&quot; says Rose,
    &quot;Imagine how much they will pay for products that actually make them younger.&quot;
    This undeniable logic has lured drug companies and venture capital firms into spending
    millions each year on treating and preventing age-related diseases.&quot;18 </li>
  <li>&quot;Whereas few of us can expect to be longevity superstars, demographic trends show
    that more and more of us will at least make it into the big league. The 'oldest
    old'--those 85 and older--make up the fastest-growing segment of the population in the
    U.S. </li>
  <li>and other prosperous nations. Between 1960 and 1990, while the overall U.S. population
    grew 39%, the ranks of those 85 and older jumped 232%. The U.S. Census Bureau projects
    that by the year 2040, there will be 1.3 million Americans 100 years or older; some
    demographers put the figure at 4 million. </li>
  <li>The oldest old are healthier than the merely old in several respects. Heart disease and
    stroke . . . have their greatest impact in the 50s through 80s for men and 10 years later
    for women. Those who make it past the danger zones are less apt to be stricken at all.
    Similarly, Alzheimer's disease usually picks off its victims by the mid-80s. Perls found
    that men in their 90s outperformed octogenarians in tests of mental function. . . . While
    the chance of dying increases exponentially with each year from 50 to 90, the odds rise
    less steeply after 90. </li>
  <li>. . . although men have a shorter average life-span than women, males who do survive
    into extreme old age tend to be in better shape than women. Men make up 20% of
    100-year-olds and 40% of 105-year-olds. </li>
  <li>[genetics is a factor, as are diet, temperament, life-style and education] Studies
    suggest, on average, better-educated people suffer less mental deterioration in old
    age.&quot;19 </li>
  <li>&quot;A poll the authors cited from the Alliance of Aging Research identified most
    Americans as wanting to live to see their 100th birthday. But nearly 80 percent of those
    polled said they feared ending life in a nursing home more than they feared dying from a
    disease.&quot; </li>
  <li>[Steven] Blair's data showed that people in the low-fit group . . . were three times
    more likely to die from heart disease or cancer than those who were moderately fit . . .
    Looking at total death rates no matter what the cause, Blair saw that the death rate among
    sedentary men was three and a half times higher than that of men who exercised. Among
    women, it was four times higher. </li>
  <li>It is this search for eternal youth that keeps many of us running. And such yearnings
    motivate scientists to try to answer the question of whether or not staying active can
    help you stay fit and healthy for a longer period of time. </li>
  <li>Blair points to research that suggests that aerobic fitness gives people more energy in
    their daily lives. . . . The converse is also true. Blair hypothesizes that decades of
    sedentary living plus the effects of aging produce a cumulative decline in physical
    fitness in people age 75 and older.&quot; 20 </li>
  <li>&quot;For more than a decade, with increasing success, molecular biologists all over the
    world have been struggling to answer a question as old as death: Why do we age and what --
    if anything -- can we do to slow the process down? . . . now envision that within a
    generation or two mankind's maximum life span of 120 years . . . could be extended by
    decades, possibly by centuries. </li>
  <li>. . . dietary restriction . . . [could] give us an extra 30 to 35 years. </li>
  <li>Possibly in 30 years we will have in hand the major genes that determine longevity, and
    will be in a position to double, triple, even quadruple our maximum life span of 120
    years. </li>
  <li>If we're willing to spend enough money on research, and if we spend it intelligently, I
    believe that in 25 years we could see the creation of the first products that can postpone
    human aging significantly. . . . The only practical limit to human life span is the limit
    of human technology. </li>
  <li>With the knowledge that is accumulating now about the nutritional and neuroendocrine
    aspects of aging, and if we develop ways to repair aging tissues with the help of
    embryonic cells, we could add 30 healthy years to human life in the next decade. And
    beyond that, as we learn to control the genes involved in aging, the possibilities of
    lengthening life appear practically unlimited. </li>
  <li>It sounds as if a group of scientific visionaries, taking over where the God of Genesis
    left off, is heralding the dawn of the Eighth Day of Creation -- and in fact they are
    proposing nothing less than a revolt against the one-billion-year tyranny of the genes. </li>
  <li>A telling parallel: After 20 [plus] years of confident forecasts there is still no cure
    for cancer, and aging is a far more complex phenomenon than cancer. . . . 'the most
    complex of all biological problems,' and time has ruthlessly discredited all previous
    so-called solutions. . . . Dr. Steven Harris, 35, a gerontologist and biological
    researcher at UCLA, compares it to a big gray elephant. 'We're pawing at this enormous
    enigma like the blind man in the story. We grasp its side, we say aging is a wall. We
    grasp its trunk, we say aging is a snake. We grasp its leg, we say aging is a tree. We're
    all partly wrong -- and partly right. But every time we grasp something new, our
    understanding of the elephant grows, and we're grasping something new every day. We're
    getting to know the nature of the beast.' </li>
  <li>A scientist in California has identified the genes that make skin age and is now
    researching substances that reverse the process and may open the way to a wrinkle-free
    future for the human race. A team in Dallas found a way to make human cells live up to 100
    percent longer and then figured out another way to make them immortal . . . a discovery
    they believe prefigures the possibility of extending human life span. . . . Treating a
    group of elderly men with a potent hormone, one scientist temporarily reversed some
    symptoms of aging by up to 20 years in less than six months. [And on, and on it goes.]
    'For the first time, after years of evolution, we are on the verge of influencing our
    fate. Nothing, nothing is impossible.' . . . Dr. Vincent Cristofalo, 59, a cell biologist
    at the University of Pennsylvania, insists that 'no magic bullet is going to put an end to
    aging. It's too complex. We may progressively stop certain aspects of aging over the next
    hundred years. We definitely won't stop all of aging in the near future.' Dr. Anna
    McCormick, 43, a molecular biologist at the NIA, warns . . . 'One wrong step and you could
    wind up with a very sick organism.' </li>
  <li>And even if aging could be slowed or stopped, there are those who wonder if it should
    be. Given a birth rate that would hugely exceed the death rate, they foresee a Malthusian
    nightmare, an appalling population explosion that could wreck the world's economy and
    ravage its environment. They also foresee a worldwide social earthquake . . . wall-to-wall
    revolution that would force every human institution through a meat grinder of change and
    demolish civilization in its present form. The brave new world that emerged . . . would be
    a dreary, overcrowded zoo of ancient mutants, a monotonous community of smooth-faced
    Dorian Grays enduring eternal youth on a planet where time no longer ticked and death
    alone offered relief from boredom. </li>

<h3>Cryonics</h3>

<ul>
  <li>&quot;Consider cryonics. This idea, that properly freezing people immediately after they
    have crossed the threshold we call &quot;death&quot; may allow them to be later
    reanimated, is an assertion about the future.&quot; The article points out that the three
    cryonics organizations in existence today face considerable antagonism, much of it quite
    emotional. The antagonism continues as well as widespread views that cryonics is
    inherently wrong, greedy, or else the work of con men. &quot;This fervently felt
    resistance suggests a deep unvarying uneasiness about death in our society. . . . The
    number of people who invest in cryonics as a rational gamble is increasing exponentially.
    Over forty are now suspended in liquid nitrogen, with hundreds signed up to be.&quot; </li>
  <li>&quot;What kind of concerns enter here? . . . First, the metaphysical. To preserve
    people's minds, we naturally think of saving their brains. What are the chances that the
    brain carries the mind?&quot; </li>
  <li>&quot;Next, what are the odds that our brain structure tells the whole story? That is,
    that your Self is not the product of continuing electrical activity in the brain.&quot; </li>
  <li>&quot;Finally, there is a chance that your Self can make it through the process of being
    frozen down to liquid nitrogen temperatures. &quot;22 </li>
  <li>What are the chances for survival of your brain? What are the chances society will make
    it for a century? What if my cryonic organization fails? </li>
  <li>The author figures the chances of making are between 1 and 30%. He ponders what the
    future would be like without all that we have and love now. </li>
  <li>What if there is an afterlife? Well, cryonics hedges the bet that there is no afterlife.
  </li>
  <li>&quot;Cryonics is the ultimate gesture of defiance. Even if it offers only one chance in
    a hundred thousand, that chance is worth taking. Death is intolerable, and I am seizing
    the only available opportunity to transcend it.&quot;23 </li>
  <li>&quot;Cryonics is affordable to almost anyone who can take out a life-insurance policy.
    Typically, the total cost of insurance plus membership in a cryonics organization is under
    $1000 per year. For more information . . . contact Alcor at (800) 367-2228.&quot;24 </li>

<h3>What Are Some of the Financial Implications of the Movement? </h3>

<h5>Wellness and Business</h5>

<ul>
  <li>In 1993, over 2000 chaplains were employed by large corporations to be available to
    minister to their employees. &quot;That type of position offers tremendous potential in
    the workplace. It's very creative in the area of wellness to have someone on the scene who
    can deal with the emotional needs -- and maybe the spiritual needs of employees. So many
    people are hungering to be listened to and also hungering for the spiritual elements of
    life.&quot;25 </li>
  <li>&quot;Here's what small companies are offering: <ul>
      <li>Alcohol and drug policy 85% </li>
      <li>Smoking restrictions 55 </li>
      <li>Exercise/fitness program 33 </li>
      <li>Stress-management education 29 </li>
      <li>Back-care information/activities 28 </li>
      <li>Weight-management information 27 </li>
      <li>High-blood-pressure information/activities 23 </li>
      <li>HIV and STD information/activities 23 </li>
      <li>Nutrition education 22 </li>
      <li>Information/activities pertaining to off-the-job accidents 14 </li>
      <li>Cholesterol screenings 10 </li>
      <li>Cancer screenings 6 </li>
      <li>Prenatal education 5&quot;26 </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>&quot;An increasing number of insurance companies and private corporations are taking
    aggressive measures to offset rising medical costs by offering substantial discounts,
    savings and outright dividends to clients and employees who vow to stay fit. </li>
  <li>Why? It is good business. Each year, companies spend as much as $109 billion on employee
    medical services and prescription drugs and lose an estimated $18.2 billion because of
    lost productivity due to costly ailments such as diabetes, lung cancer and stroke. They
    hope to change their sagging bottom lines, low productivity figures and how their
    employees view fitness by offering corporate fitness programs and monetary incentives. . .
    . [Hershey] pays employees who maintain adequate fitness levels as much as $14 a month in
    benefit credits. . . . those employees with physical conditions &quot;brought on by
    unhealthy living&quot; pay penalties. . . . [at Hershey] those who refuse to exercise and
    suffer from high blood pressure and cholesterol levels lose up to $70 in company-allocated
    benefits. . . . The company is trying to make sure that people are healthy at home and on
    the job.&quot;27 </li>
  <li>&quot;So what is company 'wellness?' It isn't just about jogging five miles before work
    or eating chicken with the skin removed. When you get right down to it, company wellness
    is about 'productivity.' . . . Many growing companies -- and their enterprising owners --
    are trying to get a grip on both the fiscal and physical benefits of 'wellness,' and with
    good reason. Consider these facts: </li>
  <li>Heart disease costs this country $52.4 billion a year: that's $14 billion in direct
    health care, $3 billion in lost workdays and $34 billion in future earnings. </li>
  <li>Smoking costs . . . more than $52 billion a year . . . </li>
  <li>Misuse of alcohol and drugs . . . $100 billion a year . . . </li>
  <li>Seven out of ten American workers say job stress is causing frequent health problems and
    46% rate their jobs 'highly stressful.' . . . </li>
  <li>Depression costs . . . $43.7 billion . . . </li>
  <li>Lower back pain . . . $20 billion. </li>
  <li>No wonder that health care has taken the front-burner position as the #1 domestic issue
    today. The costs are spiraling out of control. In fact, charges for hospitals and doctors
    are rising three times the rate of inflation and are equal to 15% of the total gross
    domestic product. . . . With medical costs now consuming as much as 50% of corporate
    profits, by the end of the next decade, medical benefits will consume all corporate
    profits. . . . the corporate payoff in terms of lifestyle changes and dollars saved is a
    profitable venture. . . . Now, some companies are refusing to hire smokers. . . . </li>
  <li>There is no doubt that wellness in the workplace programs are helping employers contain
    costs and helping employees make voluntary lifestyle changes which reduce their health
    risks and enhance their individual productivity. . . . Wellness is our future.&quot;28 </li>
  <li>&quot;In an effort to control health-care costs, many businesses are setting up rules to
    improve their employees' health--whether or not the employees want to be improved. Some
    even extend the rules to spouses of employees. Examples: <ul>
      <li>Company A won't hire smokers because it claims they have more illnesses than nonsmokers,
        and a high claims rate is sending its health insurance premiums through the roof. It tests
        its workers' urine, discovers nicotine in one worker's sample and fires him just for
        indulging in a legal activity on his own time. </li>
      <li>Company B is a 24-hour trucking firm worried about increasingly high accident rates. It
        sets new rules prohibiting off-hours drinking. Now the personnel manager gets anonymous
        notes reporting who was seen at what bar Saturday night. </li>
      <li>Company C decides anyone more than 20% overweight is a financial liability, must lose
        weight and start exercising--or else. . . . So companies figure they can lower costs by
        dictating life style changes. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Instead of punishing smokers or couch potatoes, . . . companies are rewarding employees
    with good life style habits. One company pays 85% of insurance premiums for its employees,
    increasing that to 90% for those who avoid higher-risk behaviors. Some companies lower the
    deductible; some offer better benefits packages. To make the decisions, some use
    questionnaires to collect the information and work on the honor system; others, usually
    larger companies, require medical examinations. In some cases, companies reward employees
    with direct payments: $10 for each excess pound lost and kept off; $500 to quit smoking;
    bonus payment for each sick day not taken. </li>
  <li>Using a positive approach to keeping employees healthy also can help you avoid
    litigation. More and more states are enacting laws prohibiting discrimination against
    employees who indulge in legal off-the-job activities. As such rules become more
    widespread, rewards for healthy behavior probably will outlast penalties for unhealthy
    behavior.&quot;29 </li>
</ul>

<h3>When Is Enough, Enough? Is More Really Better?</h3>

<h5>Wellness Mania</h5>

<ul>
  <li>&quot;We know that growing numbers of Americans are utterly hooked on bodily perfection.
    Witness one respondent in a focus group in California who admitted to drinking eight pints
    of Evian every night between going to bed and getting up! The phenomenal growth of health
    and fitness clubs across the US further endorses the belief of perfect health followed by
    all ages from teenagers to octogenarians.&quot;30 </li>
  <li>Lodge argues that the new-age health and fitness fad sweeping across the industrialized
    world, especially in the US, has resulted in the phenomenal growth in business for fitness
    clubs and health foods. He also contends that the downside of too much concern for
    physical health is that people develop a negative attitude towards growing old. Moreover,
    the new age fad, like most fads, is bound to go out of fashion and be taken over by a new
    fad which promotes what the previous ones had tried to eschew. </li>
  <li>The Ashram is a spa that is geared toward weight loss and physical fitness. Celebrities
    and others pay $2,100 a week to be fed an 800-calorie diet and spend their days going on
    strenuous hikes and doing yoga. The program also includes massage therapy and hot
    tubbing.31 </li>
  <li>According to reports in the British tabloids, Princess Diana has amassed fashion and
    beauty bills of around $240,000 a year. This goes to pay hairdressers; buy clothes,
    skin-care products and new-age wellness treatments like aromatherapy.32 </li>
</ul>

<h5>Excessiveness</h5>

<ul>
  <li>&quot;So increasingly I wondered if it was possible that excessive exercise might not
    only be unnecessary, but might even be harmful--so harmful that my own physical training
    philosophy and recommendations should be altered. Given my previous efforts to promote the
    acceptance of regular exercise as a prerequisite to good health, I believed that these
    were landmark issues that had to be resolved.&quot;33 </li>
  <li>&quot;But a paradox has emerged. It is now necessary to question the claim if something
    is good, more is even better. A prevalent assumption, which we now must challenge, is that
    the more oxygen your lungs and heart can process, the healthier you will be. In other
    words, is it possible to be fit but unhealthy? </li>
  <li>Those questions have been transformed into convictions as research has emerged showing
    clearly that not all oxygen is good oxygen. Indeed, we now know that a number of
    environmental factors and seemingly beneficial health habits--including exercise to
    excess--can harm our health by triggering the release in the body of unstable oxygen
    molecules known as 'free radicals.'&quot;34 </li>
  <li>&quot;The key to the effective and safe operation of free radicals in your body is
    balance, but the problem is that the delicately balanced mechanisms frequently get out of
    whack. To correct the situation, your body produces free radical scavengers--known as
    'endogenous antioxidants'--which gobble up the extra free radicals and prevent them from
    damaging your body. </li>
  <li>Some antioxidants that we take in from the outside through our diets help to bolster our
    defenses against excessive numbers of free radicals. The most important of those outside
    (or 'exogenous') antioxidants are vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta carotene.&quot;35 </li>
  <li>&quot;In humans, breathing pure oxygen for as short a period as six hours caused chest
    soreness, coughing, and sore throats--and longer periods of exposure could destroy the air
    cells in the lungs. . . . four extremely destructive forms of oxygen have been identified.
    Two of them--the hydroxyl radical and the superoxide radical--are true free radicals in
    that they have an unpaired electron in a molecular orbit. Two other renegade forms of the
    oxygen molecule, known as 'non-radical reactive oxygen species,' can also do significant
    damage to the body. Labeled the oxygen singlet and hydrogen peroxide, these forms of
    oxygen, along with the two free radicals, are the main enemies we will be fighting through
    the various practical programs described in this book.&quot;36 </li>
  <li>&quot;. . . Lester Parker, a biochemist at the University of California at Berkeley, . .
    . and others have determined that free radicals benefit the body by working with the
    immune system to ward off disease by killing alien bacteria and other invaders that enter
    your body. Also, they help regulate the contraction of the smooth muscles of your blood
    vessels and contribute to the control of your blood flow by influencing the tone of the
    tissue lining of your vessels. </li>
  <li>Free radicals are released during the normal metabolism of your body, as your food is
    turned into energy by your body's cells. . . . The problem arises when too many free
    radicals are generated for your internal antioxidant police force. When that happens, the
    radicals become renegades.&quot;37 </li>
  <li>&quot;In evaluating more than one thousand Swedes, researchers compared medical
    histories and questionnaires, which focused on important life events during a ten-year
    period. They found that serious work-related problems made a person five times more likely
    to develop colo-rectal cancer and that unemployment of more than six months doubled the
    cancer risk. In addition, those who moved more than 120 miles had nearly three times the
    risk of cancer. Divorce or a spouse's death increased cancer risk by 50 percent. The exact
    reasons for the apparent relationship between stress and cancer are unknown, but the
    increased free radical production that can result from stress may be the answer.&quot;38 </li>
  <li>&quot;Exhausting, high-intensity exercise may increase your susceptibility to different
    cancers, heart attacks, cataracts, premature aging, decreased immunity, and a variety of
    other medical problems. </li>
  <li>What is the evidence for this charge that I am leveling against high-intensity exercise
    programs? . . . According to a report in 1986 in The New England Journal of Medicine, . .
    . death rates were lower for men who were involved in regular physical activity than for
    men who were not. The death rates declined steadily as the number of calories they burned
    per week increased. In fact, the rate of death was one-fourth to one-third lower among men
    expending two thousand or more calories per week, as compared with the less active men--a
    finding that translates to an estimated increase in life span of 2.4 years. </li>
  <li>But at the highest intensity levels, exercise seemed to be less beneficial. The rates of
    death began to go up slightly among men expending more than three thousand calories per
    week. . . . The rate of death slopes downward at first as exercise intensity goes up. But
    when the intensity of physical conditioning reaches its highest pitch, the death rate goes
    up slightly. . . . there was a slight increase in the death rate from all causes among
    women who were engaging in the heaviest workouts.&quot;39 </li>

<ul>
  <li><i>Fitness,</i> March/April, 1995. See the insert on p. 109 entitled &quot;Deep
    cleaning: enemas and colonics.&quot; </li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Many ritualistic fasters--particularly for fasts lasting more than 24 hours--also
give themselves enemas to stave off constipation and cleanse the colon, which they believe
is impacted with fecal matter. Some may undergo 'colon irrigations,' or 'colonics.' A kind
of superefficient enema, the most popular colonic involves inserting a device into the
rectum with valves to flush water in and out. A practitioner massages the abdomen during
the half-hour procedure, until the water runs out clear. The colonic is performed before,
during and after a fast. </p>

<p>Detractors object to enemas and colonics for both physical and psychological reasons.
'There's the physical risk of perforating the bowel or--because you've usurped its
function--causing it to shut down altogether,' says C. Wayne Callaway, M.D., of George
Washington University. 'But underlying the behavior is a kind of troubling ideology: In
the absence of a clearly defined illness, are we so arrogant that we can outsmart our body
and assume that we can do its job better?'&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Today meditation is being embraced by mainstream health experts as a major weapon
in promoting good health, well-being and even physical fitness. In fact, some predict that
combining meditation with exercise is the workout direction of the future--a powerful way
of maximizing the emotional benefits that accompany exercise. </p>

<p>. . . the linking of body and mind in the field of physical exercise will be one of hte
most important areas of research in the next 10 years. . . . </p>

<p>Although there is no scientific proof yet, some researchers believe meditation may
promote long-term good health even more effectively than exercise.&quot;40 </p>

<p>&quot;Certain kinds of exercise . . . are rooted in the practice of meditation. They
emphasize calmness, fluidity of movement and concentration on the moment.&quot;41 </p>

<h5>Local Programs</h5>

<p>&quot;Since the Elizabeth Blackwell Center opened its doors in 1985, its mission has
been to improve access to health care for everyone -- especially women. For the Blackwell
Center, 'health' was defined in much broader; nontraditional terms: not just physical, but
mental and social well-being. </p>

<p>Today, as researchers discover more about the mind/body connection, that definition has
won acceptance by many within and outside health care. And the Blackwell Center continues
to innovate the programs and services that it has been offering for 10 years. </p>

<p>'Fibromyalgia/Hatha Yoga' -- A discussion of the symptoms, causes and treatment of this
increasingly common problem characterized by fatigue, muscle aches and sleeping problems.

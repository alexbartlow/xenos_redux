      <h1><font color="#660000">Lay Counseling</font></h1>
      <p><b>By Dennis McCallum </b></p>
      <h3><font color="#990000">The Nature of Lay Counseling</font></h3>
      <p>Because troubled people have different levels of need, there is definitely 
        a place for the highly trained professional clinical counselor. For many, 
        nothing less than a medically trained therapist is needed. On the other 
        hand, there are many people who would respond positively to counseling 
        from a trained lay counselor, especially if medical professionals are 
        consulted at the same time. </p>
      <p>Lay counselors are needed for several reasons. In the first place, professionals 
        are typically quite busy, and do not always have time to work extensively 
        with non-clinical cases. Unfortunately, even psychotic clients must sometimes 
        be returned to the streets after receiving little more than drug therapy. 
      </p>
      <p>Secondly, the cost of professional counseling services is prohibitive 
        to many. This has the effect of making counseling help unavailable to 
        any but the wealthy or those with insurance. Of course, there are governmental 
        funds available for the mentally disabled. But often those requiring counseling 
        are not disabled, and therefore not eligible for funds. Such people may 
        just need some teaching or advice on how to respond to their problems. 
      </p>
      <p>Thirdly, there are many people who want to understand their problems 
        in the context of the Christian world-view. Although there are clinical 
        professionals in every large city who are Christians, they are usually 
        even more in demand than secular counselors. </p>
      <p>Finally, the lay counselor can have frequent contact with the individual. 
        Typically, professional counseling sessions are limited to periodic one-hour 
        sessions. The lay counselor, on the other hand, can provide instruction 
        and then observe how the individual responds. Consequently, feedback is 
        more immediate and the lay counselor has the opportunity to provide encouragement 
        or correction closer to the observed behavior.</p>
      <p>We should also note that the Bible calls upon the local church to train 
        its members in providing primary counseling services. For instance, Rom. 
        15:14 and Col. 3:16 both use the Greek words <em>noutheteo </em>and <em>didasko 
        </em>(admonish, counsel, or instruct) as applying to average members of 
        the local church. The objection could be raised that an arrangement suited 
        to the first century is no longer adequate for the problems of modern 
        society, and that the counseling profession has rendered lay counseling 
        unnecessary. Of course, there were no professional counselors (in the 
        modern sense) in ancient society, and thus no option but lay counseling. 
        On the other hand, principles of biblical living are applicable to all 
        ages if adapted correctly. It is therefore reasonable to expect considerable 
        lay counseling activity in a healthy local church. </p>
      <p>Several steps are necessary if such a counseling ministry is to be developed. 
        <em>First</em>, the needs of people in the group should be divided into 
        those needs which can probably be handled by lay counselors from those 
        which will require the attention of a health professional. Lay counselors 
        will need to be taught to tell the difference. <em>Secondly</em>, suitable 
        lay counselors will need to be trained to identify specific behavior and 
        attitude patterns that they understand and to which they can match helpful 
        therapy. <em>Finally</em>, a definite plan of communication will be needed. 
        This paper deals with the first two issues.</p>
      <h3><font color="#990000">Clinical and Non-Clinical Cases</font></h3>
      <p>If lay counselors are to avoid causing damage in people's lives, it is 
        essential that they be able to tell which cases require professional attention. 
        In this area it would clearly be best to err on the side of caution, since 
        some conditions will deteriorate if not tended to. It is important that 
        the lay counselor sees the professional therapist as an ally, not an enemy. 
        There are cases, especially in fundamentalist circles, where professional 
        counselors have been viewed with suspicion because of their secular theories 
        and the profit motive. This is a good reason for the church to obtain 
        the services of an acceptable Christian counselor for the purposes of 
        consultation. Lay counselors need to be trained to welcome the input of 
        the professional therapist, and to view it as necessary in many cases. 
      </p>
      <p>Among situations calling for consultation are: 
      </p><ul>
        <li>Suicidal ideation </li>
        <li>Schizophrenia </li>
        <li>Clinical depression </li>
        <li>Mania </li>
        <li>Situations involving violence, including child abuse </li>
        <li>Some anxiety disorders </li>
        <li>Personality disorders </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Papers have been written describing each of these situations for the 
        lay counselor. [See Amy Merker, M.D., <a href="../../essays/psych.htm">&quot;Recognizing 
        Emotional Disorders, When to Refer for Professional Help,&quot;</a>&nbsp; 
        It should be studied carefully. The first question in any new counseling 
        situation is that of feasibility. The lay counselor has to know when she 
        has met her match.</p>
      <h3><font color="#990000">Identifying and Treating Specific Behaviors</font></h3>
      <p>When it is determined that a person does not require professional help, 
        the lay counselor can begin to seek solutions. Before anyone can effectively 
        treat problems, there must be a way to understand patterns of human behavior. 
        Unless there is a theoretic that allows the counselor to prioritize issues, 
        she swims in a shoreless ocean of detail. In this ocean, isolated behaviors 
        and attitudes are identified and confronted without anyway of determining 
        which ones are serious and which ones are not. As a result, the counseling 
        tends to be haphazard, ineffective, and frustrating for both counselor 
        and client. </p>
      <p>In order to identify patterns of behavior and evaluate the overall effect 
        of those patterns on the well-being of the client, it may be correct to 
        consider types of personality as one component of the question. Personality 
        typing is simply the process of observing different types of behaviors 
        and identifying categories into which those behaviors fall. These categories 
        (or types) will form patterns or tendencies in some cases. Such patterns 
        emerge finally as a loose description of a personality type. </p>
      <p>If we are able to recognize personality tendencies, we may be able to 
        form an idea of general directions in which various personality types 
        should move. </p>
      <p>A personality type is not a behavioral straight-jacket, but a general 
        description created in light of the knowledge that behaviors often tend 
        to appear in groupings or patterns. These patterns can be assigned names 
        which will enable the counselor to begin the process of conceptualizing 
        the inclinations of others. We all have referred to someone we know as&quot;short-tempered.&quot; 
        Such a description should not be understood to mean that this short-tempered 
        person never has any patience. No doubt he shows patience in some situations. 
        Nevertheless, this does not render the designation &quot;short-tempered&quot; 
        meaningless or immoral. The fact is that some people are <i>relatively 
        </i>short-tempered, which means that in general, they manifest anger externally 
        more quickly than the average person. </p>
      <p>Other common descriptions might include &quot;shy,&quot;&quot;friendly,&quot; 
        &quot;talkative,&quot; &quot;mean,&quot; &quot;docile,&quot; etc. Each 
        of these words describe more than one specific behavior. In fact, each 
        one describes an entire collection of behaviors which more or less frequently 
        are found in certain people. Other people might manifest the same behaviors, 
        but more rarely. We could also gather behaviors together into even larger 
        categories in some cases. For instance, one might observe that those who 
        are shy also tend to be more sensitive. Shyness and sensitivity point 
        to entirely different behaviors even though they are often connected in 
        cause or result. </p>
      <p>It may even be possible to describe larger categories which include whole 
        complexes of behaviors. For instance we might take someone who is talkative, 
        friendly, humorous, loud, restless, demonstrative, short tempered, and 
        aggressive, and call him&quot;extroverted.&quot; The word extrovert does 
        not refer to any specific behavior, but to a rather large collection of 
        behaviors. The value of such large categories is that it may be possible 
        to predict kindred behaviors which might be helpful in understanding the 
        person. Also, it should be easier to avoid simply curtailing one negative 
        behavior by shifting to another in the event that we know other likely 
        problem areas in advance. The client can be put on guard to watch for 
        their own tendencies, thus leading in the direction of self-counseling. 
      </p>
      <p>The exact way that these similar personality types are described is unimportant, 
        as long as the description is relevant to the counseling needs of the 
        person. Several attempts to characterize personality patterns have been 
        made. The Taylor Johnson Personality Inventory, Meyers and Briggs' book, 
        <i>Please Understand Me</i>, and the <i>Minnesota Multiphasic Personality 
        Inventory </i>all attempt to create useful generalizations about personality 
        types. In some fundamentalist circles, the four-fold ancient Greek evaluation 
        of personality types has been revived and elaborated with some success. 
        A less well-known system used for generalizing behavior and affective 
        tendencies is that defined by Dr. Ralph Ankenman of Columbus, Ohio. Ankenman 
        calls his system of diagnosis and treatment &quot;<a href="luvthpy.htm">Love Therapy</a>.&quot; </p>

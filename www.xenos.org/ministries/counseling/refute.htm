      <h1>Response to a Counselor's Paper on Clients and Authority Figures</h1>
      <p>By <a href="../../personal/den.htm">Dennis McCallum</a></p>
      <p><b>September 20, 1992</b></p>
      <p><i>[In 1992 and 1993, Xenos suffered a prolonged conflict over issues 
        involved in counseling. In an effort to resolve the conflict the elders 
        and counselors in the church convened a colloquium to study the issues 
        involved. They discovered that they held substantially different perspectives 
        on the issues of truth, feelings, healing, and possible leadership abuse. 
        One counselor wrote a paper arguing that clients who feel abused will 
        not be healed unless the leaders involved admit their error and show remorse. 
        But here was rub. Leaders were being accused by members of their home 
        groups, but explicitly denied the charges in many cases. Some elders felt 
        the counselors were out of line for always accepting client's claims of 
        abuse as true. In this paper, the question of whether or not leaders were 
        actually guilty was explicitly put down as unimportant. The counselor 
        argued that leaders should simply be willing to be falsely accused and 
        show remorse accordingly for the sake of healing the client. He recounted 
        cases were counselors summoned leaders to meet with clients for reconciliation 
        but would not admit their fault, thus becoming self protective. This response 
        summarized my feelings about a problem besetting many churches today&#8212;<b>the 
        therapeutic perspective which considers the client's memories as &#8220;reality&#8221; 
        whether the events actually occurred or not</b>. This view holds that 
        we can never know what happened in the past, so that question is unimportant. 
        As such, this perspective touches on the whole area of <a href="../crossroads/pmandyou.htm">postmodern 
        views of counseling and history</a>. It also touches on recent debates 
        over church abuse literature, which often employs the therapeutic perspective. 
        For the most part, the claims made in the counselor's paper should be 
        clear from my comments. For the sake of anonymity, I have called the author(who 
        later left this church) &quot;the counselor&quot; in this edition of the 
        paper.]</i> </p>
      <p>The counselor has given us some descriptions of &quot;roles&quot; typically 
        followed by victimized clients and their victimizing leaders. Since writing 
        this paper, he has sent out another memo which I have read along with 
        Gary DeLashmutt's response. I was glad to see that the counselor did not 
        feel that the clients he is seeing fall into the category of &quot;abuse&quot; 
        victims, but his description does make it clear that they are nevertheless 
        viewed as victims in some sense. I felt that Gary's response is important, 
        and raises questions that need to be answered. </p>
      <p>My comments, which are my own, and not those of the other elders, will 
        be directed to the paper named above. </p>
      <p>I am disturbed by some of the things in this paper. The main problem 
        I would like to discuss is the sense in this paper that leaders of clients 
        who come to the counselor are either guilty of the actions with which 
        the clients charge them, or that the issue of guilt or innocence is unimportant. 
        I have to reject either one of these conclusions.</p>
      <p>In a paper I wrote earlier in response to another counselor's paper, 
        I suggested that there are at least three important constraints that we 
        must respect as we attempt to effect healing in any of our clients or 
        other members. I will repeat them here. 
      </p><ol>
        <li>We must avoid committing additional acts of abuse, which may make 
          the cure just as bad as the disease. </li>
        <li>We must effect recovery without denying the truths of our faith or 
          the facts of history. </li>
        <li>We may not do anything that is morally wrong in the hope of correcting 
          moral wrongs from the past. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>I want to press for acceptance of these constraints once again, because 
        based on my reading of the counselor's comments, I am not sure we share 
        these convictions.</p>
      <p>I would like to point out several points in the paper where it would 
        appear that the counselor may not be operating within these constraints. 
      </p><ol>
        <li>At the bottom of page 1, the counselor outlines the three possible 
          roles he sees for leaders in one of these conflicts to assume. They 
          are: Denial, Conditional Admission, or Agent of healing. Unfortunately, 
          as his later comments make clear, all of these roles assume that the 
          leader(s) is guilty of harming the client. How can we assume this? Why 
          isn't there more concern that we may harm one of our leaders by this 
          assumption? (constraint #1) Why aren't we more concerned about what 
          the facts of history are? (constraint #2) </li>
        <li>The counselor sees leaders assuming the deficient role of &quot;historian&quot; 
          when accused of wrong-doing. The historian &quot;attempts, through the 
          assembly of existing evidence and the recollection of themselves and 
          others, to establish 'what really happened.'&quot; The counselor sees 
          the role of historian as &quot;self protection,&quot; &quot;self-serving,&quot; 
          seeking &quot;acquittal&quot; and as having goals that are &quot;not 
          biblical.&quot; Their approach is described as &quot;destructive&quot; 
          and &quot;unproductive.&quot; (all on p. 2) The role of historian is 
          also equated with the term &quot;denial.&quot; It appears that an attempt 
          to discover &quot;what really happened&quot; constitutes a selfish and 
          sinful attitude, destined only to ruin the healing process.<br />
          <br />
          I find this position incomprehensible. How can it be selfish or sinful 
          to discover the truth? In our definition of abuse, we determined that 
          the word &quot;objectifiable&quot; belonged in the definition in order 
          to rule out subjectivity. Here it seems like any attempt to rule out 
          subjectivity is self-protective. The counselor complains that the historian 
          is &quot;unable or unwilling to absorb some initial unjust accusation&quot; 
          and therefore &quot;can not play a significant role in the healing process.&quot; 
          If we accept this proposition, we are directly rejecting my suggested 
          constraint #2, because we are prepared to deny the facts of history. 
          We will probably also violate constraint #1.<br />
          <br />
          I think the facts of the situation are exactly what we need to deal 
          with. The suggestion that the facts don't matter is unbiblical. I would 
          like to point out that going back to the history of a conflict to defend 
          oneself from false accusation is exactly what the apostle Paul does 
          in I Cor. 3:6-4:7; II Cor. 6-12; and Gal. 2. God also does so in passages 
          like Mal. 3:1-4 and Job. 38-40. Notice God's questions of Job: &quot;Will 
          the faultfinder content with the almighty? Let him who reproves God 
          answer it.&quot; (40:2) Also, &quot;Will you condemn me that you might 
          be justified?&quot; 40:8). God was arguing that he had done no wrong, 
          and that Job was projecting blame on him unjustly. Instead of patting 
          Job on the back, God confronted his sinful emotional strategy. Many 
          of the prophets contain similar disputes between God and his people 
          who have forgotten the facts of the situation. Jesus asks, &quot;Which 
          one of you convicts me of sin?&quot; (Jn. 8:46)<br />
          <br />
          As I understand it, the notion of self-protectiveness, as developed 
          by Crabb, refers to situations where people distance themselves from 
          relationships in order to avoid pain. I don't believe he would say it 
          is wrong to defend your innocence if you are accused of rape, for instance. 
          This is not what self-protectiveness means. When someone's reputation 
          is brought under question, they have a right to defend themselves, and 
          this is biblical.<br />
          <br />
          The suggestion that leaders who seek to establish the facts are in the 
          flesh deprives our leaders of the protection of the truth. It reminds 
          me of the situation during the Medieval period in Europe. During the 
          inquisition, nothing more than an accusation of witchcraft or heresy 
          was necessary for the inquisitors to arrest suspects, who were then 
          tortured and often subjected to trials by ordeal which were impossible 
          to pass. Historians have proven that some people were accused and killed 
          for no reason other than the fact that the accuser hated them or wanted 
          their property. Since then, society has moved toward a presumption of 
          innocence in order to assure fairness. An accusation is not sufficient 
          reason to conclude someone is guilty. I am picking an extreme case on 
          purpose, so that we will be able to see the principle. <br />
          <br />
          I want us to agree that we will require authentic evidence of wrong-doing 
          before we adopt the belief that leaders are guilty. This includes accusing 
          them of denial.<br />
          <br />
          The Bible states that elders must be &quot;just.&quot; (Tit. 1:8) I 
          take this to mean that we are obligated to be fair in our dealings. 
          Otherwise, we are in danger of committing abuse against innocent servants 
          of God who are accepting added exposure to danger by trying to lead 
          the church. I think we can also make a distinction here between believing 
          someone is guilty and having suspicions. We may harbor suspicion, but 
          fairness dictates that we not reach a verdict unless there is evidence.<br />
          <br />
          The counselor points out that people remember things differently. This 
          is true, but there are other ways to determine the truth, including 
          third parties and material evidence. The counselor's illustration, where 
          he liked the weekend at the in-laws and his wife didn't, is not analogous. 
          This illustration refers to personal taste, which is not an issue here. 
          To be truly analogous, he would have to be claiming that the weekend 
          at the in-laws was good, and his wife would have to be denying that 
          they ever went to the in-laws! It is not people's emotional reactions 
          to events that I am questioning here, but the events themselves. The 
          one is subjective, the other is objective.<br />
          <br />
          I would like to point out that not only this paper, but the counselor's 
          other memo, and earlier papers all fail to consider the possibility 
          of innocent leaders. For instance, the counselor says being a historian 
          leads to &quot;unproductive questions such as 'was it abuse, or just 
          stupidity?'&quot; I submit that his question is not unimportant or unproductive, 
          but I also wonder why the other question isn't also being asked. It 
          seems that only two possibilities are present--stupidity or abuse. What 
          about the possibility of the leader being innocent? This is not saying 
          that leaders <b>are </b>innocent. But how can we claim that we are fair 
          if we are unwilling to consider this possibility?<br />
          <br />
          It may be that the counselor is not necessarily denying that leaders 
          are innocent, he is only saying that this doesn't matter. Actually, 
          analysis of the paper reveals that both assumptions are present: that 
          leaders <b>are </b>guilty and that the question of innocence <b>doesn't 
          matter</b>. I think it does matter, as my illustration of a man accused 
          of rape demonstrates. Why do we think Paul tells Timothy not to receive 
          an accusation against an elder unless it is by two or more witnesses? 
          (I Tim. 5:19) This restriction applies to elders, but there is also 
          a principle here. It is well-known that people often accuse leaders, 
          and we need an environment where leaders feel that they will be treated 
          fairly.<br />
          <br />
          The counselor's analogy of the traffic accident where a pedestrian is 
          hit by a car is also not analogous. He points out that the question 
          of whether the driver is at fault will not help the wounded pedestrian 
          heal his wounds. True, and it would be fine if neither party lodged 
          accusations, but only focused on healing. However, The counselor is 
          prepared to allow the pedestrian to accuse, but not the driver. In fact 
          by &quot;absorbing baseless blame,&quot; it appears that only if the 
          driver admits he is at fault can he play a role in healing. Why do we 
          think police take accident information at the scene? Also, if the parties 
          are not discussing fault, or the history of what happened, why do we 
          need a joint counseling session with both leader and client? </li>
        <li>I am particularly distressed that the counselor claims that he &quot;kicks 
          the beans out of&quot; leaders who are adopting a posture he labels 
          as self-protective. I hope this is hyperbole. Let me make my position 
          clear: the counselors in this church are not authorized to kick the 
          beans out of leaders or anyone else. If you, as a counselor, have a 
          problem with a leader in this church, you should take that up with an 
          elder. I would also like to have a list of leaders who have received 
          this treatment. This appears to be a clear violation of constraint # 
          3. </li>
        <li>I am wondering if the counselor may be involved in unethical failure 
          to report wrong-doing in this church. I would like to know who the leaders 
          are who are &quot;in complete denial&quot; (p.4 top). If there are leaders 
          involved in wrong-doing in this church, and who are denying that wrong-doing, 
          a counselor is morally obligated to report this to the elders. Counselors 
          do not have the option of ignoring a situation like this, or handling 
          it off the record. I am disturbed that the counselor and some of his 
          clients have concluded that &quot;there is nothing else they can do&quot; 
          because a leader &quot;refuses to cooperate.&quot; This situation is 
          intolerable, and is against our policy.<br />
          <br />
          The counselor also claims that he and his clients are assessing &quot;the 
          destruction currently taking place as a result of the authority figures 
          (sic) continued actions.&quot; He is then helping them &quot;make the 
          determination regarding the level of contact and/or the termination 
          of contact [with the leader].&quot; (p.4 top) I presume this refers 
          to deciding to leave the church. I am startled to think that any staff 
          member would be involved in decisions like this without reporting it 
          to the proper authorities. How are we to lead a church if unrepentant 
          wrong-doing by our leaders is not being reported? Isn't the counselor 
          a co-conspirator with the perpetrator of wrong-doing if he fails to 
          disclose what he knows, especially when we work explicitly under a policy 
          of waived confidentiality for exactly this reason?<br />
          <br />
          I would like to point out that the option of &quot;termination of contact&quot; 
          is not open to leaders. I imagine that a number of leaders would like 
          to terminate contact with one or two people they know. But we insist 
          that they resist this urge in order to avoid wrongly &quot;shunning&quot; 
          people in their group. A leader would have to get the approval of the 
          elders before they could &quot;terminate contact&quot; with someone 
          from their group through legitimate church discipline. </li>
        <li>The counselor's section on the person in authority as a healing agent 
          continues the scenario developed already. He appears to advocate denying 
          the truth of history in order to heal clients (constraint #2). He states 
          that leaders are to &quot;encourage the client to express their feelings 
          and their experiences without judging, correcting, or condemning. Rather, 
          they express genuine remorse, love and concern.&quot; (p. 4 bottom) 
          the expression of &quot;remorse&quot; again clearly signifies that the 
          leader is guilty of wrong-doing. Therefore, moral judgment is happening 
          here, but it is one-sided. The leader is guilty and must affirm this, 
          then the client will forgive more easily and they can both return to 
          a harmonious relationship.<br />
          <br />
          This section appears to argue that we can effect reconciliation only 
          if we first dispense with truth. I think the argument that the issue 
          of truth should be suspended in this way is alien to the Bible. This 
          appears to be manipulation of the client by taking a position we know 
          is dishonest for the sake of the effect it will have on the client. 
          I would like to see biblical authority for this stand. I, for my part 
          am ready to provide biblical evidence that love and truth are to be 
          expressed together.<br />
          <br />
          I think there is a big difference between expressing empathy for someone 
          who feels hurt, and expressing remorse, which clearly implies admitting 
          fault. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>I realize that the counselor's paper was informal, and that he may have 
        exaggerated or used figures of speech at points. Also, he may not have 
        had time to think everything through thoroughly. But there are so many 
        problems here requiring attention that we really must hear answers. I 
        hope these can be provided as quickly as possible.<br />

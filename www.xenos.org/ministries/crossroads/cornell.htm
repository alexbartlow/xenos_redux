              Certain perennial issues have always required explanation, such 
              as the deity and resurrection of Christ, the problem of evil, the

              of culture change, new issues present themselves as challenges to 
              the Christian message. For example, one of the significant apologetic 
              issues in the Enlightenment era was the possibility of miracles, 
              given the general assumption of a machine-like universe. The apologetic

              <p><font face="Times New Roman">Before we discuss the contemporary 
                challenge of the apologetic task, we should reflect on Paul's 
                thoughts regarding the importance of ideas.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">In 2 Corinthians 10:3-5, Paul states,</font></p>
              <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;For though we walk in 
                the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh, for the weapons 
                of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely powerful for 
                the destruction of fortresses. We are destroying speculations 
                and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, 
                and we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ....&quot;</font></em></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">This passage, perhaps more than 
                any other, identifies the critical importance of ideas. And because 
                apologetics focuses on the power of ideas, this passage is particularly 
                relevant.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">First, Paul asserts that Christians 
                are involved in a war (&quot;the weapons of our warfare&quot;). 
                The Bible describes a universe torn by the ravages of spiritual 
                warfare (Ephesians 6:12). Like occupied France in the 1940's, 
                there is no safe, neutral ground. We end up either giving tacit 
                support to the enemy, or we join the resistance. This is what 
                Jesus meant when he said, &quot;he who is not for me is against 
                me.&quot; </font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">Second, spiritual war is subtle. 
                It is fought on the battlefield of <i>ideas</i>. Paul points to 
                &quot;speculations,&quot; to &quot;lofty things raised up against 
                the knowledge of God,&quot; and states that we are &quot;taking 
                thoughts captive.&quot; Thoughts and ideas serve as would be fortresses. 
                Ideas form a wall around the heart. To gain access to the heart, 
                apologists must war with the ideas that shield it. To take a thought 
                captive means to defeat it, to expose its falseness. The apologist's 
                task is to blow holes in the fortress, so that the heart can be 
                exposed to light of truth.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">The language of combat is not the 
                only description we have of the church in the world. We are also 
                called &quot;ambassadors for Christ,&quot; &quot;the aroma of 
                Christ,&quot; &quot;salt and light.&quot; Yet, there is something 
                to the call to warfare in the realm of ideas that is uniquely 
                challenging. Ideas matter. They guide us as individuals, and they 
                move us collectively as a people. So much is at stake with the 
                ideas we accept or reject. To know the truth is to be set free

              we don&#146;t want to be cast as &quot;intolerant&quot; or &quot;unenlightened.&quot; 
              When we do confront divergent ideas, it is usually not in the form 
              of the idea itself, but its practical outworking. Many Christians, 
              for example, are disturbed by the push for &quot;political correctness.&quot; 
              But most of us neither understand the ideas behind it, nor what 
              they mean in relation to biblical truth. The Christian community 
              needs to develop a more profound sensitivity to the power of ideas

              <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ideas are subtle and as often as 
                not, we absorb them in the form of <i>attitudes</i>. We breath

                are so bombarded with ideas cast as images and 30 second sound 
                bites on the television that we scarcely have time to digest them 
                and interact with them. But they have their effect. We may think 
                of ideas as lifeless abstractions, as pieces of art that we can 
                either appreciate or ignore. But in fact, they are as real and 
                have more effect than the keyboard on which I wrote this talk.

              <p><font face="Times New Roman">In our &quot;information age,&quot; 
                we are barraged with claims and ideas of every sort. And current 
                research indicates that we naturally accept what we are presented 
                with as true. In a survey of the literature on belief formation, 
                Bruce Bower concludes, &quot;We assume beliefs are under conscious 
                control at all times. But beliefs can be created merely by passively

                This is especially true when ideas are communicated piecemeal

              is active. Christians are not behind protective walls, we are breaking 
              them down! These ideological fortresses characterize what Paul called 
              in Ephesians 2:2,3, &quot;the course of the world.&quot; Satan holds 
              non-Christians prisoner behind a wall of lies and deception. The 
              &quot;prince of the power of the air&quot; energizes cultural ideas, 
              forming walls that insulate people from the gospel. As Christians, 
              we should not see ourselves as hiding out behind fortresses, but 
              on the outside, aggressively placing the fortresses under siege. 
              Sometimes the Christian community has the illustration backward, 
              and thinks more of its own protection than engaging the spiritual 
              enemy in offensive warfare. </font> 
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">We can liken the image of an ideological 
                fortress to what the Germans have called a &quot;zeitgeist,&quot; 
                or &quot;spirit of the age.&quot; This refers to the body of prevailing 
                attitudes, ideas and values that drive a culture at a given point 
                in time. The spirit of the age manifests itself in cultural forms 
                such as family, law, the arts, religion and literature as well 
                as education, technology and economics. From these sources, we 
                develop an awareness of personal identity, a sense of personal 
                meaning, the values we serve, an understanding of the meaning 
                of human history, what is real and how reality can be known. From 
                the internalized thought-forms of a culture, its <i>zeitgeist</i>, 
                a grid of understanding is formed within us. Ideas are processed 
                through this grid, and either accepted or rejected based upon 
                their adherence to received thought forms. Some ideas simply don't 
                make sense to people of a given culture, not because they are 
                incoherent, but because the people simply can not relate what 
                they have accepted as true to the idea with which they are presented. 
                That is, they don&#146;t fit into the existing<i> plausibility 
                structure</i>. For many, Christianity is simply implausible.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">A central part of the work of apologetics, 
                then, is to identify the zeitgeist of a given culture and, where 
                it sets itself in opposition to biblical truth, engage in ideological 
                warfare. The aim is to challenge people's confidence in their 
                grid of understanding. To the extent that we are successful, we 
                help create a new grid that includes a category for biblical truth. 
                To complete the analogy, we blow a hole in the ideological fortress 
                so that the gospel can shine in and expose spiritual darkness.

              <p><font face="Times New Roman">Gaining a hearing for the gospel 
                in a non-Christian culture involves having a thorough understanding 
                of the spirit of the age. But it is at just this point that the 
                work so often breaks down. On the one hand, Christians have the 
                tendency to be blind to the ideological forces at work in a culture. 
                This results in the assimilation of inherently anti biblical ideas 
                into the church. We can see in our own day, for example, the cultural 
                preoccupation with the self manifested in an individualistic, 
                self-help view of spirituality. In an earlier day, theologians 
                were willing to reinterpret biblical teaching in terms of atheistic 
                naturalism, resulting in the &quot;death of God theology&quot; 
                so prevalent in the 1960's and 70's. There is also danger on the 
                other side, where the church has failed to engage the unbiblical 
                ideas and attitudes of its culture. The consequence is that the 
                church becomes an irrelevant force in culture, living in the illusion 
                of the &quot;glorious Christian past.&quot; <u>Christianity Today</u> 
                recently ran an interesting editorial observing that in the field 
                of Christian fiction, stories are set either in past centuries, 
                or at the end of human history. The author raised the question

              <p><font face="Times New Roman">The task of apologetics is ongoing 
                because cultural ideas, concerns, and attitudes change rapidly. 
                Consequently, there will never be a &quot;definitive&quot; work 
                on apologetics. Indeed, when we think such a work exists we are 
                in trouble. Apologetics is an ongoing work, needing constant revision 
                as new ideological elements enter into social discourse. If the 
                aim of apologetics is to break down fortresses, the key concern 
                is to know of what material the fortress is made. It does little 
                good to engage the enemy with stones and arrows, if the wall is 
                made of reinforced steel. To relate the gospel in a relevant way 
                to our culture, we need to expose ourselves to the same cultural 
                forms as the rest of society. We need to understand them, appreciate 
                them, and discerningly interact with them.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ideological fortress walling 
                out the light of truth today is a very complicated one by comparison 
                to previous generations. The late twentieth century faces numerous 
                complex and perplexing issues distinguishing it from earlier periods 
                of human history. The technological revolution of the past fifty 
                years presents us with a dizzying array of things that only the 
                wildest imaginations of earlier centuries could conceive: space 
                travel, global communication, atomic energy, genetic engineering, 
                to mention just a few. We who live at the end of this millennium 
                tend to view ourselves as occupying a different universe than 
                our not too distant ancestors. And in many ways this sense of 
                uniqueness is justified. The dilemmas we face could not be conceived 
                in earlier centuries. Possibilities such as the extinction of 
                the human race by our own hand, creation of a truly global culture, 
                a population curve so radical that it challenges the limits of 
                the earth's resources are but a few of the concerns we face today. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">Alvin Toffler is an early chronicler 
                of a generation faced with such realities. His books <u>Future 
                Shock</u> and <u>Ecospasm</u> offer helpful insight into the psyche 
                of modern Western man. In general, the intellectuals of the late 
                twentieth century, beginning with Toffler, perpetuate the notion 
                of radical difference, even disconnection of this generation from 
                earlier periods of Western history. Scholars commonly write about 
                the end of the Western tradition, and the emergence of the &quot;postmodern 
                world.&quot; The idea is that the assumptions which have guided 
                Western history for over two thousand years are worn out, they 
                no longer apply, and it is time to build from a completely new 
                foundation. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">The contemporary zeitgeist is a 
                patchwork of both old and new. Many of the ideological forms influencing 
                Western civilization since the Enlightenment remain very much 
                in the forefront of today's thinking. Yet, intriguing restatements 
                of ancient ideas are enjoying a powerful resurgence in our day. 
                In the university environment, and among broadly educated people 
                today, we can identify two fairly divergent ideological strains. 
                To do apologetics effectively, we must understand them. The first 
                is referred to as <i>modernism</i>, and the second <i>postmodernism.</i> 
                We will describe the public and personal tension created by the 
                modernism/postmodernism schism. Then we will discuss how the confluence 
                of modernism and postmodernism suggest a particular approach to 
                the task of apologetics. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">We use the terms <i>modernism</i> 
                and <i>postmodernism</i> as broad conceptual categories to describe 
                a fundamental rift between scholars who operate out of the tradition 
                of enlightenment rationalism, and those who reject it. At the 
                heart of the matter between modernists and postmodernists is a 
                controversy over <i>truth</i>. Specifically, the nature of truth, 
                how truth is arrived at, and the limits of human knowledge. The 
                modernist camp is committed to a confidence in rational objectivity, 
                and a stable field of knowledge. But for the modernists, the sphere 
                of knowledge is limited to the empirical sciences. This limitation 
                is commonly referred to as <i>positivism</i>. Taken as a world 
                view, as it often is, positivism is referred to as <i>scientism</i>. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">Scientism is a philosophical outlook 
                that interprets the enterprise of science through a gird of materialistic 
                naturalism. That is, all that exists is matter operating in a 
                closed universe of cause and effect. With this assumption in view, 
                the <i>data</i> of science and its philosophical <i>interpretation</i> 
                have become virtually inseparable in the academic setting. For 
                example, common interpretations of artificial intelligence assume 
                that since humans are machines, then we can build a machine that 
                is essentially human.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand, postmodernism 
                rejects two key modernist assumptions: <i>truth is objective</i> 
                and <i>progress based on technology is inevitable</i>. According 
                to postmodernists, modernist views of truth, such as the correspondence 
                theory, fail to provide a basis for unbiased objectivity. Truth 
                claims are conceived as socially constructed paradigms that apply 
                only to the community that finds them meaningful or useful. Further, 
                postmodernists argue, truth is conceptualized and expressed in 
                terms of language, which is an inherently circular and ambiguous 
                system&#151;the meaning of words is defined in terms of other 
                words, forming a &quot;hermeneutical circle&quot;, condemning 
                reason to the &quot;prison house of language.&quot; Consequently, 
                <i>all</i> truth is in the realm of the subjective or <i>socially 
                constructed</i>. Technological application of science is often 
                regarded as dangerous, since it is the outgrowth of Eurocentric 
                knowledge and motivated by Eurocentric cultural interests. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">Any attempt to provide a coherent, 
                comprehensive world view is referred to pejoratively as a &quot;metanarrative.&quot; 
                A metanarrative is a religious tradition or philosophical system 
                that commits acts of cultural tyranny by promoting the fiction 
                that all knowledge reduces to an absolute, unified theory. But 
                understand that this is no mere academic squabble. It is our view 
                that the contemporary ideological scene both within the university 
                community and in the culture as a whole is characterized by this 
                fundamental clash of ideas. Our research shows that influential 
                public realms, such as law, politics, music, religion and education 
                are deeply enmeshed in the modern/postmodern ideological schism. 
                It has created a climate of intellectual schizophrenia in America 
                that affects all of us. In his <i>Beyond the Culture Wars</i>, 
                University of Chicago professor Gerald Graff provides an illustration 
                of the kind of confusion that has become so common in academia:</font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">An undergraduate tells of an art 
                history course in which the instructor observed one day, 'As we 
                now know, the idea that knowledge can be objective is a positivist 
                myth that has been exploded by postmodern thought.' It so happens 
                that the student is concurrently enrolled in a political science 
                course in which the instructor speaks confidently about the objectivity 
                of his discipline as if it had not been 'exploded' at all. What 
                do you do? the student is asked. 'What else can I do?' he says. 
                'I trash objectivity in art history, and I presuppose it in political 
                science.' </font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">The person Graff mentions in his 
                book represents of the kind of maneuvering required of students 
                who attempt to navigate the turbulent waters of academia. And 
                in this respect, the academic environment is a microcosm of society 
                as a whole. On the one side, we are taught to believe that there 
                is a new world of truth out there to be discovered, that our voyage 
                is a heroic quest. On the other hand, we get word that we are 
                hopelessly adrift in an ocean of ideas that lead no where, and 
                that heroism is not to be found in the quest for new lands, but 
                simply in the adventure of being out at sea.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a price to be paid both 
                personally and culturally for this modern/postmodern fissure, 
                and we will examine both briefly. As a culture, we express confidence 
                in the objectivity of the scientific enterprise. Scientism, consequently, 
                is appealing, because it is rationally oriented and meshes well 
                with the sense of awe we experience when contemplating the accomplishments 
                of science. But we also recognize that science by its very nature 
                lacks the capacity to provide a meaningful moral framework to 
                apply its knowledge. Science can tell us what we <i>can</i> do, 
                but it can not tell us what we <i>should</i> do. Many of the uses 
                of advanced technology in this century have illustrated this dilemma

              and Human Values</i>. In reflecting on his tour through Nagasaki 
              in November of 1945, he writes:</font>

                except that we changed the scale of our indifference to man; and 
                conscience, in revenge, for an instant became immediate to us. 
                Before this immediacy fades in a sequence of televised atomic 
                tests, let us acknowledge our subject for what it is: civilization 
                face to face with its own implications.&quot;</font></em></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">The development of scientific knowledge 
                without the possibility of objective human values to guide it 
                has never been more frightening. And this may explain why there 
                is a growing uneasiness with science in our culture today. The 
                uneasiness comes not from what we see in science, but what we 
                fear of ourselves. Technological advancement forces us to see 
                ourselves for who we are like nothing else can. As Bronowski reminds 
                us, civilization stands &quot;face to face with its own implications.&quot; 
                In an era of history when we need as perhaps never before to be 
                guided by the light of objective moral knowledge, we confront 
                the titanic postmodern &quot;no!&quot; The twenty first century 
                will be confronted with extraordinary problems and science will 
                be mobilized to respond to them. But how will the solutions offered 
                by science be implemented and directed? With a generation steeped 
                in postmodern relativism, we have every reason to be deeply concerned.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">The application of science is not 
                the only place where the tension between modern and postmodern 
                thought imposes itself on public life. The Constitution is the 
                foundation of our public life. It is rooted, in substantial part, 
                in the modernist belief in the objectivity of inalienable human 
                rights. These rights, it is held, are identified by reason and 
                protected by a body of law. But the postmodern rejection of objectivity 
                brings into question the stability of the Constitution as a basis 
                for social justice and individual rights. Postmodernists claim 
                that the Constitution, like all social contracts, reflect the 
                arbitrary whim of the powerful over the economically marginalized. 
                They deny the possibility of objectively identifying a body of 
                &quot;inalienable rights.&quot; The scholarly and professional 
                community has become deeply divided over the application of postmodern 
                analysis to law and politics. And the stakes for society could 
                not be higher. Sanford Levinson, professor of law at the University 
                of Texas, Austin states, &quot;The death of constitutionalism 
                may be the central event of our time, just as the death of God 
                was that of the past century.&quot; </font></p>

              of rights defined as empowerment and cultural relativism present 
              a devastating picture of social life. Charles Sykes observes:</font> 
              <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;At times it seems that 
                we can no longer talk to one another. Or rather, we can talk--and 
                shout, demand, and vilify--but we cannot reason. We lack agreed-upon 
                standards to which we can refer our disputes. In the absence of 
                shared notions of justice or equity, many of the issues we confront 
                appear increasingly to be unresolvable.&quot;</font></em></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">So the nature of public debate has 
                changed in light of the denial of standards for justice and reason. 
                As the demand for special sensitivity and group empowerment increasingly 
                replace reason, we feel more threatened by others than drawn toward 
                our common humanity. Where personal significance is tied to sub 
                culturally defined identity, the possibility of meaningful exchange 
                between subcultures becomes correspondingly allusive. Sykes continues,</font></p>
              <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Increasingly, debates 
                take place between antagonists who deny their opponents' ability 
                to understand their plight. Inevitably, that turns such clashes 
                into increasingly bitter ad hominem attacks in which victim status 
                and the insistent demands for sensitivity are played as trump 
                cards....Of course, sensitivity to the needs and concerns of others 
                is the mark of a civil and civilized society. But the victimist 
                demand for sensitivity is more problematic. To be sensitive is 
                not to argue or reason but to feel, to attune one's response to 
                another's sense of aggrievement...One can be insensitive without 
                intending to be; only the victims can judge.&quot;</font></em></p>

                bantering. Since the facts could not locate guilt, it came down 
                to which side could portray itself as the most oppressed victim. 
                Both sides were well prepared by public relations experts. Hill 
                became a paradigm of oppressed womanhood, and Thomas championed 
                the cause of the black male under, in his words, &quot;a high

              <p><font face="Times New Roman">But let's return to Graff's student. 
                Here, we find the personal dimensions of the modern/postmodern 
                split. We can identify three general characteristics of today's 
                student. First, they are largely<i> uncritical</i>. It is increasingly 
                difficult for students to form reasoned and defensible views in 
                the realm of ideas. In the give and take of rigorous intellectual 
                interaction around divergent ideas students sharpen their analytic 
                skills, find their views challenged by the light of evidence and 
                argument, and develop the ability to think critically and constructively. 
                However, many observe, the ideological climate within the university 
                is often inimical to the development of these skills. When students 
                are taught that values are arbitrary &quot;social constructions,&quot; 
                and that there is no objective basis for them, they draw the obvious 
                conclusion that it doesn't matter what view they hold. So the 
                only analytical framework most students know are the vacuous principles 
                of &quot;openness&quot; and &quot;tolerance.&quot; Students get 
                the message: since there is no truth to be discovered, one view 
                is as good as any other. Consequently, students fail to find a 
                place for reason in the formulation or defense of their ideas. 
                This fosters an anti intellectual environment on campus where 
                ideas are labeled &quot;acceptable&quot; or &quot;unacceptable,&quot; 
                then monitored and managed, rather than rationally engaged.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">It has been my experience teaching 
                philosophy, that when students are first confronted with the contradictory 
                nature of their views, they are largely unmoved. One of two responses 
                can generally be predicted. First, students will dislodge belief 
                from reason, by reducing every judgment to opinion. Reason, after 
                all, is for things like science, not values or truth. Secondly, 
                students justify their positions by asserting their right to believe 
                whatever views they want. Discussing abortion in ethics classes 
                often brings this dynamic out. I found the majority of students 
                attracted to the pro life position. They commonly conceded that 
                the fetus is a person, given their intuition that neonates and 
                others are persons. Further, they agreed that killing innocent 
                persons is wrong. But when it came to the inference, &quot;abortion 
                is wrong,&quot; the majority of students who agreed with the premises 
                fled from the obvious conclusion. Consistently, the response to 
                this dilemma was &quot;well, we should be free to do what we want,&quot; 
                or &quot;it's still my decision.&quot; For many, no amount of 
                reasoning could dislodge these sophomoric pronouncement.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">The majority of students exchange 
                reason for feelings in the formation of spiritual, moral and political 
                beliefs. As we observed in the above example, basic beliefs are 
                justified in the realm of radically privatized, idiosyncratic 
                preference. Individuals and the content of their belief are hard 
                to separate when truth is rooted subjectively, rather than discovered 
                in a world independent of them. Consequently, challenging a person's 
                belief is tantamount to calling into question their right to choose, 
                or their value as a person. Certain beliefs are sacrosanct. It 
                is virtually immoral to engage in critical dialogue where a student's 
                beliefs are politically correct. Since these beliefs are often 
                anti biblical, the work of evangelism on campus is especially 
                difficult.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">Second, today's students are generally 
                <i>cynical</i>. Some students find their way to identity groups 
                that promote particular ideologies, but many avoid ideological 
                commitment. Holding fast to beliefs, they have learned, is dangerous. 
                True believers, the dogmatists, are often characterized as history's 
                villain. The argument is that when we think we possess <i>the</i> 
                truth, it leads to conflict; and conflict leads to war, prejudice 
                and injustice. So, better not to take anything too seriously. 
                Most students are in a state of indifference toward the world 
                of ideas. Values are at best subjective and at worst malignant. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">All too often, this kind of cynicism 
                is cultivated in the class room. Instructors can and do unwittingly 
                contribute to the students cynicism. This occurs when professors 
                teach the pursuit of knowledge as either a value-neutral pragmatic 
                exercise (&quot;isn&#146;t it fascinating what we can do&quot;), 
                or an interesting, if irrelevant, mental exercise (&quot;isn't 
                it amazing what these people thought&quot;). Independent of meaningful 
                and defensible values, knowledge reduces to technology or curious 
                cultural artifact. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">Third, students today are <i>alienated</i>. 
                We refer not in the romantic notion of the alienated man of the 
                '60's, but to a palpable sense isolation. More than ever, students 
                come from divorced families. Often cynical of intimate personal 
                relationships to begin with, students from this background find 
                ever more reason to remain isolated through what they learn in 
                college. Meaningful and lasting relationships require trust. But 
                trust requires a shared foundation on which to base relationships. 
                And it is at just this point that the relativism of the university 
                has personal implications for many students. Bellah describes 
                the problem well:</font></p>
              <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now if selves are defined 
                by their preferences, but those preferences are arbitrary, then 
                each self constitutes its own moral universe, and there is finally 
                no way to reconcile conflicting claims about what is good in itself. 
                All we can do is refer to chains of consequences and ask if our 
                actions prove useful or consistent in light of our own value systems. 
                All we can appeal to in relationships with others is their self 
                interest, likewise enlightened, or their intuitive sympathies. 
                Where sympathy or already congruent values are not enough to resolve 
                moral disagreements between ourselves and others, we have no recourse 
                except to withdraw from them.&quot;</font></em></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">Other forms of alienation also affect 
                college students. Racial minorities, first generation college 
                students and women often feel isolated from the dominant culture 
                of the university community. Isolation often drives minorities 
                and women to life style enclaves, or at least under the ideological 
                influence of these enclaves. Here, alienation from culture is 
                furthered by isolationist ideology. In Women's Studies and Afrocentric 
                Studies curricula, the Christian world view is under considerable 
                assault. It is often characterized as &quot;paternalistic,&quot; 
                or &quot;Eurocentric.&quot; Christianity is seen as the basis 
                of racism, sexism and ecological tyranny. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">Much of the thinking that shapes 
                the ideological fortress around students come from the postmodern 
                camp, as these descriptions suggest. But modernism also has it 
                a role. The science-as-knowledge/reality-as-nature hypothesis 
                is appealing to students because it provides an explanation for 
                their observations about the world. The sciences provide a solid, 
                objective base to pursue knowledge. There is, of course, a downside 
                to scientism and students are quick to pick it up. While scientism 
                provides a neat explanation for the operations of nature, it fails 
                to do much for the human self-concept. In fact, scientism is very 
                much about the business of erasing the notion of the<i> individual 
                </i>all together. Sociobiology, artificial intelligence, animal 
                language and other research areas often assert that individuals 
                are nothing other than the sum total of the impersonal processes 
                that constitute their being. Your former colleague Carl Sagan 
                put it succinctly when he defined man as &quot;an astonishingly 
                compact, self-ambulatory computer.&quot; It is worth noting that 
                scientism and postmodernism agree on this view of the self. Ironically 
                while popular culture today is obsessed with the self, much of 
                academia is, at least from the stand point of theory, committed 
                to its irradication. If current trends persist, the death of 
                the self in the twenty-first century will follow on the heels 
                of the death of God in the nineteenth and the death of objective 
                values in the twentieth. With the kind of pressures the next century 
                will experience, this is indeed a frightening prospect.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">So where does this leave the contemporary 
                university student? They are given reasons from every quarter 
                to disregard the Christian message. And indeed, we find that while 
                the debate used to center around the naturalism/theism dichotomy, 
                in recent years Christianity has been pushed out to the periphery. 
                In many ways, the secularized culture of Europe is looking more 
                and more familiar on the American campus today. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our assessment of the student population 
                should not be excessively negative. There are both substantial 
                fortresses raised up against the knowledge of God, and reason 
                to be hopeful about reaching people for Christ in the university

              same needs and questions as all the generations that came before 
              them. We can deny God's existence, but we still have to live in 
              his world. And we can deny our uniqueness as humans but we can never 
              escape his image within us. Christianity alone provides a basis 
              for truth and satisfies the vacuum of emptiness in our postmodern 
              culture.</font> 
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">When challenged by the importance 
                of ideas and the need to rationally justify one's beliefs, many 
                students respond. It takes time to work through their pre-programmed 
                relativism and subjectivism, but it certainly happens. The capacity 
                to diffuse postmodern rhetorical devices is often helpful. For 
                example, when notions of truth and value come up in my classes 
                and I encounter postmodern rhetoric, I ask questions like these: 
                &#145;What do you think of the person who can never be wrong about 
                what they believe?&#146; Obviously arrogant, close-minded, right?. 
                Or, &#145;What about the person whose views are meant to manipulate 
                others for their own purposes?&#146; Clearly a dangerous person. 
                But in reality we are describing the postmodern view. If truth 
                is subjective and constructed, that&#146;s what it comes down 
                to. Genuine humility and tolerance can only be found in an objective 
                view of truth. So there is, after all, a basis for discussion.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">Second, students are, and perhaps 
                always have been, anti authority in temperament. The student years 
                are times of self-discovery and self-definition. Part of that 
                process is casting off, at least for a while, the constraints 
                of parental influence and social norms. This is one of the major 
                reasons why the relativistic dogma of postmodernism is so appealing<i>. 
                But one authority not cast off by students is their instructors</i>. 
                Faculty have an enormous influence on students. Christian faculty 
                need to be aware that for the vast majority of students, their 
                classroom may be the closest thing to a church their students 
                will enter. Since the ideologies discussed </font>

              <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Darwin knew that accepting

                conviction that matter is the stuff of all existence and that 
                all mental and spiritual phenomenon are its by-products&#133;.Yet, 
                as pointed out by contemporary evolutionary scholar Douglas Futuyma, 
                seldom do the detractors of the Darwinian world view take note 
                of its positive implications. In Darwin&#146;s world we are not 
                helpless prisoners of a static world order but, rather, masters 
                of our own fate&#133;.And from a strictly scientific point of 
                view rejecting biological evolution is no different from rejecting 
                other natural phenomenon such as electricity and gravity.&quot;<sup>

              consensus is so well formed in much of the campus today. But it 
              is even more disturbing that there has been little competent Christian 
              response to it. There are a variety of reasons for this fact. One 
              is that Christian faculty are so rare in the humanities and social 
              sciences where postmodernism thrives. Another is that most academics 
              today are specialists, whose work is relatively unaffected by the 
              ideological climate on campus. In the pressure to attain tenure 
              and to secure grants for research, professors often feel isolated 
              from the ideological challenges around them. But as ambassadors 
              for Christ, Christian scholars need to make themselves conversant 
              in critical ideology, identifying it in scholarly work and among 
              their colleagues. It is often true that academics absorb prevailing 
              ideas just as their students. Paul Vitz's comments in this regard 
              are insightful:</font> 
              <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;It is difficult to document 
                such a thing as the general attitude of a profession. But the 
                hostility of most psychologists to Christianity is very real. 
                For years I was part of that sentiment; today it still surrounds 
                me. It is a curious hostility, for most psychologists are not 
                aware of it. Their lack of awareness is due mostly to sheer ignorance 
                of what Christianity is--for that matter, of what any religion 
                is. The universities are so secularized that most academics can 
                no longer articulate why they are opposed to Christianity. They 
                merely assume that for all rational people the question of being 
                a Christian was settled--negatively--at some time in the past.&quot;</font></em></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">Christian professors can have a 
                significant affect on both students and peers by providing critical 
                insight into these ideologies and their confidence in biblical 
                Christianity. Sponsoring discussion groups based on postmodern 
                works relating to your particular field holds much promise. The 
                idea is merely to get the conversation going and creating opportunity 
                for colleagues and students to grapple with the issues of the 
                day.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman">The influence of scientism and postmodernism 
                far exceed their intellectual merits. While scientism is often 
                countered by Christian scholars, most fail to take postmodernism 
                seriously. But this results in our willingness to give ground 
                to the enemy. On the other hand, Christians on campus appear intimidated 
                by postmodern ideology. This is particularly true of undergraduates, 
                but it is also evident in graduate students. There can be no question 
                that the Christian community needs to have a response to the issues 
                that are regularly confronted in the curriculum, the class room 
                and in the social fabric of the university.</font>

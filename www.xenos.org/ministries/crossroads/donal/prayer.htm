      <p align="center"><font size="3">{This article was published in the <i>Journal 
        of Christian Nursing</i> 16.3 (Summer 1999): 17-21, <br>
        a publication of the<a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/iv/ncf"> Nurses 
        Christian Fellowship</a>.} </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jennifer, a nurse researcher 
        at a state university, called me one day. &quot;Guess what I've been asked 
        to do?&quot; Jennifer asked excitedly. &quot;Some physicians at our medical 
        center are really interested in that research on prayer and healing. They 
        want me to put together a protocol examining the effectiveness of prayer 
        on recovery from open-heart surgery. What do you think?&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Congratulations. That's 
        really exciting,&quot; I said. &quot;What do they want you to do?&quot; 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They know I'm involved 
        in my church and asked me to recruit people for some prayer teams. I'm 
        also to develop the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the prayer subjects, 
        the type of prayer we'll do and the outcomes we'll measure.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Will you have a control 
        group?&quot; I asked. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, yes! They want 
        a double-blind, randomized study. This will be top-quality research.&quot; 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So,&quot; I replied. 
        &quot;You're going to do your best to limit the prayer some people get 
        so that you can measure the benefits for those who receive a lot of prayer? 
        Do you think that's how God intended prayer to be used?&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long discussion about 
        the appropriateness of research on prayer ensued. This type of research 
        is receiving more attention as the role of faith and spirituality in health 
        and healing is being seriously examined. This interest is a welcome change 
        from the way prayer was frequently minimized or dismissed. Larry Dossey, 
        the secular expert on prayer for healing, writes about a man visiting 
        a physician for chronic abdominal pain.<sup><a name="Ref1"></a><a href="#Note1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        Finding no medical problems, the doctor suggested some changes in the 
        man's diet and attention to his stress. In parting, the physician said, 
        &quot;Good luck. I'll be praying for you.&quot; Overcome with fear, the 
        man demanded to know what was really wrong with him. He, like many, assumed 
        that prayer is needed only when all other healing resources are exhausted. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinical findings bear this 
        out. Many nurses fail to recognize or respond to patients' spiritual needs.<sup><a name="Ref2"></a><a href="#Note2">[2]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        Among one group of Christian nurses, seventeen percent initiated prayer 
        with patients weekly, twenty-six percent monthly, thirty-two percent every 
        six months and eighteen percent never initiated it.<sup><a name="Ref3"></a><a href="#Note3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        Fewer than one percent of physicians pray with their patients.<sup><a name="Ref4"></a><a href="#Note4">[4]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        More than two-thirds of patients reported never discussing religious issues 
        with their doctors, yet sixty-four percent want doctors to pray with them.<sup><a name="Ref5"></a><a href="#Note5">[5]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        Eighty-two percent of Americans believe in the power of prayer.<sup><a name="Ref6"></a><a href="#Note6">[6]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        Picking up on this interest, some of Dossey's books have hit the bestseller 
        list.<sup><a name="Ref7"></a><a href="#Note7">[7]</a></sup>&nbsp; Additionally, 
        numerous research projects involving prayer have been launched recently.<sup><a name="Ref8"></a><a href="#Note8">[8]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research on prayer is not 
        new. In 1872 John Tyndall, a professor in London, proposed having all 
        Christians pray for patients in a particular hospital for a number of 
        years.<sup><a name="Ref9"></a><a href="#Note9">[9]</a></sup>&nbsp; The 
        mortality rates for patients with a particular disease at that hospital 
        would be compared with those at other hospitals. Tyndall anticipated no 
        differences, which would support his skepticism of prayer's efficacy. 
        The proposal created much controversy, raising methodological, theological 
        and ethical concerns that still apply today. One response was published 
        by Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin. His retrospective analysis 
        found that clergy and royalty, for whom a long life is frequently prayed 
        for, had shorter life expectancies than those of other professionals.<sup><a name="Ref10"></a><a href="#Note10">[10]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        Thus, the scientific controversy began. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1"><b>Defining Prayer </b></font></p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b><font size="3">We 
        as Christians can welcome the current interest in prayer, but we must 
        also be somewhat cautious. The term <i>prayer</i> means different things 
        to different people. One researcher calls prayer &quot;distance healing&quot; 
        and defines it &quot;as any purely mental effort undertaken by one person 
        with the intention of improving physical or emotional well-being in another.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref11"></a><a href="#Note11">[11]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        For others, prayer is sending impersonal healing energy. These broad definitions 
        lead some to equate prayer with sorcery, shamanism, psychic healing and 
        telepathy.<sup><a name="Ref12"></a><a href="#Note12">[12]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dossey sees prayer as a 
        type of language, expressed either consciously or unconsciously. He prefers 
        the term <i>prayerfulness</i> to express a general attitude of leaving 
        things in the hands of some universal consciousness.<sup><a name="Ref13"></a><a href="#Note13">[13]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        He acknowledges that his view of prayer is &quot;far different&quot; from 
        the &quot;old biblically-based views of prayer,&quot; where requests were 
        offered to a God distinct from humans.<sup><a name="Ref14"></a><a href="#Note14">[14]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        According to Dossey, biblical prayer arises from a worldview that &quot;is 
        now antiquated and incomplete&quot; and constitutes a &quot;uniquely 'pathological 
        mythology.'&quot;<sup><a name="Ref15"></a><a href="#Note15">[15]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christian prayer can only 
        be seen as a humble request to the all-knowing, all-powerful God to bring 
        about what he knows is best in a particular situation (Mt 6:25-34). Prayer 
        is not just a state of mind, although it certainly should impact one's 
        state of mind (Phil 4:6; 1 Thess 5:17-18). Prayer is not just an energy 
        which, once emitted, takes on a life of its own with predictable outcomes. 
        While we should ask for specific outcomes, we must always acknowledge 
        that our requests will come about only &quot;if the Lord wills&quot; (Jas 
        4:13-16; 1 Jn 5:14). </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1"><b>The Available Research </b></font></p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b><font size="3">In 
        evaluating research on prayer for healing, we must examine the type of 
        practice being tested. Interestingly, the most significant study was carried 
        out by a Christian cardiologist using only <i>born again</i> Christians 
        practicing daily devotional prayer and actively involved in Christian 
        fellowship.<sup><a name="Ref16"></a><a href="#Note16">[16]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        Dr. Randolph Byrd randomly assigned 393 coronary care unit (CCU) patients 
        to either an intercessory prayer group or a control group. Between three 
        and seven intercessors prayed daily for each patient in the prayed-for 
        group. Intercessors prayed for three specific outcomes for all patients 
        and added other requests perceived beneficial to particular patients. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Byrd's positive results 
        are widely cited. The prayed-for group had six significantly better outcomes:reduced 
        incidences of congestiveheart failure (p&lt;0.03),cardiopulmonary arrest 
        (p&lt;0.02), pneumonia(p&lt;0.03) and intubation (p&lt;0.002); and reduced 
        useof diuretics (p&lt;0.05) andantibiotics (p&lt;0.005). The prayed-for 
        group had a significantly better outcome overall(p&lt;0.01). However, 
        twenty-three other outcomes were measured. Fourteen of these favored the 
        prayed-for group, but the differences were not statistically significant. 
        The other nine measures showed no differences, or slightly favored the 
        control group. For example, there were nonsignificant differences between 
        the number of days patients spent in the CCU, the number of days spent 
        in the hospital and the number of deaths. This is particularly unfortunate 
        since two of the three specific outcomes prayed about for all patients 
        were a rapid recovery and the prevention of death. The third was for the 
        prevention of complications. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the positive results 
        are certainly welcome, this study reveals the problems of basing conclusions 
        about the effectiveness of prayer on scientific research. Byrd noted that 
        the scientific studies conducted prior to his had inconclusive results. 
        Since then, another double-blind study with fifty-three patients showed 
        significant differences on nine of twenty-four outcomes measured(p&lt;0.05).<sup><a name="Ref17"></a><a href="#Note17">[17]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        A study with forty AIDS patients found significant improvements in six 
        of eleven outcomes measured.<sup><a name="Ref18"></a><a href="#Note18">[18]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        Two other recent studies found no significant differences between the 
        prayed-for group and the control (although Bruce Greyson studied LeShan 
        healing, which differs somewhat from traditional prayer).<sup><a name="Ref19"></a><a href="#Note19">[19]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        A systematic review found no clear pattern of effectiveness based on few 
        completed studies.<sup><a name="Ref20"></a><a href="#Note20">[20]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        While frustrating from a scientific perspective, these results are precisely 
        what would be expected, given the biblical teaching on prayer for healing. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1"><b>Biblical Teaching </b></font></p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3">&nbsp;</font></b><font size="3">The 
        passage most directly applicable is James 5:13-16. James advocates that 
        those who are sick should call the elders who should pray over them and 
        anoint them with oil. While oil had medicinal uses at the time, it also 
        had important symbolic value and was used by Jesus' disciples (Mk 6:13). 
        &quot;Consequently, oil was a powerful reminder to the church that God 
        was able to heal and that his healing powers were already being made manifest.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref21"></a><a href="#Note21">[21]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        When sick, Christians should call upon the healing power of God through 
        their own and others' prayers. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James 5:15 (NASB) states, 
        &quot;The prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick.&quot; 
        The context is a discussion of sin, with James concluding: &quot;Therefore, 
        confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, so that you 
        may be healed&quot; (v. 16). The Old Testament records numerous instances 
        of God sending sickness as punishment for sin (e.g. Lev 26:16; Num 12:9-10; 
        2 Kings 5:27; 2 Chron 21:14-15; Ps 38). A similar connection is recorded 
        in the New Testament (Lk 1:20; Jn 5:14; Acts 5:1-5; 1 Cor 11:30). As unpopular 
        as it may be to believe, God sometimes sends illness because of people's 
        sin. This leads many scholars to conclude that James promises healing 
        only when sickness is the result of sin.<sup><a name="Ref22"></a><a href="#Note22">[22]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        John similarly promises that prayer will bring &quot;life&quot; (one aspect 
        of healing)<sup><a name="Ref23"></a><a href="#Note23">[23]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        to those who have committed certain sins (1 Jn 5:14-16). </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Jesus emphatically 
        denies that all sickness is the result of sin (Lk 13:1-5; Jn 9:1-3). The 
        Bible describes illness as having natural, divine or demonic origins. 
        The complexity portrayed accurately mirrors people's experience. While 
        God is the divine healer (Ex 15:26), and Jesus is the Great Physician, 
        healing is not always God's will for individuals. Paul prayed three times 
        for the removal of his thorn in the flesh (2 Cor 12:7-10). God did not 
        respond with physical healing but rather empowered Paul to be content 
        in the midst of his weakness, suffering and pain. Paul similarly calls 
        on all Christians to learn to be content with whatever they have (Phil 
        4:9-13). </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's will may be to allow 
        some illnesses to run their natural courses. We know that many influential 
        Christians in the early church got sick--people such as Paul (Gal 4:13-14), 
        Epaphroditus (Phil 2:25-30), Timothy (1 Tim 5:23) and Trophimus (2 Tim 
        4:20). We can reasonably assume people prayed for their healing, yet there 
        is no evidence their health improved miraculously. Neither is there any 
        mention that their illnesses were connected to sin, or that the lack of 
        divine healing reflected weak faith. The clear implication is that much 
        illness is of natural origin and exists simply because people live in 
        a fallen world (Gen 3:16-19; Rom 8:20-25). Most people must rely on natural 
        forms of healing or learn to cope with the disabilities resulting from 
        illness and aging (Eccles 11:8-10). </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1"><b>Theologically Informed Research </b></font></p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b><font size="3">Appropriate 
        recognition of the supernatural complicates any attempt to scientifically 
        study prayer and healing. Prayer will have a different impact on supernaturally 
        caused illnesses compared to illnesses of purely natural origin. How clinical 
        trials could control for this is difficult to imagine. Controls are designed 
        to remove all volitional and subjective aspects of a therapy. If that 
        were possible for prayer, it would remove God's involvement and thereby 
        could not be Christian prayer. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A direct cause-and-effect 
        correlation seems only possible if prayer is impersonal, like a drug or 
        form of energy. Dossey claims that prayer's power lies in one's thoughts 
        and intentions. This type of prayer is amenable to study because, once 
        emitted, it should cause its intended effects. Dossey's book on negative 
        prayer claims, &quot;We are continually bathed in the negative intentions 
        of other--various 'little curses,' comments and thoughts of an infinite 
        variety.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref24"></a><a href="#Note24">[24]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        But then, why do we not see these intentions wreaking havoc in our lives? 
        Dossey proposes that we are protected by a &quot;spiritual immune system,&quot; 
        just like our physical immune system.<sup><a name="Ref25"></a><a href="#Note25">[25]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        Dossey's unwillingness to accept that a personal God chooses how to answer 
        prayer forces him to invent something (devoid of supporting evidence) 
        to circumvent the implications of his view of prayer. The inconsistent 
        research results are further evidence that Dossey's view of prayer is 
        not correct. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christians must similarly 
        beware of <i>ad hoc </i>reasoning to protect flawed arguments from contradictory 
        evidence. We should always pray in response to illness, but we cannot 
        guarantee its outcome. Experience shows that many prayers for healing 
        are not answered by divine cures. Some claim this is because of people's 
        weak faith. But the faith that moves mountains is not <i>big faith</i> 
        but <i>little faith,</i> faith the size of the tiniest mustard seed (Mt 
        17:20). In fact, Jesus responded dramatically to those who admitted their 
        faith or belief was weak (Mk 9:22-24; Jn 20:26-29). The mistake is believing 
        that God promises to heal all illness. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faith plays an essential 
        role in prayer, although the research apparently assumes that everyone's 
        prayer is equally effective. James states that prayer offered <i>in faith</i> 
        will heal (5:15), implying that prayer without faith will not heal. The 
        Greek syntax shows that he is referring to the faith of those praying, 
        not the sick person.<sup><a name="Ref26"></a><a href="#Note26">[26]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        He also tells us that the prayer of the righteous is powerful and effective 
        (5:16). By implication, the prayers of the unrighteous are less effective. 
        Our motives also influence prayer's effectiveness (Jas 4:3). A prayer 
        study would have to control for all these factors. If someone had the 
        gift of healing (1 Cor 12:9), things would be further complicated. Other 
        factors make the design of prayer research complex, leading some to question 
        whether meaningful conclusions could ever be drawn. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1"><b>Guidelines When Praying for Healing </b></font></p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b><font size="3">Yet, 
        Christians must remain committed to prayer for healing. James provides 
        further guidance by mentioning Elijah's prayer for rain. A subsequent 
        incident contrasts Elijah's effective prayer with the ineffective prayer 
        of the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18). Elijah proposes a test to reveal 
        the true God to the people of Israel. Each side would build an altar to 
        sacrifice an ox and then pray to either God or Baal to consume the offering 
        with fire. The prophets of Baal build their altar and pray to Baal. From 
        morning until noon, they repeat like a mantra, &quot;O Baal, answer us.&quot; 
        They dance and leap around the sacrificial altar, working themselves into 
        a greater and greater frenzy. They eventually slash themselves with swords 
        until blood gushes from their wounds. At the end of the day, the pathetic 
        picture is summarized by the narrator: &quot;There was no response, no 
        one answered, no one paid attention&quot; (v. 29, NIV). </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Elijah takes over. 
        He soaks his altar with water and prays, &quot;O LORD, God of Abraham, 
        Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, 
        that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your 
        bidding. Answer me, O LORD, answer me, so that this people may know that 
        you, O LORD, are God, and that you have turned their hearts back&quot; 
        (vv. 36-37). Suddenly, the altar and everything on it bursts into flames. 
        The people know who the true God is. They fall down and worship him. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prophets of Baal thought 
        their prayers were more likely to be answered by increasing the volume 
        and repetitions. They believed their chances would improve by working 
        themselves into a particular emotional state. They focused on what <i>they</i> 
        had to do to get the answer <i>they</i> wanted out of their god. Theirs 
        was basically an impersonal, mechanistic approach to prayer, similar to 
        much of what is researched as prayer today. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While few of us would slash 
        ourselves with swords to impress God, how often do we pray in similar 
        ways? Do we think that by denying ourselves something, God will be more 
        inclined to answer our prayers? If we get up earlier or stay up later, 
        or pray longer or louder, do we think God will be more likely to hear 
        us? Do we believe that some meditative technique or yoga position will 
        get us into a state of consciousness which will make our prayers more 
        effective? All of these reflect the impersonal approach of the prophets 
        of Baal; and all were in vain. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, Elijah humbly 
        turned to God and acknowledged his rightful place as Lord of the universe. 
        He focused on what would glorify God. He approached God directly and personally, 
        not through rituals and repetition. While the Bible affirms persistence 
        in prayer (Lk 18:1-5; 2 Cor 12:8), meaningless repetition is rejected 
        (Is 29:13; Mt 6:7). The emphasis is on God's ability to bring something 
        about, not what we must do to convince him to answer. Answered prayer 
        depends on God's power, not ours (Eph 3:20). And prayer is answered according 
        to his will, not ours (Mt 7:11; Jn 14:13; 1 Jn 5:14-15). </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incident with Elijah 
        shows that there is nothing inherently wrong with testing prayer. Jesus' 
        healings played an important part in validating his role and his mission 
        (Jn 20:30-31). God promises to provide evidence for those willing to follow 
        him (Jn 7:17). However, prayer research is not always done to glorify 
        God. While he can and does heal in response to prayer, he does not seem 
        to do this with the prevalence some would have us believe. We must be 
        careful before claiming that God has worked a miracle, just as we must 
        carefully authenticate any alleged direct message from God (Deut 18:17-22; 
        1 Cor 14:27-29; 1 Jn 4:1-3). </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prayer research has the 
        potential to distort people's view of prayer. Consistent healing outcomes 
        would not be expected of biblical prayer. This should not discourage those 
        already committed to Jesus Christ, since our confidence in him is based 
        on faith, not on scientific research. But for those who have not yet come 
        to faith in Christ, negative research results could be very disillusioning. 
        Unless accompanied by a proper understanding of prayer, this could become 
        a barrier between these people and Christ. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, God does promise 
        certain outcomes from prayer. When we are ill or suffering, God promises 
        comfort and the means to cope (2 Cor 1:3-6). If prayer research measures 
        the outcomes of people's ability to deal with illness and tragedy, we 
        should expect significantly positive results. However, this introduces 
        a level of complexity to the research that will make definite conclusions 
        difficult. We should also see benefits in those who pray. One of the studies, 
        which found no differences between controls and those prayed for, did 
        find that those who prayed improved significantly in ten of eleven mental 
        health measures.<sup><a name="Ref27"></a><a href="#Note27">[27]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        Other research shows that those who pray in deep and personal ways are 
        more healthy and cope better with illness.<sup><a name="Ref28"></a><a href="#Note28">[28]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
        However, this takes us into another subject, too broad to cover here. 
        Meanwhile, we as Christians must affirm our commitment to pray, regardless 
        of what prayer research may reveal. </font></p>

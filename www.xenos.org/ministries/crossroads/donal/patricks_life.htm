      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>The name of Saint Patrick is today virtually synonymous with Ireland, 
        and yet the historical details of Patrick's life are shrouded in legend. 
        Studying for this paper has been a bitter-sweet experience for me. It 
        has been difficult to accept that the Patrick whom I knew growing up in 
        Ireland did not really exist. Due to the findings of recent scholars, 
        gone is the bishop with miter and crozier marching all over Ireland; gone 
        is the fire at Slane to challenge the High King of Ireland and his druids; 
        gone is the battle of miracles by which the druids were single-handedly 
        defeated; gone is Patrick reaching for the shamrock to explain the Trinity; 
        gone is Patrick's banishment of snakes.<sup><font size="1"><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote1anc" href="#sdfootnote1sym"><sup>1</sup></a></font></sup> 
      </p>
      <p>Sadness creeps over me while learning that the historical basis of these 
        cherished stories vanishes into murky myth. But as the fog of these legends 
        is burned away, what appears is a fascinating story of an amazing man&#151;a 
        real man with whom I can identify. Later biographies glorified Patrick, 
        but &quot;the holy superman described in the 'lives' of Patrick is nowhere 
        to be found in Patrick's own writings.&quot;<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote2anc" href="#sdfootnote2sym"><sup>2</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        The Patrick we meet in his own words is a man who deeply loves God and 
        other people, who has to deal with his own sins and weaknesses, who is 
        lonely and hurt, but who is also deeply thankful for all that God has 
        given him. </p>
      <p>The real Patrick is a humble man who can flame up in righteous anger 
        at the murder of some of his recent converts. He is a man who is extremely 
        successful in his missionary work, yet who attributes all the praise to 
        God. He is a man who has been wrongly accused by his superiors, and finds 
        that he needs to defend himself and his work. In short, we find a real 
        person with whom we today can relate. He goes through the ups and downs 
        of life like we do, and has to deal with both great successes and terrible 
        set-backs. Pervading everything is his experience of God's caring presence 
        and comfort. Although the Breastplate of Patrick was not written by him, 
        Patrick's other writings reveal that this wonderful hymn captures his 
        mindset accurately.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> Christ beside me, Christ before me, Christ behind me, <br>
          Christ in me, Christ beneath me, Christ above me, <br>
          Christ on my right, Christ on my left, <br>
          Christ where I lie, Christ where I sit, Christ where I arise,<br>
          Christ in the heart of every man who thinks of me,<br>
          Christ in the mouth of every man who speaks of me,<br>
          Christ in every eye that sees me,<br>
          Christ in every ear that hears me.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote3anc" href="#sdfootnote3sym"><sup>3</sup></a></font></font></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So what can we know of the historical Saint Patrick? This paper will 
        first deal with what we know reliably about Patrick, and will try to reconstruct 
        his life from those sources. Unfortunately, there are still questions 
        about a number of the major events in his life, some of which we may be 
        forced to leave unsettled. Then we will look at what we can know about 
        the man himself, his beliefs and his motivations. </p>
      <h3>The Sources</h3>
      <p>Currently there are only two documents which are accepted as being written 
        by Patrick: his <i>Confession</i> and the <i>Letter to the Soldiers of 
        Coroticus</i>. There are three short statements called <i>The Sayings 
        of Patrick</i>. One of these is taken from his <i>Letter</i> but the authenticity 
        of the other two is disputed. There are two lists of canons of the early 
        Irish Church which are attributed to Patrick. The 'First Synod' is regarded 
        by some as authentically written by Patrick, but others claim a later

        The 'Second Synod' is accepted by almost all scholars as dating from the 
        early eighth century.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote5anc" href="#sdfootnote5sym"><sup>5</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
      </p>
      <p>One of the earliest writings about Patrick is the <i>Audite omnes</i>, 
        which has been dated to around 600, or slightly earlier. It is a hymn 
        of praise, written in Latin, and attributed to Secundinus, a contemporary 
        missionary to Ireland. It is extremely laudatory of Patrick, but only 
        in reference to his character and life.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote6anc" href="#sdfootnote6sym"><sup>6</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        No miracles are attributed to him. However, by the end of the seventh 
        century the &quot;lives&quot; of Patrick written by T&iacute;rech&aacute;n 
        and Muirch&uacute; are of a totally different nature. What we are presented 
        with is a Patrick who goes around performing miracles and pronouncing 
        curses on people, especially pagans who refuse to believe in Christ.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote7anc" href="#sdfootnote7sym"><sup>7</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
      </p>
      <p>These books are examples of thaumaturgy, where the miracles of a saint 
        are described, and hagiography, where the events of a saint's life are 
        connected with biblical events. It is generally acknowledged that these 
        were written in an attempt to exalt Patrick and Armagh &quot;as a focus 
        of power and authority&quot;<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote8anc" href="#sdfootnote8sym"><sup>8</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        and bring the Irish church into conformity with Rome, rather than give 
        an historically reliable account of Patrick's life. These works, and even 
        more fantastic ones written in the ninth century, gave rise to many of 
        the legends about Patrick. One of these later books, the <i>Tripartite 
        Life of Patrick</i>, gives us the most famous poem about Patrick: St. 
        Patrick's Breastplate, or the <i>Lorica</i>. This prayer is said to protect 
        those who recite it from harm, as it protected Patrick from High King 
        Laogaire. Legend has it that as soon as Patrick finished the poem, God 
        turned him into a deer so he could flee the High King. Scholars today 
        hold that someone other than Patrick composed the poem in the sixth century, 
        and it was then passed down orally for centuries.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote9anc" href="#sdfootnote9sym"><sup>9</sup></a></font></font></sup></p>
      <p>Irish monasteries recorded the major events of each year in their annals, 
        which include numerous references to Patrick. However, the first annals 
        were written down in 740, so references to dates earlier that this are 
        no longer regarded as reliable.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote10anc" href="#sdfootnote10sym"><sup>10</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        Much of the literature about Patrick gives information about the era in 
        which it was written, but has sadly resulted in a neglect of what can 
        be learned about the real Patrick due to its unrealistic nature. The most 
        reliable information which we can obtain will be from those texts known 
        to be authored by Patrick himself.</p>
      <h3>An Overview of Patrick's Life</h3>
      <p>Patrick's life can be described briefly in a way which will give an opportunity 
        to address each of the controversial questions. Patrick was born in Britain 
        towards the end of the fourth century. He was the son of Calpornius, a 
        deacon and decurion, and thus was of noble birth. He was a Roman citizen. 
        At about age sixteen, he was taken captive by Irish raiders, taken to 
        Ireland and there served six years as a slave tending sheep. It was during 
        this time that he came to know God and to believe and trust in him. At 
        the suggestion of divine messages given to him in two dreams, he traveled 
        two hundred miles to get a ship leaving Ireland. After sailing for three 
        days, they landed in a deserted place and wandered for twenty-eight days 
        before meeting other people. After spending some time with his family 
        in Britain, Patrick left, presumably to be trained as a priest. He received 
        a dream whereby a man named Victoricus came to him with letters from Ireland 
        begging him to return. While absent from Britain, he was elected bishop 
        and sent to Ireland. He had great success in winning converts, particularly 
        among the women and slaves. The sons of chieftains traveled with him. 
        All was not pleasant, though, and he was at times imprisoned, and lived 
        in fear of being attacked. At some point, his status as bishop, and honesty 
        of character, was questioned by his superiors. This caused him great distress, 
        but another divine message in a dream showed him that he was innocent 
        in God's eyes, even if not in men's. </p>
      <p>He wrote his <i>Letter</i> in reaction to an attack on an Irish settlement 
        by Coroticus, a British king, where many newly converted Christians were 
        murdered, and others taken into slavery. He denounces the actions, and 
        calls for the excommunication of the king and any of his soldiers who 
        do not repent. The <i>Confession</i> was written later in response to 
        the above inquiry. He did not want to write it, and had been putting it 
        off, but felt obliged to vindicate his name since he was now close to 
        death.</p>
      <p>This seemingly straight-forward account shrouds many controversial issues. 
        In the next section, a number of these will be addressed, with evidence 
        from Patrick's writings and other verifiable details from that time taking 
        precedent over contributions from later authors.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote11anc" href="#sdfootnote11sym"><sup>11</sup></a></font></font></sup></p>
      <h3>The Major Questions about Patrick's Life</h3>
      <h4>1. When did Patrick live?</h4>
      <p>This question has not been answered satisfactorily, but what is accepted 
        is that he lived most of his life during the fifth century. His date of 
        birth is usually estimated from dating some other time of his life. Patrick 
        tells us that he was taken captive as a slave when he was about sixteen 
        (1), and repeatedly mentions his lack of education. What he notes as lacking 
        is his knowledge of elegant Latin, rhetoric, and the law (9, 10, 13). 
        Hanson notes that this corresponds exactly with what would have been learned 
        by a student in the third part of his Roman education, the <i>rhetor</i>, 
        begun when the student was about sixteen. This suggests that the Roman 
        system was still active in Britain at the time of Patrick's youth, which 
        would place his captivity before 408, when Britain left the Roman Empire. 
        Hanson thus dates Patrick's birth to around 390. This would be consistent 
        with the traditional dates of Patrick arriving in Ireland in 432 and dying 
        in 461. </p>
      <p>His date of birth has also been estimated by dating the twenty-eight 
        day wandering. The wilderness where this occurred has been identified 
        as the path of destruction left by the Vandals in northwestern Gaul in 
        410, and would once again give Patrick a birth date around 390. This view 
        of Patrick reaching Gaul is a disputed one, and will be considered below.</p>
      <p>The other major view is based on a number of references in the annals 
        to Patrick dying in 493, which would suggest that he was born around 420-430. 
        The 17th of March is traditionally held to be the date of Patrick's death, 
        and also that he died on a Wednesday. In that year, the 17th of March 
        fell on a Wednesday. Also, many of those associated directly with Patrick 
        died in the first half of the sixth century, suggesting that he ministered 
        in Ireland in the second half of the fifth century. But, this does not 
        correspond with a number of the details in Patrick's writings which would 
        have been much more meaningful to an audience in 450-460, than one in 
        480-90. He mentions a coin, the <i>solidus</i>, which was not used in 
        Britain after 410, and also to the practice in Gaul of ransoming Christian 
        slaves from the Franks (Lett. 14), who themselves became Christians by 
        the end of the fifth century. The church in Britain was in a very strong 
        position spiritually and financially to support a mission to Patrick in 
        the first half of the fifth century, but not in the second half when Britain 
        was attacked by the Anglos and Saxons.</p>
      <p>One of the suggestions that has been made to resolve this problem is 
        that there were in fact two Patricks. There is evidence for this in the 
        annals, and received much attention through the work of O'Rahilly<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote12anc" href="#sdfootnote12sym"><sup>12</sup></a></font></font></sup>, 
        but the evidence against it today is very impressive.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote13anc" href="#sdfootnote13sym"><sup>13</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        The 493 date appears to have been created by the early hagiographers to 
        have Patrick die at age 120, thus corresponding to Moses' age when he 
        died.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote14anc" href="#sdfootnote14sym"><sup>14</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        This has served mostly to cause confusion.</p>
      <h4>2. Where was Patrick born?</h4>
      <p>Patrick tells us that he grew up in Bannavem Taberniae (1), but efforts 
        to locate this place precisely have so far failed. He tells us elsewhere 
        that he was a Briton, and a Roman citizen (Lett. 2). One place suggested 
        for this has been south-west Scotland, which would be close to Ireland 
        for raiders, and would also explain how Patrick knew Coroticus, who is 
        named as king of Dumbarton in the fifth century in Welsh annals. There 
        is a tradition in this area that Patrick was baptized in Kilpatrick, and 
        close-by is an area called Fintry. Muirch&uacute;, in a gloss, mentions 
        that Bannavem Taberniae is Ventry, which would have sounded very much 
        like Fintry.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote15anc" href="#sdfootnote15sym"><sup>15</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        Hanson acknowledges this evidence, but favors a location on the south 
        west coast of Britain due to the higher density of Roman villas known 
        to have existed in that area.</p>
      <p>An alternative location is that of modern Boulogne-sur-mer, in north-east 
        France, whose medieval name was Tarvenna or Tarabanna.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote16anc" href="#sdfootnote16sym"><sup>16</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        According to this view, Patrick was born in Britain, but his family moved 
        to Gaul when he was young. This adds evidence to Gaul being his destination 
        after he escaped from Ireland, and would allow for his Latin having a 
        Gallic tone, which has been suggested.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote17anc" href="#sdfootnote17sym"><sup>17</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        However, his family must have moved back to Britain again since Patrick 
        spent time with them there after escaping from Ireland (23) and would 
        not fit in with his wanting so much to visit Britain, &quot;my country,&quot; 
        and his kinsfolk (43). It seems to be a theory that requires much speculation 
        and fits in with other theories about his life more than it does his own 
        writings. </p>
      <h4>3. Where did Patrick serve as a slave?</h4>
      <p>The tradition location for Patrick's slavery in Slieve Mish, or Slemish, 
        in Antrim. But, the first reference to this is in Muirch&uacute;. Patrick 
        himself mentions that the letters that he received from Ireland entreating 
        him to return came from the people by the Wood of Voclut, near the Western 
        Sea. This seems to suggest a location on the Atlantic coast, and T&iacute;rech&aacute;n 
        (a native of Connacht) claims that it is near modern-day Killala in Co. 
        Mayo. Another fact from Patrick's <i>Confession</i> (17) is that he had 
        to travel two hundred miles to board his ship to freedom. This is very 
        close to the distance from Killala to the east coast of Ireland, whereas 
        if Patrick was leaving from Antrim if would seem completely unnecessary 
        for him to travel that far to get a ship.</p>
      <p>The tradition relating Patrick with Slemish appears to have arisen because 
        that is general area to which Patrick went when he returned to Ireland 
        as a missionary. Another explanation for Patrick going to the northeast 
        could be that he wanted to go to the main center of the Ulaid, the clan 
        which had once ruled all of Ulster and Meath, but were at this time loosing 
        their territory to the Airgialla and the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote18anc" href="#sdfootnote18sym"><sup>18</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        The ancient royal center of the Ulaid was at Emain Macha, just a couple 
        of miles from Armagh which has been regarded, without dispute, as the 
        principle church founded by Patrick. He may have decided to go to the 
        Ulaid because there were no Christians with them, whereas there is evidence 
        of Christianity being present in the south and east of Ireland before 
        Patrick (see below). Patrick makes it clear in his writings that he brought 
        the gospel to those who had not heard it before (34, 38, 41). Muirch&uacute; 
        gives the name of Patrick's supposed master in Slemish as Miliucc, but 
        there is a place called Miliucc in the parish of Killala.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote19anc" href="#sdfootnote19sym"><sup>19</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        This may reflect a distant memory of Patrick being a slave in the west 
        of Ireland.</p>
      <h4>4. Where did Patrick sail to from Ireland?</h4>
      <p>After Patrick boarded his ship from Ireland, he sailed for three days 
        and reached land in a desolate place where the ship's party wandered for 
        twenty-eight days before meeting other people. There are two views as 
        to where this wandered occurred: the traditional view that it was in the 
        northwest of Gaul, and the other view is that it was in Britain. A wilderness 
        area large enough to take twenty-eight days to cross could only be satisfied 
        by some part of Gaul which had been decimated by raiding barbarians between 
        407 and 410.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote20anc" href="#sdfootnote20sym"><sup>20</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        This would then provide a way to date Patrick's early life.</p>
      <p>But, why would Patrick sail for Gaul, when his dream specifically told 
        him that he would soon be going to his <i>patria</i>, or homeland (17)? 
        It is also extremely unlikely that a small Irish ship (the ship's captain 
        is called a <i>gubernator</i>, a term used for the master of the smallest 
        of the four types of sea-going craft) could make the coast of Gaul in 
        three days.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote21anc" href="#sdfootnote21sym"><sup>21</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
      </p>
      <p>Instead, the ship may have landed in Britain, and the men wandered through 
        a heavily wooded area. The word for wilderness, <i>desertum</i>, simply 
        means an uninhabited place. The firewood, shelter and wood-honey found 
        by the men during the latter part of their wanderings all suggest that 
        they were in woods (19). They could easily have walked in circles through 
        the woods for days. The word used for the pigs they found is <i>porcus</i>, 
        which is the word for domestic pigs. These would have been released to 
        fend for themselves off the mast of oak and beech which fall to the forest 
        floor in autumn.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote22anc" href="#sdfootnote22sym"><sup>22</sup></a></font></font></sup></p>
      <p>One criticism of this view is that it did not take three days to cross 
        the Irish Sea, even in those days. This has been explained in two different 
        ways. One views the ship as a trading ship with a cargo of dogs which 
        end up lying half-dead during the wanderings. The word translated &quot;dogs&quot; 
        is uncertain due to poor manuscript quality, and thus makes for shaky 
        grounds to base a theory on. In addition, the captain is viewed as changing 
        his mind to allow Patrick on board when he realizes that he would make 
        a good interpreter to have with him in Britain. The ship then takes three 
        days to reach Britain because it gets caught in a storm and wrecks on 
        the coast. This is supported by the fact that many of the terms used by 
        Patrick in his account (19) suggest that it took great effort for the 
        party to reach land.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote23anc" href="#sdfootnote23sym"><sup>23</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        Also, Patrick later states that he only just escaped from Ireland (61). 
        If this is what happened, it would seem to be a glaring omission on Patrick's 
        part not to mention anything about the storm, especially since his theme 
        in this section of the book is God's deliverance, and the reality of answered 
        prayer. </p>
      <p>The other view is that Patrick boarded a raiding ship, which took a circuitous 
        route to its destination to avoid detection.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote24anc" href="#sdfootnote24sym"><sup>24</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        This would explain why all the men left the ship in a deserted area, but 
        then subsequently got lost. I find it very doubtful that a man of Patrick's 
        integrity would board a pirate ship, especially knowing that these men 
        were about to inflict on others what he had just endured for the previous 
        six years. It is also questionable that raiders would have taken Patrick 
        with them, either not trusting him, or more likely turning him in as a 
        runaway slave in the hope of making some money from him. </p>
      <p>This question particularly seems to lead to no clear answer, other than 
        that Patrick's destination was Britain.</p>
      <h4>5. Where was Patrick educated?</h4>
      <p>After spending some years with his family, Patrick decides to answer 
        the call of his dreams to go to Ireland. But first, he must have received 
        some clerical education to become a priest and then a bishop. The traditional 
        view is that this was received on the continent, either in L&eacute;rin 
        or Auxerre, and that Patrick was then sent by Rome as a bishop to Ireland. 
        But, recent studies are showing that this does not fit in with Patrick's 
        writings or the policies of Rome in those days. Unfortunately, the information 
        about the strength of the connection between Ireland and Rome is over-shadowed 
        by the biases of the researchers:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> The debate [over the extent of differences] is complicated by the 
          ecclesiastical views of the writers, modern Roman Catholics tending 
          to emphasize the Roman connection and Anglicans to belittle it.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote25anc" href="#sdfootnote25sym"><sup>25</sup></a></font></font></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>On the issue of Patrick's writings, it is now recognized that these represent 
        the earliest significant works known in the Vulgar Latin of Britain, and 
        not of Gaul, as earlier thought.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote26anc" href="#sdfootnote26sym"><sup>26</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        In fact, Patrick provides a unique, early source of information on British 
        Latin which has been neglected until recently because of the view that 
        his Latin was of Gallic origin. If Patrick had been educated on the continent, 
        he would be expected to have a very polished Latin, and great knowledge 
        of the Church Fathers and his contemporary, Augustine. In fact, Patrick 
        reveals none of this. According to two recent scholars, the first in the 
        area of literary knowledge and the second in linguistics:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> [I]t would seem to the present writer that, so far as literary (as 
          distinct from linguistic and other) evidence is concerned, the testimony 
          of the <i>Confessio</i> is almost decisively against Patrick (who was 
          clearly no dullard) having been exposed over a long period, not only 
          to the <i>Confessiones</i> [of Augustine], but to any literary influence 
          in any relatively cultured ecclesiastical centre such as existed at 
          the time in Gaul.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote27anc" href="#sdfootnote27sym"><sup>27</sup></a></font></font></sup></p>
        <p> There are, as far as I can see, in Patrick's works no traces of quotations 
          or borrowings from any other book than the Bible. We can assert that 
          Patrick was, so far as we can gather from his works, a man <i>unius 
          libri</i>. His only book was Holy Scripture.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote28anc" href="#sdfootnote28sym"><sup>28</sup></a></font></font></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Since Patrick did not have a solid education in Latin or the church Fathers, 
        it is very unlikely that he would have been appointed by Rome for any 
        episcopal task. In addition, Patrick makes it very clear that his mission 
        is to the pagans in Ireland, missionary activity to the barbarians was 
        not carried out by the church in Rome at that time, and was even frowned 
        upon due to the view that the barbarians were less than fully human.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote29anc" href="#sdfootnote29sym"><sup>29</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
      </p>
      <p>So, it appears more likely that Patrick was educated mostly in Britain, 
        and that upon their suggestion and funding, he was sent as a missionary 
        to Ireland. There is precedent for the British church doing this in sending 
        Ninian to evangelize in southwest Scotland during the first half of the 
        fifth century.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote30anc" href="#sdfootnote30sym"><sup>30</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        Patrick addresses much of the content of his <i>Confession</i> to the 
        elders in Britain, and it is to them that he appears to be accountable. 
        Also, when his authority as bishop was questioned, if he had been appointed 
        by Rome, he would only need to have referred to this, and the issue would 
        have been settled once and for all. But he does not do this.</p>
      <p>The tradition of Patrick's connection with the continent, and Rome, did 
        not arise until late in the seventh century when the Irish church was 
        being brought into conformity with the Roman church. There appears to 
        have been substantial differences between the two which led to the excommunication 
        of the Irish church by the Pope according to Cummian of Iona in a letter 
        written early in the seventh century.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote31anc" href="#sdfootnote31sym"><sup>31</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        Many of the practices of the two churches were different, with the dating 
        of Easter being the issue that received most attention. In addition, the 
        power in the Irish church lay in the hands of the abbots, whereas in the 
        rest of the Western church the power lay with the bishops. The church 
        in the southern part of Ireland appears to have conformed by 640, but 
        the northerners held out for another fifty years. Part of this settlement 
        seems to have involved granting Armagh the primacy of Ireland, based simply 
        on its unquestioned association with Patrick. It was at this point that 
        T&iacute;rech&aacute;n and Muirch&uacute; wrote their lives of Patrick 
        which sought to portray Patrick as a bishop sent by Rome, and adhering 
        faithfully to Roman practices. It is also at this point that events in 
        Patrick's life may have been mixed up with events in the life of Palladius, 
        another bishop sent to Ireland.</p>
      <h4>6. Was Patrick the only missionary in Ireland?</h4>
      <p>An additional source of information on Ireland at this time is Prosper 
        of Aquitaine. In his history of the church from 423 to 461, he records 
        under 431: &quot;Palladius, ordained by Pope Celestine, is sent to the 
        Scotti who believe in Christ, as their first bishop.&quot;<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote32anc" href="#sdfootnote32sym"><sup>32</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        The Scotti are acknowledged to have been the Irish. Palladius was a highly 
        influential priest in Rome at that time, and had been actively involved 
        in suppressing the Pelagian heresy. It was at his suggestion that Celestine, 
        in 429, sent Germanus to Britain to stamp out any Pelagianism there. The 
        mystery is that Palladius disappears from history at this point. The only 
        indirect evidence to his fate in Ireland is a later reference of Prosper's 
        to the career of Celestine: &quot;By ordaining a bishop for the Scotti, 
        while he strove to keep the Roman island Catholic he also made the barbarous 
        island Christian.&quot;<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote33anc" href="#sdfootnote33sym"><sup>33</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        This has been taken by one author to show that Palladius primary goal 
        was to counteract Pelagianism by getting an orthodox bishop into a see 
        in that area.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote34anc" href="#sdfootnote34sym"><sup>34</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        Nevertheless, Palladius must have carried out his responsibilities in 
        Ireland, and he is associated with some places in Leinster.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that Palladius was sent to the Irish Christians. 
        No pope before Gregory the Great (d. 604) took a lead in missions. Pope 
        Celestine himself had declared that a bishop had to be wanted by a group 
        of Christians before one would be sent.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote35anc" href="#sdfootnote35sym"><sup>35</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        This implies that there must have been some sort of organization to the 
        church in Ireland before 431. It is unlikely that this came about through 
        the work of missionaries, but probably resulted from the bringing of Christian 
        slaves from Britain. Patrick notes that many other slaves were captured 
        with him (1), and there is evidence of Latin words entering the Irish 
        language as earlier as the fourth century. It is possible that some of 
        these slaves converted their masters to Christianity, as happened when 
        the Goths took Christian slaves back to their homelands.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote36anc" href="#sdfootnote36sym"><sup>36</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        In any case, these Christians were living in Ireland and received the 
        first bishop to Ireland, Palladius. After that, nothing is known of him. 
        But, the names of a number of clergy (Secundinus, Auxilius and Iserninus) 
        which would appear to be of continental origin have been passed down in 
        the names of places in Ireland, and later written records.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote37anc" href="#sdfootnote37sym"><sup>37</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        Patrick himself, when he states that he went to areas where no one had 
        penetrated to minister (51), implicitly suggests that there were other 
        areas in Ireland which did have clergy baptizing and ordaining. If this 
        is the case, there must have been other bishops present to do the ordinations. 
        It is of interest that Patrick never claims to be the first bishop of 
        Ireland, and even states that he is &quot;a bishop&quot; in Ireland (Lett. 
        1) not <i>the</i> bishop of Ireland. There is also a sense of isolation 
        and single-handed leadership in Patrick's writings, which would have occurred 
        if he was left to work in the north and west of Ireland, while the continental 
        group focused on the south and east. This corresponds well with the pattern 
        seen in the seventh century when the southern parts were quicker to align 
        with Roman practices than the northern parts.</p>
      <h4>7. Why was Patrick's integrity questioned?</h4>
      <p>The sense of division between Patrick and the continental mission has 
        been developed to the point of giving an explanation for the conflict 
        which led to the inquiry which so devastated Patrick later in his life.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote38anc" href="#sdfootnote38sym"><sup>38</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        It is suggested that Patrick's approach was so different to the continental 
        approach, that conflict was inevitable. So, the 'First Synod' was drawn 
        up to legislate primarily against Patrick! Patrick responds to many of 
        these issues in the <i>Confession</i>, but also notes that he will not 
        abide by some. This is certainly a novel theory, and even includes the 
        suggestion that the conflict was covered up at the end of the seventh 
        century for political reasons. At this time, the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill 
        were taking over political control of much of the north and saw it in 
        their interests to have Armagh established as the ecclesiastical primacy 
        in Ireland. For this purpose, a heroic Patrick with firm ties to Armagh 
        and Rome was needed, and they saw to it that any record of conflict between 
        Patrick and the continental mission was suppressed. It is of note that 
        in the Book of Armagh, copied in 807, those portions of Patrick's <i>Confession</i> 
        which deal with this inquiry have been left out. This would also shed 
        some light on the strange fact that there is almost no mention of Patrick 
        during the sixth century, and that it is only during this seventh century 
        controversy that mention of him reappears. It has also been suggested 
        that Secundinus, one of the continental bishops, composed the hymn <i>Audite 
        omnes</i> to atone for his criticism of Patrick during this affair.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote39anc" href="#sdfootnote39sym"><sup>39</sup></a></font></font></sup></p>
      <p>There have certainly been less extravagant theories as to what led to 
        this inquiry. One is that Patrick's letter to Coroticus led to his authority 
        being questioned, particularly if Coroticus was a king with influence 
        in the British church.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote40anc" href="#sdfootnote40sym"><sup>40</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        If Coroticus was a Scottish king, the bishop of his diocese may have been 
        insulted that another bishop would excommunicate some of his flock, and 
        thus brought up the issue with the other British bishops.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote41anc" href="#sdfootnote41sym"><sup>41</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        Another possibility is that Patrick's handling of the finances were being 
        questioned, and that this escalated into a wholesale questioning of his 
        character and motivations.</p>
      <p>In any event, it turned out that Patrick was vindicated, and his faith 
        in God was strengthened (29). Nevertheless, it was an affair that deeply 
        shook Patrick, and remained in his memory for the rest of his life.</p>
      <h4>8. Summary of Patrick's Life</h4>
      <p>From all of these controversies I will give what I see as a reasonable 
        summary of Patrick's life. He was born around 390 and brought up in Britain, 
        probably in southwest Scotland, but southwest England is also likely. 
        He was taken to Ireland when he was sixteen, and tended sheep for six 
        years near Killala. At the suggestion of a divine dream, he made his way 
        across Ireland to the east coast and there caught a ship to Britain. After 
        three days they made land, possibly being delayed by bad weather. After 
        wandering in dense forest for twenty-eight days they were found by others 
        and eventually Patrick made it home to his family. He remained with them 
        for a few years, and then decided to pursue the priesthood in answer to 
        dreams he had about returning to Ireland. After a number of years, while 
        he was on a short visit to the continent, probably Gaul, his name was 
        proposed to lead a missionary expedition to Ireland. He set out around 
        432 as a bishop, and went to the headquarters of the Ulaid in Emain Macha, 
        and there established his first church at what is now Armagh. From there 
        he traveled predominantly in the north and west and made many converts, 
        and trained many priests. After some time, his integrity was questioned, 
        resulting in an inquiry at the hands of the British bishops, but he was 
        subsequently vindicated. As the Ulaid were pushed out of more and more 
        territory, Patrick moved with them to spend his last days in Down, from 
        which he wrote his <i>Confession</i>. He died around 460.</p>
      <h3>Patrick's Character and Beliefs</h3>
      <p>An unfortunate fact of history is that Patrick's beliefs have been sought 
        more often to justify the beliefs of the researcher than to honestly appraise 
        what Patrick really believed. Thus he has been used to support the existence 
        of a continuous link between the Irish church and Rome, and to show that 
        there was great conflict between the two. Archbishop Ussher in the seventeenth 
        century tried to establish that Protestantism was a return to the ways 
        of Patrick, while others have claimed him for Catholicism. Patrick has 
        also been claimed as a mystic, an ascetic, a Pelagian, and an anti-Pelagian. 
        What is obvious is that the presuppositions of authors bear a major impact 
        on what is interpreted as Patrick's beliefs. Therefore, it is with much 
        caution that I attempt to extract some of the major themes in Patrick's 
        writings, acknowledging that my own views will bias what I see, but praying 
        that I can be as honest to the real Patrick as possible.</p>
      <p>Patrick's <i>Confession</i> gives us most of the information about his 
        views and beliefs. In the last two chapters, Patrick explains once again 
        why he has written: to show that his motives in going to Ireland were 
        only to spread the gospel (61), and to show that all the glory for what 
        he accomplished should go to God because it was all a gift of God's (62). 
        These themes reverberate throughout the book. Again and again Patrick 
        thanks God for what he has given him. He is now able to see that even 
        his being taken as a slave was done so that God bring him to a point where 
        they could initiate a relationship (1-3). It was while a slave that Patrick 
        was to be strengthened and comforted by God &quot;as a father comforts 
        his son&quot; (2). Everything that Patrick did in Ireland as a missionary 
        was a result of God's gift to him (51), and because of that Patrick wants 
        to praise and thank God (3) and let everyone know of God's gift to them 
        (14).</p>
      <p>Patrick knows that much has been accomplished by his work in Ireland 
        (38, 41), and yet we are struck by his humility. Nowhere does he try to 
        hide the fact that he has made mistakes (46). He is open about the fact 
        that early in his life he committed some sin that later got his superiors 
        upset (26). He declares repeatedly that he is uneducated, and that his 
        Latin is not polished (1, 9, Lett. 1). He claims to be completely unworthy 
        of the fruit that has resulted from his work (55). Hanson interprets this 
        humility as a strong sense of inadequacy and inferiority which was inflicted 
        on Patrick's soul by the trauma of his slavery.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote42anc" href="#sdfootnote42sym"><sup>42</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        While there may be some truth to this, it is more likely that Patrick 
        is living out in his life the experience of 2 Corinthians 12:7-10. Jesus' 
        words to Paul that &quot;power is perfected in weakness&quot; have spoken 
        mightily to Patrick also, who now sees an opportunity to experience God 
        working in his life when he thinks of his own inadequacies. Patrick knows 
        how easily one can be deceived (44) and moved away from a proper attitude 
        towards God, and hence his weaknesses and failings serve as continual 
        reminders of his need for dependence on God.</p>
      <p>What is of primary importance in Patrick's life is his relationship with 
        God. What was missing in his early youth was that he &quot;did not then 
        know the true God&quot; (1) but as a slave he came to know him. His goal 
        in life since that point has been to grow in the love and fear of God 
        (16, 44). His rule of faith (4) shows that he had an orthodox view of 
        God, but scattered throughout the rest of the book we pick up traces of 
        the depth and intimacy of Patrick's relationship with God. Patrick sees 
        him as a father (2), as one who protects him from all evil (33), as one 
        who gets him through tough times (34), as a forgiving God (44, 46), and 
        as faithful (54, 56). In summary, God is someone whom you can cast your 
        cares upon, and trust to nourish you (55). This depth and intimacy was 
        been a characteristic feature of the early Irish church, and was probably 
        helped by the fact that a king in Irish society was at least physically 
        close to the people, and not the distant, unfamiliar type of person suggested 
        by modern royalty.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote43anc" href="#sdfootnote43sym"><sup>43</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
      </p>
      <p>Patrick communicated with God through prayer, dreams and the Bible. Prayer 
        was of central importance to Patrick. As a slave he prayed a hundred times 
        a day, rising before dawn regardless of the weather (16). This chapter 
        seems to start a section of the book which culminates in his amazing experience 
        of seeing the Holy Spirit pray within him, just as Paul did (Romans 8:26). 
        What becomes clear from this section is that God truly does answer prayer, 
        particularly in difficult situations. Patrick then immediately jumps into 
        the section about the inquiry into his integrity (26-34), when he was 
        most depressed, and shows that it was God who got him through this. Since 
        Patrick tells us later that the converts in Ireland were enduring suffering 
        (42), he may be letting them know how they can endure through these, and 
        in fact grow closer to God as a result of prayer. In fact, his whole story 
        would be an encouragement to Christians, like those carried off by Coroticus, 
        who were enduring tough times.</p>
      <p>Patrick tells us that he received a number of divine dreams which O'Donoghue 
        claims were, for Patrick, part of the normal Christian life.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote44anc" href="#sdfootnote44sym"><sup>44</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        While we today may reject alternate modes of communication with God too 
        quickly, all of these dreams occurred at important points in Patrick's 
        life. In an age when the Bible, or missionaries, were not as accessible 
        as they are today, it is reasonable to assume that God worked more often 
        in this way, but does not require that they be a frequent event. O'Donoghue 
        does point out that Patrick's dreams were very different from those written 
        about the later saints. The latter were often mysterious and fantastic, 
        but Patrick's dreams are clear and concise, needing no interpretation. 
        They were heard and not seen. Also, the word used for all but the first 
        dream is <i>responsum</i>, which suggests a divine response to prayer, 
        and thus links these in with Patrick's prayer life. </p>
      <p>What is most clear from Patrick's writings is that he had an intimate 
        knowledge of the Bible. His <i>Confession</i> is full of quotations from, 
        and allusions to, the Bible. For Patrick there was only one book, the 
        Bible. He states that he believed the Bible was given by the Spirit (11), 
        that it foretells things about the future (34), and that there is nothing 
        untrue in it (Lett. 20). This would count as an orthodox statement of 
        inspiration. Patrick's knowledge and love of the Bible is one of the two 
        features repeatedly praised in the hymn <i>Audite omnes</i>.</p>
      <p>In applying the Bible, Patrick is very straight-forward, and practical, 
        though at times he does stretch the meaning of the text (e.g. 11). This 
        became the standard method of interpretation and exegesis used in the 
        early Irish church. While the rest of the church was interpreting the 
        Bible allegorically, the Irish church remained faithful to literal-historical 
        interpretation.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote45anc" href="#sdfootnote45sym"><sup>45</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        While allegory was sought to some extent, the emphasis was on what the 
        text had meant originally, and on how it applied in a common-sense, practical 
        manner to the life of the Christian.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote46anc" href="#sdfootnote46sym"><sup>46</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        In addition, there was great respect for the Bible, and it was the main 
        book studied in Irish monasteries to the neglect of philosophical theology. 
        It must be one of the great tragedies that this did not continue, but 
        faded away as the monasteries in Ireland were ransacked by the Vikings 
        and the allegorical and philosophical emphasis gained greater influence 
        on the Continent.</p>
      <p>Another unique aspect of Irish biblical studies was their frequent use 
        of the works of Pelagius at a time when no other interpreters were using 
        him. Pelagius (d. 444) was a Briton living in Rome who rejected Augustine's 
        notion of predestination and his negative view of human nature.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote47anc" href="#sdfootnote47sym"><sup>47</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        He promoted the idea that all people are born in a morally perfect condition, 
        and have the potential to live sinless lives if they consistently use 
        their free will to choose good. He thus emphasized good works, and promoted 
        asceticism, claiming that our tendency to sin comes from bad habits and 
        bad example. In 418 his works were declared heretical and he was excommunicated.</p>
      <p>Pelagius' works were avoided by all except the Irish monks. In fact, 
        the Irish have been linked to every reference to Pelagius in the early 
        Middle Ages. It has been suggested that this was due to a Pelagian stronghold 
        in Ireland, some even suggesting that Pelagius was Irish. Pelagianism 
        was present in Britain early in the fifth century, though to what extent 
        has been difficult to ascertain.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote48anc" href="#sdfootnote48sym"><sup>48</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        It did necessitate the sending of Germanus in 428, and possibly again 
        in 444, to eliminate it. Since this is the period when Patrick would have 
        been educated in Britain, it has been suggested that Patrick may have 
        been influenced by Pelagianism, even bringing it to Ireland and thus giving 
        it credibility among later Irish monks. This theory has been rejected 
        by a study of the citations of Pelagius' works in Irish manuscript.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote49anc" href="#sdfootnote49sym"><sup>49</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        In this study, Kelly claims that Pelagius was used because his exegetical 
        methodology was favored by the Irish, but that nowhere was his theology 
        promoted. In addition, Pelagius was known to have lived a virtuous life, 
        which even Augustine, his archrival, acknowledged. This was very important 
        to the Irish monks who were renowned for their emphasis on inner moral 
        transformation, asceticism, and strict penance.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote50anc" href="#sdfootnote50sym"><sup>50</sup></a></font></font></sup></p>
      <p>Although Patrick does not claim to have been an ascetic, or a monk, he 
        notes that many were committing themselves to that lifestyle and is very 
        positive towards them (41-2). He does emphasize the need for action on 
        the part of Christians. But what we have in Patrick is not the emphasis 
        on works by human effort that was found in Pelagianism, but rather he 
        saw everything as a gift of God's. The opportunity to come to Ireland 
        as a missionary was a gift (15) and all the works he accomplished were 
        gifts (37, 51) done by the power of God (30). Patrick even asks why he 
        would be given the honor of serving people in such a profound way (36), 
        and his only conclusion is that it had nothing to do with him, only God 
        (37). All that was required of Patrick was that he focus on his relationship 
        with God (42) and be willing to serve (57). This would bring inner transformation 
        (13) and would draw people to Christ (30). With this attitude there is 
        no way that Patrick could have seen his salvation as having anything to 
        do with his good works, but being yet another gift from God (Ephesians 
        2:8-9).</p>
      <p>What we see here is not the works mentality of Pelagianism, or the irresistible 
        grace seen in Augustine, but rather something that comes closer to what 
        became known in the seventeenth century as semi-Pelagianism. Much of what 
        constitutes this view was developed by John Cassian (d. 433) while he 
        lived in Marseilles.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote51anc" href="#sdfootnote51sym"><sup>51</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        He was definitely not a Pelagian, but he reacted to Augustine's view of 
        predestination because he felt that it violated the need for effort on 
        the part of Christians. He placed a heavy emphasis on asceticism and good 
        works, but in almost contradictory terms stated that everything was done 
        by God's grace. What is needed is our desire to do good, and then God 
        does it all:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> It is given to them that ask, and opened to them that knock, and found 
          by them that seek... For [God] is at hand to bestow all these things, 
          if only the opportunity is given to him by our good will.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote52anc" href="#sdfootnote52sym"><sup>52</sup></a></font></font></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In many ways, Cassian's views are lived out in Patrick. Cassian believed 
        that asceticism led to the removal of obstacles in our lives which hinder 
        the flow of grace to us from God. Whenever pride attacks, the soul needs 
        to realize that it depends on God, which is almost exactly what Patrick 
        did (37). The grace of God leads to a strong emphasis on prayer (16-25). 
        Cassian even spoke highly of dreams as a means by which God communicates 
        messages to individuals, and gave them interpretations of Scripture.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote53anc" href="#sdfootnote53sym"><sup>53</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        Cassian had been a disciple of John of Chrysostom, and came from the east 
        in 405. With him he carried the traditions and theology of the Eastern 
        monks, which has been noted to be curiously present in Irish monasticism. 
        Cassian's impact on later Irish monks has been noted,<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote54anc" href="#sdfootnote54sym"><sup>54</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        but I have not read of his impact directly on Patrick. Cassian is associated 
        with Vincent of L&eacute;rin, and Faustus, abbot of L&eacute;rin and later 
        Bishop of Riez. L&eacute;rin is one of the continental sites that has 
        traditionally been associated with Patrick. It may be that he did spend 
        some time with these men, or at least was influenced by their works. Since 
        they did not emphasize complicated theological doctrines, but a way of 
        life, it would not have been necessary for Patrick to have spent a long 
        period of time with them to have grasped much of their ideas. He may also 
        have picked up their emphasis on Scripture too, and thus would have had 
        the same source materials as they. Another quote from Cassian will serve 
        to show how much Patrick's life-style reflects Cassian's teaching:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> We may first show to our brethren true humility from the very bottom 
          of our heart, assenting to nothing which will sadden or hurt... Then, 
          next after this, we must maintain with the utmost firmness this same 
          humility towards God. And this will be fulfilled by us in such a way 
          as not only to acknowledge that we are powerless to accomplish anything 
          relating to the perfecting of virtue without his assistance and grace, 
          but we also believe honestly that our being worthy to comprehend this 
          is in fact a gift from him.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote55anc" href="#sdfootnote55sym"><sup>55</sup></a></font></font></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>What results from this in Patrick is a deep concern for others, but also 
        a realization that only God can meet their true needs. From this comes 
        his missionary zeal. While still a non-believer, Patrick saw that God 
        had taken notice of him, and pitied, protected and strengthened him so 
        that he would come to see his sin, repent and believe in the Lord (2). 
        This was reflected in Patrick's attitude towards the pagan Irish, as he 
        saw them as people needing Christ, not as evil barbarians beyond redemption. 
        This attitude remained in the early Irish church, but had changed to one 
        of intolerance by the end of the seventh century.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote56anc" href="#sdfootnote56sym"><sup>56</sup></a></font></font></sup></p>
      <p>This attitude, coupled with an emphasis on God's grace, prayer and Scripture 
        must have accounted for much of Patrick's success. For him, what was most 
        important was not strategies or structures, but that he present an image 
        which reflected God's image and was one that should be imitated (47). 
        Thus he reflects Paul's command to imitate him as he imitates Christ (1 
        Corinthians 11:1). That Patrick was a virtuous man is the second of the 
        main themes developed in the hymn <i>Audite omnes</i>. This now makes 
        it even more apparent why the inquiry into Patrick's character so devastated 
        him. He had lived his adult life pursuing Christ and thus becoming more 
        Christ-like, and saw this vindicated in the fact that thousands had come 
        to know Christ and be born again in Christ as a result of his witness 
        (38, 42). Now, some others were apparently claiming that all this had 
        occurred from selfish motives and for personal gain, while claiming that 
        Patrick was a liar. Not only must this have hurt, but it must have caused 
        Patrick to question whether his whole life really was the way he had been 
        looking on it. If Patrick's character was defamed, he must have feared 
        that much of his effectiveness as a missionary would be lost. But once 
        again, God comes through in a dream to vindicate him completely and show 
        him that in God's eyes he had been faithful (29).</p>
      <p>What we see in Patrick is a man with deep affection and respect for all 
        people. He saw the pagans as people in need of Christ. This was given 
        an urgent appeal as he saw Ireland as the last place on earth to be reached 
        for Christ (38), which would then result in the end of history (34). He 
        was also deeply respectful of women, and mentions them specifically in 
        admiring ways (41, 49, Lett. 12, 14). He has none of that &quot;neurotic 
        fear of and contempt for the feminine&quot;<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote57anc" href="#sdfootnote57sym"><sup>57</sup></a></font></font></sup> 
        which entered the church so early. His life was changed when he came to 
        believe in God. He knows that he will spend eternity with God (12) and 
        is overcome with thankfulness. His works are seen as a gift and privilege, 
        not as a way to win God's favor or his salvation (15, 38). &Oacute; Raifeartaigh 
        summarizes Patrick's life well:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> In short he was the ideal missionary, highly successful but never 
          for a moment attributing to himself the credit thereof.<sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size=1><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote58anc" href="#sdfootnote58sym"><sup>58</sup></a></font></font></sup></p>

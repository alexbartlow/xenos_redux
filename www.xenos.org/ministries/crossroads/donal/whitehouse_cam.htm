      <h2><a name="Executivesummary"></a>Executive summary </h2>
      <p>While the Report endorses the evaluative approach known as evidence-based 
        medicine, it acknowledges that proponents of CAM frequently do not adhere 
        to those principles. CAM courses in medical schools often promote CAM 
        rather than critically evaluate it. Unfortunately, the Report itself frequently 
        violates the very evidence-based principles it endorses. Several specific 
        examples will be given. The lack of diversity in the Commission&#146;s 
        composition is most clearly reflected here. The sweeping recommendations 
        of the Report thus fail to prioritize where resources should be directed 
        and how those priorities should be determined.</p>
      <p>Problems with the Report&#146;s broad recommendations are most apparent 
        with spirituality. The Report treats spirituality like another therapy, 
        failing to recognize its deeply personal and sensitive nature. Neither 
        does the Report address the difficulties of addressing spiritual concerns 
        within healthcare. Spirituality should not be treated as a generic therapy. 
        The Report does not address the training of healthcare professionals to 
        appropriately and ethically address spirituality, nor does it tackle the 
        way some CAM therapies disguise their religious roots. In neglecting these 
        issues, the Report contributes to such covert promotion of religious practices. 
        The Report similarly fails to address the use of federal funds in promoting 
        spiritual practices or specific religions. This paper will propose ways 
        to address spiritual issues ethically within healthcare. </p>
      <p>In summary, the Report&#146;s all-encompassing recommendations are too 
        broad and impractical. The Report recognized how evidence-based principles 
        can recognize and promote the best within CAM, but then failed to adhere 
        to this approach itself. The Report missed an important opportunity to 
        promote dialogue on difficult but important issues surrounding CAM by 
        taking an advocacy position. A more nuanced approach was needed, in which 
        different criteria are used to evaluate different forms of CAM therapies. 
        Without this, the public will continue to be exposed to unproven, unsafe 
        CAM therapies, and public funds will be used in inappropriate and unjust 
        ways.</p>
      <h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
      <p>In March 2000, President Bill Clinton established the White House Commission 
        on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy (WHCCAMP). The Commission&#146;s 
        mission was to provide recommendations that would ensure that public policy 
        maximizes the potential benefits of complementary and alternative medicine 
        (CAM). Specifically, the mission was to address:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <p>education and training of health care practitioners in CAM,</p>
        <li> 
          <p>coordination of research to increase knowledge about CAM products,</p>
        <li> 
          <p>provision of reliable and useful information on CAM to healthcare 
            professions, and</p>
        <li> 
          <p>provision of guidance on the appropriate access to and delivery of 
            CAM.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p>
      </ul>
      <p>The twenty-member Commission held ten meetings and solicited input from 
        various healthcare professions and the public. Its Final Report was released 
        in March 2002 and will be referred to hereafter as the Report. </p>
      <p>Included within the Report was a letter to the Secretary of the Department 
        of Health and Human Services from two of the Commissioners, Tieraona Low 
        Dog, M.D. and Joseph J. Fins, M.D. These Commissioners expressed important 
        concerns about the Report. In particular, they claimed that the Report 
        did not adequately appreciate the limitations of unproven and unvalidated 
        CAM interventions, and did not pay enough attention to the importance 
        of minimizing CAM risks. This letter adds important qualifying remarks 
        to the Report and will be referred to in this paper as the dissenting 
        letter.</p>
      <h2><a name="CAMDefinition"></a>CAM Definition</h2>
      <p>The definition of CAM adopted by the Report is the following: &#147;Complementary 
        and alternative medicine, or CAM, can be defined as a group of medical, 
        health care, and healing systems other than those included in mainstream 
        health care in the United States. CAM includes the worldviews, theories, 
        modalities, products, and practices associated with these systems and 
        their use to treat illness and promote health and well-being.&#148; </p>
      <p>This is a representative definition of CAM, but as such adopts problems 
        inherent with such far-reaching and all-encompassing definitions. CAM, 
        then, as used in the Report, stands for everything from the religious-philosophical 
        system of traditional Chinese medicine to individual herbal remedies. 
        While this accurately represents what is viewed as CAM, it leads to serious 
        problems when public policy is based on such a broad definition. </p>
      <p>For example, public policy regarding the production and distribution 
        of herbal remedies should look very different to that regarding people&#146;s 
        philosophical or religious beliefs and practices. Public policy must approach 
        health-related practices that invoke spiritual beings (like prayer, shamanism, 
        or Reiki) differently than it does acupuncture and nutrition. The importance 
        of these distinctions was not appreciated or addressed in the Report. 
        As two of the Commissioners stated in their dissenting letter, &#147;In 
        sum, generic pronouncements about &#145;CAM&#146; neither serve the public 
        interest nor protect the public health.&#148; A recommendation that CAM 
        be researched or covered by insurance or taught in medical school provides 
        little or no practical guidance for those who have to decide which forms 
        of CAM are deserving of such policies.</p>
      <p>The other definitional approach taken in the Report was to describe the 
        general characteristics of CAM. Four characteristics were suggested: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> 
          <p>CAM commonly approaches patients in ways that include &#147;a focus 
            on individualized treatments, treating the whole person, promoting 
            self-care and self-healing, and recognizing the spiritual nature of 
            each individual.&#148;</p>
        <li> 
          <p>CAM frequently has much in common with aspects of conventional medicine, 
            such as nutrition and preventive healthcare. </p>
        <li> 
          <p>CAM therapies usually have little support from scientific study and 
            clinical research.</p>
        <li> 
          <p>CAM therapies often focus on &#147;the prevention of illness by enhancing 
            the vital energy, or subtle forces, in the body.&#148; </p>
      </ol>
      <p>Again, these characteristics are so unspecific that they provide little 
        guidance in distinguishing CAM from conventional medicine. These same 
        characteristics have been reported before by the author of this paper, 
        while acknowledging their practical limitations for evaluating CAM.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
      <p>Another problem with the Report&#146;s approach arises because of the 
        significant overlap between conventional medicine and CAM as defined in 
        the Report. The only examples of CAM therapies that the Report specifies 
        as being proven safe and effective are exercise, nutrition, and stress 
        management. But these interventions have been evaluated and affirmed within 
        conventional medicine. Why then should they be used as support for the 
        benefits of CAM? Many of the characteristics of CAM listed in the Report 
        are completely compatible with conventional medicine. In fact, the medical 
        ethics literature contains many calls for an emphasis on many of these 
        approaches as part of the art of medicine and the importance of bedside 
        manner. If these practices should characterize all forms of medicine, 
        their ascription to CAM does nothing to help clarify what is meant by 
        CAM.</p>
      <p>To give practical guidance and direction, broad definitions and lists 
        of characteristics are severely limited. For this reason, CAM must be 
        subdivided to assist further discussions. One such scheme has been offered 
        by this author, dividing CAM into five categories:<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
      <ol>
        <li> 
          <p>Complementary therapies</p>
        <li> 
          <p>Scientifically unproven therapies</p>
        <li> 
          <p>Scientifically questionable therapies</p>
        <li> 
          <p>Energy medicine</p>
        <li> 
          <p>Quackery or fraud</p>
      </ol>
      <p>Therapies within each category raise different questions and issues. 
        Rather than making sweeping recommendations for all CAM, public policy 
        recommendations should vary from one category to another. For example, 
        research funding may be recommended for a promising herbal remedy, but 
        a different recommendation should be offered regarding prayer and health. 
        Medical schools may want to add information about scientifically unproven 
        remedies (like many herbal remedies) but not about life energy medicine 
        (with little evidence base, and having more in common with religious practices). 
        Some such categorization, with selective recommendations, would have made 
        the Report vastly more useful than it is with its broad definition and 
        all-encompassing recommendations.</p>
      <h2><a name="BasisforEvaluatingCAM"></a>Basis for Evaluating CAM</h2>
      <p>One of the strengths of the Report is its very clear articulation of 
        the importance of evidence-based medicine. For example, the Report states: 
        &#147;The Commission&#146;s position is that the same high standards of 
        quality, rigor, and ethics must be met in both CAM and conventional medical 
        research, research training, publication of research results in scientific 
        and medical journals, presentations at research conferences, and review 
        of products and devices.&#148; </p>
      <p>Human health and illness are complicated phenomena. When people try a 
        therapy, improvements may be due to the therapy, to some other factor 
        in their lives, to the natural course of the illness, or to the placebo 
        effect.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> The latter is a complicated set of factors that includes 
        the interaction between the healthcare professional and the patient, the 
        patient&#146;s confidence and expectations, and the power of suggestion. 
        Just because someone feels better after using a therapy or remedy does 
        not mean the intervention caused those changes.</p>
      <p>Because of these complexities, evidence-based medicine is an approach 
        to medical decision-making that relies on the highest quality objective 
        research available. Medical research studies are designed in several different 
        ways, leading to evidence of differing quality. In keeping with evidence-based 
        medicine, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine 
        (NCCAM) prioritizes the types of studies in the following order:<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup></p>
      <ol type=i>
        <li> 
          <p>Large randomized clinical trials</p>
        <li> 
          <p>Small randomized clinical trials</p>
        <li> 
          <p>Uncontrolled trials</p>
        <li> 
          <p>Observational studies</p>
        <li> 
          <p>Case studies</p>
        <li> 
          <p>Anecdotes</p>
      </ol>
      <p>Randomized controlled trials (RCT) offer the best form of evidence for 
        determining whether or not an intervention actually caused the observed 
        changes. Subjects are randomly divided into at least two groups. One group 
        receives the therapy and the other receives a placebo. The subjects in 
        both groups should not know which intervention they are receiving, and 
        neither should the researchers who are interacting with the subjects (called 
        a double-blind study). The results should be analyzed statistically to 
        ensure that the two groups were similar, that enough people were enrolled 
        in the study, and that the differences observed are significant (not just 
        due to random variation). If all these criteria are met, the differences 
        will be reported as &#145;statistically significant.&#146;</p>
      <p>Anecdotes or testimonials are the least useful reports in helping to 
        understand the cause of any changes. These are the stories and reports 
        we all hear of where someone tried a remedy and felt much better afterwards. 
        These reports have a role to play in medicine, but they do not demonstrate 
        what caused any reported improvements. Their major limitation is that 
        they do not control for the many changes that could have occurred in someone&#146;s 
        life. </p>
      <p>For example, if we feel we are getting a cold, we may cut back on activities, 
        try to get some extra sleep, and take some over-the-counter cold medications. 
        Someone may tell us they always take high doses of vitamin C when they 
        get a cold, and we decide to give it a try. If we start to feel better 
        shortly after taking the vitamin C, we as humans seem to have a psychological 
        predisposition to associate our most recent change with the improvements 
        we experience. We may then believe that vitamin C cured our cold. In reality, 
        however, we made a number of changes, any and all of which could have 
        contributed to our improvement. In addition, colds are going to go away 
        after a few days no matter what we do. Testimonials are not reliable. 
        In addition, with this example, several large RCTs have found that vitamin 
        C may improve cold symptoms by about ten percent, but it doesn&#146;t 
        cure or prevent the common cold.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup></p>
      <p>The WHCCAMP Report accepts this order of priority in weighing the evidence 
        for and against a remedy or therapy. &#147;Decisions on regulating the 
        use of and reimbursement for CAM therapies should be based on published 
        evidence of safety (including toxicity, side effects, and adverse interactions), 
        clinical efficacy, general effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit 
        analyses rather than on traditional use, anecdotal reports, consumer interest, 
        and market demand.&#148; The Report makes it clear that &#147;use and 
        interest in CAM is not an indication that these practices are effective.&#148;</p>
      <p>There is not a conventional way to evaluate medicines and an alternative 
        way to evaluate medicines. In fact, many of the central features of modern 
        medical research were developed while studying what would today be viewed 
        as CAM therapies.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> The Report is to be commended for insisting 
        on the highest quality evidence for CAM therapies. If such evidence exists 
        to support the use of a therapy, it should persuade those who may initially 
        be more skeptical of that therapy&#146;s value. If those sorts of studies 
        do not exist for a therapy for which much anecdotal evidence of effectiveness 
        exists, the first priority would be to develop high-quality evidence.</p>
      <h2><a name="ProvisionofInformation"></a>Provision of Information</h2>
      <p>Given the importance that the Report places on evidence-based medicine, 
        it then calls for the use of this approach in the provision of CAM information 
        to the public. The Report states that CAM must be shown to be safe and 
        effective before being promoted, provided, or paid for. However, too often 
        this does not happen.</p>
      <p>The Report states: &#147;To ensure public safety in the continually evolving 
        area of CAM, accurate information must be available so that people can 
        make informed choices. This includes choosing the most appropriate type 
        of practitioner, deciding what type of approach can benefit certain conditions, 
        ascertaining the ingredients in a product (such as a dietary supplement), 
        and determining whether ingredients are safe and can assist in maintaining 
        health. Yet far too often information to help make these choices is nonexistent, 
        inaccurate, or difficult to find.&#148; </p>
      <p>The Internet is increasingly being used by the public as an educational 
        tool on healthcare matters. Yet the quality and accuracy of the Internet 
        information on CAM is highly questionable. &#147;People may be making 
        life-and-death decisions based on information from the Internet that may 
        be misleading, incomplete, or inaccurate. This is particularly true in 
        the case of CAM, for which a significant amount of evidence-based material 
        is not yet available.&#148; </p>
      <p>The Commissioners state that &#147;most CAM modalities have not yet been 
        proven to be safe and effective&#148; and therefore they &#147;believe 
        that it is premature to advocate the wide implementation and reimbursement 
        of CAM modalities that are yet unproven.&#148; At this point, the Report 
        is in agreement with those who advocate an evidence-based approach to 
        CAM.</p>
      <p>However, the Report also reveals a high level of confidence that much 
        within CAM will prove to be safe and effective. &#147;Although most CAM 
        modalities have not yet been proven to be safe and effective, it is likely 
        that some of them eventually will be proven to be safe and effective, 
        whereas others will not.&#148; Having made this prediction in the Introduction, 
        and affirmed the general lack of high-quality evidence for CAM throughout 
        the Report, Chapter 7 is contradictory: &#147;A growing body of evidence 
        shows that many CAM interventions are effective in treating or helping 
        to treat a range of health conditions.&#148; </p>
      <p>These contradictory statements are the clearest examples of a level of 
        internal inconsistency regarding evidence-based medicine found throughout 
        the Report. On the one hand, the Report calls for adherence to the principles 
        on evidence-based medicine and acknowledges that much of CAM does not 
        have this level of support. On the other hand, the Report frequently speaks 
        of CAM as if it had evidence-based support and makes recommendations assuming 
        CAM does or soon will have this sort of support. The Commissioners who 
        wrote the dissenting letter point out that the Commission&#146;s recommendations 
        &#147;do not appropriately acknowledge the limitations of unproven and 
        unvalidated &#145;CAM&#146; interventions or adequately address the minimization 
        of risk.&#148; They elaborate that, &#147;While the Report acknowledges 
        that much of what is considered &#145;CAM&#146; has not been shown to 
        be safe and effective, a presumption exists that complementary and alternative 
        medicine will be found to be beneficial.&#148;</p>
      <p>The Report does claim that, &#147;Adequate evidence as to safety and 
        efficacy already exist for considering coverage of some CAM interventions.&#148; 
        But they do not elaborate on which interventions they include here, or 
        for which indications. The specific interventions they cite as having 
        been demonstrated to be safe and effective are exercise, nutrition, and 
        stress management. Yet the effectiveness of these interventions has been 
        established within conventional medicine with its on-going emphasis on 
        evidence-based research to support practices. In fact, some of the CAM 
        recommendations made within these areas (such as diets for curing cancer 
        and some fad diets) contradict the recommendations of evidence-based approaches 
        to these same interventions. This raises once again the Report&#146;s 
        overriding problem in lacking definitional clarity as to what precisely 
        constitutes CAM.</p>
      <p>Not only is there a contradictory emphasis within the Report, but the 
        principles of evidence-based medicine endorsed by the Report are not used 
        when it makes recommendations about particular CAM therapies. The Report 
        includes a chapter on wellness and health promotion. This section is plagued 
        by a lack of clarity, including the statement, &#147;Helping people achieve 
        a healthy, meaningful, and long life is the fundamental purpose of all 
        health care systems.&#148; Such broad goals for any healthcare system 
        would generate huge problems. How is the healthcare system supposed to 
        help people achieve a meaningful life? Who will define what makes life 
        meaningful? This brings healthcare into the realm of promoting philosophical 
        or religious teachings that encourage a person to find meaning in life. 
        This aspect of the Report will be further explored later in the section 
        on spirituality.</p>
      <p>Returning to issues related to the use of evidence, the Report states 
        that, &#147;CAM practices such as acupuncture, biofeedback, yoga, massage, 
        and tai chi, as well as certain nutritional and stress reduction practices, 
        may be useful in contributing to the achievement of the nation&#146;s 
        health goals and objectives.&#148; </p>
      <p>The Report then recommends that various programs be piloted to examine 
        the benefits of CAM in schools, workplaces, and federal programs. The 
        Report proclaims with great confidence, &#147;CAM principles and practices 
        may be useful not only in preventing some of these diseases and conditions, 
        but also in enhancing recovery and preventing further illness.&#148; But 
        how the Report supports these claims does not follow the evidence-based 
        principles the Report itself endorses.</p>
      <p>For example, the Report simply states that, &#147;A significant portion 
        of the adult population takes supplements and herbs to maintain health.&#148; 
        This claim was not balanced against the Report&#146;s earlier statement 
        that popular use does not support effectiveness or safety. </p>
      <p>The Report then selected one or two studies with positive results for 
        the use of a particular CAM intervention. Listing one positive study after 
        another (for different interventions) gives the impression of a significant 
        body of evidence supporting CAM. However, selectively picking and listing 
        positive studies is not in keeping with evidence-based medicine. One or 
        two positive studies can be found for almost any intervention. What is 
        needed is a systematic review of the literature to get an objective overview 
        of the research findings. For example, yoga was mentioned as an intervention 
        that might contribute to people&#146;s health through reducing stress 
        levels. The Report stated, &#147;Studies have shown that stress reduction 
        techniques such as yoga and meditation are beneficial.&#148; While that 
        may be true, other studies do not support this conclusion. A controlled 
        study found that yoga was no more effective in reducing stress than sitting 
        and relaxing as measured by blood pressure levels.<sup>7</sup> Such selective 
        use of the literature is inappropriate, although a common problem in reviews 
        of CAM interventions.<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> </p>
      <p>The Report also bolstered the appearance of evidence in support of CAM 
        by citing studies of questionable relevance. For example, a study on the 
        benefits of wearing seat belts was mentioned. In another place the Report 
        cited a workplace study that found reduced incidences of illness in employees 
        after the introduction of lifestyle wellness programs. The Report did 
        not describe the programs, which focused on interventions like safety 
        classes, training of supervisors, and the evaluation of smoking policies 
        and the food available in cafeterias.<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup> It is difficult to see 
        how any study of these sorts of interventions provides support for CAM. 
        This is a practical demonstration of the types of problems that arise 
        when a clear and concise definition of CAM is not used.</p>
      <p>Another example of how the Report did not abide by evidence-based principles 
        is provided by its approach to homeopathy. Although never examined in 
        any detail in the Report, numerous references were made to homeopathy 
        as a popular example of CAM. The Report mentions that homeopathy was listed 
        among the five CAM therapies most commonly believed by conventional physicians 
        to be effective. </p>
      <p>Yet no mention was made of the fact that systematic reviews consistently 
        find that evidence for the effectiveness of homeopathy is, at best, very 
        weak. The most recent review was carried out by the British National Health 
        Service (NHS) Centre for Reviews and Dissemination.<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup> Homeopathy 
        remains very popular in Britain, in part because of its use by the Royal 
        Family, and can be paid for by the NHS. The NHS review noted than many 
        of the 200-plus studies of homeopathy, and some earlier systematic reviews, 
        were very poorly designed and carried out. The review concluded that there 
        is insufficient evidence to recommend homeopathy as a treatment for any 
        specific condition.</p>
      <p>No indication of this situation is given in the WHCCAMP Report when it 
        includes homeopathy along with all other CAM modalities. Some sort of 
        differentiation of specific CAM therapies would have been expected in 
        the Report, such as the categorization system suggested earlier.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> 
        Without this, the Report&#146;s many calls for further funding and research 
        of CAM would be assumed to include examination of homeopathy. Yet here 
        is one CAM intervention that has been repeatedly studied and a consensus 
        within evidence-based medicine holds that homeopathy fails the established 
        criteria by which a therapy is viewed as an effective intervention. </p>
      <p>That being the case, homeopathy should be placed very low on the priority 
        list of interventions to be promoted or funded. One of the principles 
        of evidence-based medicine is that when a therapy is demonstrated to be 
        ineffective or unsafe, practitioners will adjust their practice in accordance 
        with that evidence. This example raises serious questions about how willing 
        proponents would be to implement the findings of evidence-based medicine 
        when it doesn&#146;t support a therapy&#146;s effectiveness or safety. 
      </p>
      <h2><a name="ResearchPriorities"></a>Research Priorities</h2>
      <p>The problem with lack of definitional clarity in the Report has been 
        mentioned several times. A place where this limitation becomes glaringly 
        obvious is regarding the priorities that must be set by public policy 
        in addressing CAM. In spite of admitting that much within CAM is unproven, 
        either in effectiveness or safety, the Report calls for significant investments 
        in CAM research. </p>
      <p>However, research funds are limited. When agencies make decisions about 
        which proposals to fund, they need to abide by fair guidelines. Proposals 
        for CAM therapies must be evaluated against all other proposals and funding 
        distributed on merit, not ideology. As the two Commissioners wrote in 
        the dissenting letter, &#147;Asking for more research money to investigate 
        an approach, practice or product simply because it is &#145;CAM&#146; 
        is an ideological, not evidence-based approach to science.&#148; Once 
        again, the Report fails to uphold the very principles it calls on others 
        to implement regarding CAM.</p>
      <p>Funding agencies need guidelines by which they can decide which proposals 
        to fund, and this Report provided no help in developing these guidelines. 
        The Report made recommendations for a huge amount of research, but they 
        neither explained why CAM therapies should be pursued in preference to 
        conventional therapies, nor which CAM therapies should be prioritized 
        for research.</p>
      <p>One such guideline would be to begin with a thorough review of previously 
        conducted research. An example of the importance of this was already given 
        with homeopathy. The fact that so much evidence exists that homeopathy 
        is no more effective than placebo must be used to give homeopathy a lower 
        research priority than some other therapy with promising preliminary research 
        results.</p>
      <p>A second criterion by which research priorities could be set is by evaluating 
        the plausibility of the therapy against well-known scientific observations. 
        For example, the NHS homeopathy review points out that &#147;given the 
        absence of a plausible mechanism of action, it has been argued that the 
        existing evidence base represents little more than a series of placebo 
        versus placebo trials.&#148;<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup> </p>
      <p>In the categorization scheme suggested earlier, the scientifically implausible 
        basis for homeopathy would move it into the scientifically questionable 
        category, not the unproven one. If a CAM therapy has little evidence of 
        effectiveness, and is based on scientifically questionable principles 
        that contradict well-established scientific principles, that proposal 
        should receive a low priority.</p>
      <p>In spite of a central aspect of the Commission&#146;s mission being to 
        lead coordination of CAM research, the Report provided no guidance here, 
        other than a general call to fund CAM. </p>
      <h2><a name="EducationalPriorities"></a>Educational Priorities</h2>
      <p>The Report&#146;s recommendations on CAM education are similarly given 
        without guidelines for selection. No priorities are established for choosing 
        the CAM therapies to be taught in conventional medical schools, included 
        in medical conferences or written about in journals. The medical school 
        curriculum is already over-flowing. Physicians have so much to learn, 
        priorities must be established that facilitate selection of curricular 
        material. </p>
      <p>The Report calls for the inclusion of CAM practitioners on medical faculties 
        and in medical conferences, journals, and review boards. However, this 
        should only happen after the CAM practices and practitioners have shown 
        themselves to be qualified by evidence-based guidelines. The Report gives 
        little guidance on how CAM practitioners should be chosen and validated. 
        As with research and the therapies themselves, there is an assumption 
        that CAM practitioners should be included within conventional medical 
        schools without assistance in determining whom to include.</p>
      <p>The Report does address an existing problem in the teaching of CAM in 
        conventional medicine. Referring to CAM courses in conventional medical 
        schools, it notes that, &#147;While many CAM courses are taught from either 
        an advocacy or neutral view, all CAM courses should be taught critically.&#148; 
        This tendency is apparent throughout CAM, and is even evident in the Report 
        itself. This is one reason why the Commission itself should have been 
        composed of a broad spectrum of medical practitioners, not just those 
        who were primarily proponents of CAM. </p>
      <p>The Report sets out excellent general criteria by which CAM should be 
        taught: &#147;CAM taught in the context of conventional medical education 
        should be evidence-based.&#148; Given the Report&#146;s own admission 
        that very little in CAM rises to this standard, medical schools would 
        seem justified in not spending large amounts of time or resources on CAM. 
        Yet the Report calls for significant investment in the teaching of CAM 
        in conventional medical schools and to physicians in continuing education. 
      </p>
      <p>At the same time, the Report calls for the inclusion of conventional 
        medical training within the training programs of CAM practitioners. The 
        Report&#146;s hope seems to be that CAM practitioners will become primary 
        care providers in a future healthcare system. However, given the completely 
        different nature of the training of physicians and even other conventional 
        healthcare professionals, it seems irresponsible to add some coursework 
        to a CAM practitioner&#146;s training and hope to turn out adequately 
        trained primary care providers. As the dissenting letter from two of the 
        Commissioners states, &#147;Efforts to equate their [CAM practitioners] 
        degree of training, or the scientific basis of their practice, with that 
        of the designated primary care specialties puts the public at risk of 
        receiving unvalidated and non-evidence based primary care.&#148;</p>
      <h2><a name="InclusionofSpiritualitywithinCAM"></a>Inclusion of Spirituality 
        within CAM</h2>
      <p>One of the distinctive characteristics of CAM that the Report identifies 
        is concern for spirituality. The inclusion of one&#146;s worldview as 
        a form of CAM represents a significant broadening of the scope of medicine. 
        This aspect of the Report is of great concern to an organization like 
        the Christian Medical Association. Many people have entered the healthcare 
        profession because of religious and spiritual beliefs about the importance 
        of helping other people. Religion and spirituality strongly influence 
        a person&#146;s worldview and lifestyle. Decisions based on religious 
        and spiritual beliefs therefore influence a person&#146;s health. </p>
      <p>Acknowledging the importance of religion and spirituality for health 
        and healing is one thing. Viewing spirituality as part of CAM is something 
        else. The dissenting letter from two of the Commissioners disagrees with 
        the designation of spirituality as CAM. &#147;When spirituality is so 
        designated, &#145;CAM&#146; prevalence grows dramatically. The truth is 
        that spirituality transcends any arbitrary designation of conventional 
        and non-conventional medicine and cannot be claimed by any particular 
        group.&#148; </p>
      <p>Medicine and religion have been intertwined throughout history. Modern 
        medicine is unique in being a secular enterprise. It has sometimes made 
        itself excessively &#145;secular&#146; by refusing to even acknowledge 
        spirituality. But the existence of hospital chaplains is one reminder 
        that conventional medicine does see a place for spirituality. Conventional 
        medicine has not usually provided spiritual care. Physicians and caregivers 
        should see the importance of recognizing patients&#146; spiritual needs 
        and ensure that, if they are not trained or experienced in providing spiritual 
        care, these needs are addressed by someone qualified to do so.</p>
      <p>Many within CAM seek to reintroduce spirituality into modern healthcare. 
        The inclusion of spiritual teaching along with CAM therapies is commonly 
        viewed as important to address a person&#146;s holistic needs. However, 
        this raises a number of ethical problems that are rarely addressed by 
        CAM practitioners, and are not discussed in the WHCCAMP Report.</p>
      <p>The Report describes spirituality relatively infrequently, and primarily 
        raises it in the chapter on wellness. However, as with other crucial aspects 
        of the Report, the term is not defined. This would have been especially 
        important given the deeply personal nature of a person&#146;s spirituality 
        and how it frequently borders on one&#146;s religious beliefs.</p>
      <p>An example of how this is relevant is with the concerns that some raise 
        about whether certain CAM therapies are of potentially harmful spiritual 
        origins or are covertly religious. If so, they raise serious concerns 
        about how they ought to be offered to patients, and whether or not federal 
        funding of some of these practices might interfere with the principles 
        of separation of church and state.</p>
      <p>The Report gives examples of several CAM wellness programs that it would 
        welcome seeing in hospitals, community centers, public schools, and workplaces. 
        The Report selects positive studies of several stress-reducing therapies 
        and wellness promoting therapies such as yoga, tai chi, and meditation. 
        Yet the Report makes no mention of the spiritual conflicts that some people 
        have with these therapies. </p>
      <p>For example, yoga is described as being able to contribute to the general 
        health of the nation, and children using yoga are said to have increased 
        concentration, reduced impulsive behavior, and increased self-esteem.<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup> 
        Yet no mention is made of the controversy surrounding the spiritual roots 
        of yoga, a term that literally means &#147;union.&#148;<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> &#147;Yoga 
        practices yoke&#151;or unite&#151;the self to God. . . Yoga is a means 
        towards realizing God, a spiritual, mystical path toward higher consciousness.&#148;<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup> 
        Although the spiritual roots of yoga are often ignored in America, Hindu 
        practitioners claim this strips yoga of its true value. <i>Yoga Journal</i>, 
        a popular publication for yoga enthusiasts, recently devoted its cover 
        story to the question of whether or not yoga is religious.<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup> 
        The journal acknowledged that in the eyes of many devout Christians, Jews, 
        and Muslims, yoga would be offensive and incompatible with their religious 
        beliefs. </p>
      <p>Whatever one&#146;s perspective on this issue, this sort of controversy 
        should be acknowledged and discussed in a public policy document such 
        as the WHCCAMP Report. The Report&#146;s endorsement of these types of 
        therapies carries with it an obligation to consider the potential conflicts 
        that these therapies generate. </p>
      <p>The Report similarly suggested that meditation should be considered a 
        legitimate option within CAM. Yet the Report does not define what it means 
        by meditation, which can be anything from resting one&#146;s eyes to transporting 
        oneself into a spiritual plane to contact spiritual beings.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> 
        A Federal Court ruling on Transcendental Meditation is directly applicable 
        here, and has been used to establish that an employer cannot require employees 
        to practice or attend programs they deem religious in nature. The practices 
        listed include meditation, yoga, guided visualization, self-hypnosis, 
        therapeutic touch, biofeedback, walking on fire, and inducing altered 
        states of consciousness.<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup> Many of these are now viewed as 
        forms of CAM. Although proponents of these CAM therapies may claim they 
        are not religious, the Federal Court decision on Transcendental Meditation 
        ruled that, &#147;the subjective characterizations by individuals of teachings 
        as religious or not religious in their systems of categorization cannot 
        be determinative of whether or not the teachings are religious within 
        the meaning of the first amendment.&#148;<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup> For these reasons, 
        careful deliberation is needed on the ethics and legality of introducing 
        religious or spiritually-based CAM into schools, places of employment, 
        and public health facilities. The Report did not acknowledge the need 
        for such deliberations, which were mentioned in the two Commissioners&#146; 
        dissenting letter.</p>
      <p>More generally, the view that spirituality is a therapy of any sort is 
        offensive to some people. It promotes a view of spirituality as a means 
        towards an end, usually good health or a longer life. However, many spiritual 
        and religious traditions view spirituality as an important end in itself. 
        For them, inclusion of spirituality as a CAM therapy distorts the very 
        essence of what spirituality or religion is all about.</p>
      <p>Concerns have also been raised about whether it is appropriate for medicine 
        to include the provision of spiritual care.<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup> Claims are made 
        that healthcare professionals do not have the training in spiritual care. 
        Some claim spirituality should be viewed like a person&#146;s marital 
        or financial status: these have health implications, but should not be 
        regarded as within the proper domain of medicine. </p>
      <p>The relationship between physician and patient is not one in which both 
        are on equal footing. The patient is often weak and vulnerable, and in 
        many ways wants to do what the physician desires. Religious and spiritual 
        topics must be raised with great care. Those in positions of power must 
        be concerned not to pressure those who are vulnerable into accepting their 
        beliefs and personal practices. On the other hand, these concerns should 
        not lead healthcare professionals to ignore or dismiss spiritual concerns.</p>
      <p>Besides, there is significant evidence-based literature documenting the 
        health benefits of addressing spiritual issues.<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup> Other studies 
        show that patients want their primary care physicians to discuss spiritual 
        issues with them. What is needed is adequate training so that spiritual 
        care can be given ethically and effectively.</p>
      <p>Therefore, guidelines are needed to help healthcare professionals raise 
        and respond to spiritual issues in ethically appropriate and sensitive 
        ways. Informed consent is central to good medicine, and should apply here 
        too. Patients should be asked for their permission to address spiritual 
        issues. They should be told of the spiritual basis of any practices or 
        guidance being offered. Those offering spiritual practices, or suggesting 
        that certain spiritual beliefs are beneficial, should be knowledgeable 
        of the evidence supporting those claims. Further, careful dialogue is 
        needed on how spirituality can and should be incorporated into modern 
        healthcare.</p>
      <p>A spiritual or religious practice should not be introduced to patients 
        as if it was just another therapy or remedy. People have reported finding 
        out about the spiritual roots of a CAM therapy long after it had been 
        provided. Such covert promotion of spirituality must be addressed. The 
        WHCCAMP Report missed an opportunity to encourage this discussion by simply 
        viewing spirituality as another CAM therapy.</p>
      <h2><a name="IssuesofJustice"></a>Issues of Justice</h2>
      <p>The Report claims that CAM might effectively address inequities currently 
        within the US healthcare system. Some people do not have access to conventional 
        medicine, and some do not have access to CAM. The Report hopes that CAM: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <p>may provide benefits to vulnerable populations who do not have adequate 
            access to conventional medicine,</p>
        <li> 
          <p>may lower healthcare costs and thereby improve access to conventional 
            medicine, and</p>
        <li> 
          <p>help solve problems of equity and quality.</p>
      </ul>
      <p>The Report gives little support for its optimism </p>
      <p>in these areas. Given the complexity of the healthcare system, and the 
        reasons for its current inequalities, adding the provision of CAM would 
        seem to be an unlikely solution. Yet the Report states, &#147;While it 
        is too early to judge the effectiveness of CAM in addressing their health 
        care needs, CAM nonetheless offers the possibility of a new paradigm of 
        integrated health care that could affect the affordability, accessibility, 
        and delivery of health care services for millions of Americans.&#148;</p>
      <p>Given the lack of information on CAM&#146;s effectiveness and safety, 
        such sweeping optimism seems unwarranted. The first priority should be 
        to help poor and vulnerable populations gain access to what has already 
        been demonstrated to be safe and effective. The Report&#146;s suggestion 
        that providing CAM first could alleviate some problems runs the risk of 
        supporting an unjust two-tier healthcare system. For those who can afford 
        effective healthcare, conventional medicine will be provided. For those 
        who are vulnerable and poor, unproven CAM will be provided. </p>
      <p>The Report&#146;s recommendations also assume that CAM will be more cost-effective 
        than conventional medicine. This has not been demonstrated, and there 
        is some evidence that CAM can be more expensive. For example, the costs 
        of caring for acute low back pain were compared between patients who saw 
        chiropractors, primary care physicians, and orthopedic surgeons.<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup> 
        The time to recovery was essentially the same for all three forms of care. 
        The lowest mean cost per episode was provided by the primary care physicians. 
        The cost of care from chiropractors and orthopedic surgeons was about 
        the same, and much more than that from primary care providers. Clearly, 
        what is needed before any recommendations can be made about what should 
        or should not be promoted, and what might help the healthcare system, 
        is research on the effectiveness, safety, and costs of selected CAM therapies.</p>
      <h2><a name="SafetyIssues"></a>Safety Issues</h2>
      <p>The lack of information on the safety, effectiveness, and costs of CAM 
        was acknowledged throughout the Report. Statements were frequently made 
        about the importance of evidence-based practice to determine whether or 
        not specific CAM therapies were safe. But at the same time, calls were 
        repeatedly made for increased funding of CAM research, increased coverage 
        of CAM by insurance, and increased use of CAM in wellness programs. The 
        enthusiasm with which these recommendations were made suggests that public 
        safety was not given the priority it deserves. Issues of safety must be 
        addressed before widespread implementation of CAM therapies. </p>
      <p>Safety of dietary supplements was one area where the Report had several 
        helpful suggestions to improve the current situation. Given the poor quality 
        of many herbal products on the US market today, steps are urgently needed 
        in this area. However, safety must also be evaluated with all CAM therapies. 
        Meditation was mentioned as a form of therapy that might be beneficial. 
        No mention was made of the several published reports of adverse effects 
        from meditation.<sup><a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#20">20</a></sup> Among the spiritual therapies, practices 
        based on &#145;life energy&#146; or &#145;qi&#146; have been associated 
        with psychological problems.<sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup> If CAM is to promote the idea 
        of holistic health, then the possibility of &#147;holistic harm&#148; 
        must also be investigated.<sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup> </p>
      <h2><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The WHCCAMP Report strongly endorses the principles of evidence-based 
        medicine. It makes it clear that the way forward for CAM is to address 
        the important issues of effectiveness and safety. The most reliable way 
        to evaluate any therapy or remedy, whether conventional or alternative, 
        is through the research methods developed over the last century. These 
        sorts of studies allow the identification of therapies and remedies that 
        have the ability to promote human health and cure illness.</p>
      <p>While the Report endorses evidence-based medicine, it shows significant 
        weaknesses in the Commission&#146;s willingness to implement this approach. 
        Significant failings were pointed out here in the way the Report endorses 
        therapies, or at least suggests their strong likelihood for benefits. 
        Positive studies were selectively cited rather than using the results 
        of systematic reviews of the therapies. </p>
      <p>These, and other factors, gave the Report a degree of optimism regarding 
        CAM that the evidence currently does not support. The Report itself states 
        that much of CAM does not have the studies to support its effectiveness 
        or safety. Therefore, the primary recommendations of the Report should 
        have been to call for the collecting or generating of the needed evidence, 
        and implementing evidence-based practice. </p>
      <p>Given the vast array of therapies within CAM, and the limited funds available 
        for all healthcare research, the Report should have developed ways to 
        prioritize research funding. Calls for massive funding of CAM research 
        in general need to be limited and orderly. A prioritizing scheme would 
        have benefited those interested in funding the studies most likely to 
        produce patient benefit.</p>
      <p>While establishing an excellent basis upon which CAM might move forward, 
        the Report leap-frogs beyond the obvious step of collecting evidence to 
        steps that belong much further down the road. The tone of the Report is 
        one in which sweeping changes are called for, everything from adding courses 
        in CAM to medical schools, provision of CAM within federal programs, and 
        coverage of CAM by insurance programs. Such recommendations are premature 
        until a sufficient foundation of evidence-based reviews becomes available 
        on what works, what is safe, and what is affordable.</p>
      <p>The inclusion of spirituality within CAM is of particular concern. Spiritual 
        concerns are important to patients when they are ill. These questions 
        should be addressed by healthcare professionals. The forms of spirituality 
        frequently encountered within CAM are often those that claim to be non-religious. 
        This is a controversial claim to make and support. What should be acknowledged 
        is that spiritual practices have the potential to be offensive to some 
        patients, especially if they are not informed ahead of time of the spiritual 
        roots or religiousness of a practice. Therefore, patients should be told 
        clearly of the nature of any spiritual teachings that may underlie a CAM 
        therapy. The Report missed an important opportunity to address these issues 
        by failing to even acknowledge them. </p>
      <p>The Report provides a welcome endorsement of the importance of evidence-based 
        medicine in evaluations of CAM. However, the Report arrived at many of 
        its other recommendations in ways that are not supported by evidence-based 
        medicine. The Report also failed to address some of the significant issues 
        that need to be addressed before CAM should be promoted within the US 
        healthcare system.</p>

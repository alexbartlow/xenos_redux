      <h1>Chapter 3<br>
        Our New Challenge:<br>
        <i>Post</i>modernism</h1>
      <h3>Discussion Guide</h3>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Be sure group members have read the chapter. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>In this chapter we consider how postmodernism offers a response to 
          modernist assumptions. Review the chart on page 21 focusing on the middle 
          column, labeled &quot;postmodernism.&quot; </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Perhaps its best to think of postmodernism as <i>the death of truth</i>. 
          Consider the statements below, taken at random from a series of recent 
          interviews at a major university. The interviewer asked, &quot;Is there 
          such a thing as absolute truth?&quot; Students answered: </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;Truth is whatever you believe.&quot; </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;No, there is no absolute truth, and if there was, how would we 
          know what it is?&quot; </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;People who believe in absolute truth are dangerous.&quot; </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>Have you encountered comments like this from your non-Christian friends? 
        </li>
        <li>What barriers might such views create to evangelism? </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>To understand <i>why</i> people think this way, we need to understand 
          the postmodern shift in thought. A key underlying assumption of postmodernism 
          is how they conceive <b>human nature</b>. While modernists viewed people 
          as autonomous (and capable of independent rational thought), postmodernists 
          see human identity and thinking as the product of culture. Leffel states, 
          &quot;postmodernists deny we have a &quot;self&quot; that exists independent 
          of our social reality. Culture and society <i>create</i> individuals 
          as well as all their thoughts and attitudes.&quot; The following quote 
          is by Peter Berger, whose analysis is often cited by postmodernists: 
          <br>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;A thought of any kind is grounded in society . . . The individual, 
          then, derives his world view socially in very much the same way that 
          he derives his roles and his identity. In other words, his emotions 
          and his self-interpretation like his actions are predefined for him 
          by society, and so is his cognitive approach to the universe that surrounds 
          him.&quot; </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>If &quot;a thought of any kind is grounded in society,&quot; certain 
          important implications follow. These implications are widely accepted 
          in today's postmodern influenced social sciences and in popular cultural. 
          What are these implications? </li>
        <li>Leffel says, &quot;one of the main ways society shapes individuals 
          is through language.&quot; This is probably the most abstract and difficult 
          parts of the postmodern argument. Postmodernists point out that individuals 
          always interact with reality through the medium of language. All mental 
          activities, they say, are based in language. We think in words. We communicate 
          with words. People are connected to reality through the labels they 
          assign to their perceptions and ideas. These labels, or words, are arbitrary, 
          and evolve in society. The more abstract (and often more important) 
          our ideas are, the more dependent we are on words alone to provide meaning. 
          But if language is the way people relate to reality, then we must understand 
          the nature of language. </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Let's think about the components of <b>language</b> that postmodernists 
          say makes objectivity impossible: </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Semantics</i>--the meaning of words and phrases. Postmodernists 
          say that, since societies define words, and our thinking is rooted in

        <li><i>Syntax</i>--the structure or logic of language. Postmodernists 
          say that every language has a structure, or logic. Words are related 
          to each other by connective words such as &quot;if/ then,&quot; &quot;and,&quot; 
          &quot;either/or&quot; and so on. Postmodernists say that the linguistic 
          constructions for the West promote a hierarchical, &quot;either/or&quot; 
          way of thinking. The language of science, logic, and progress shape 
          the way we think. That's why we don't think <i>holistically</i> and 
          <i>inclusively</i>. Have you heard this kind of idea before? Where?

      <h5>Problems with postmodern analysis:</h5>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Postmodernists rightly critique the modernists' overconfidence in autonomous 
          human reason. However, Leffel argues that they've thrown out the baby 
          with the bath water. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>They critique the correspondence view of truth. Postmodernists hold 
          that all knowledge claims are arbitrary, and that none are ultimately 
          more objective than another because we lack <i>certainty</i>. On a practical 
          level, what's wrong with this critique? </li>
        <li>Imagine this discussion:<br>
          &quot;There is no such thing as truth&quot;<br>
          &quot;Really, is that true?&quot; <br>
          &quot;Yes it is&quot;<br>
          &quot;Well if that's true than there's at least one true thing--your 
          statement! So that means it's not true that there's no such thing as 
          truth.&quot;<br>
          &quot;But my statement is that there is no such thing as truth.&quot; 
          <br>
          &quot;Okay, but then your statement isn't true, is it?&quot;<br>
          <br>
          This conversation sounds absurd, and it is. Is the dialog between Christians 
          and postmodernists the same or different than this discussion </li>
        <li>Postmodernists say all thought and reason is shaped by language. But 
          as Leffel points out, this is inconsistent with some things we know 
          about psychological development and the development of language. Leffel 
          cites authorities who show that the mind is active and makes clear rational 
          distinctions <i>prior to the acquisition of language</i>. How do these 
          findings impact that postmodern view of linguistic cultural determinism?

      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>To understand <i>why</i> people think this way, we need to understand 
          the postmodern shift in thought. A key underlying assumption of postmodernism 
          is how they conceive <b>human nature</b>. While modernists viewed people 
          as autonomous (and capable of independent rational thought), postmodernists 
          see human identity and thinking as the product of culture. Leffel states, 
          &quot;postmodernists deny we have a &quot;self&quot; that exists independent 
          of our social reality. Culture and society <i>create</i> individuals 
          as well as all their thoughts and attitudes.&quot; The following quote 
          is by Peter Berger, whose analysis is often cited by postmodernists: 
          <br>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;A thought of any kind is grounded in society . . . The individual, 
          then, derives his world view socially in very much the same way that 
          he derives his roles and his identity. In other words, his emotions 
          and his self-interpretation like his actions are predefined for him 
          by society, and so is his cognitive approach to the universe that surrounds 
          him.&quot; </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>If &quot;a thought of any kind is grounded in society,&quot; certain 
          important implications follow. These implications are widely accepted 
          in today's postmodern influenced social sciences and in popular cultural. 
          What are these implications? </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>- Possible answers: </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>- Cultural relativism--the view that each culture has it's own truths 
          that are relevant to them, but not relevant to other cultures. Consequently, 
          it's inappropriate to judge the actions of other cultures. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>- Postmodern rejection of personal autonomy leads to a view of people 
          reminiscent of the modernist who contended that humans are impersonal 
          biological machines. What kind of impact might this have on areas like 
          medical ethics? </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>- Culture provides and interpretative grid on perceptions that makes 
          the modernist idea of rational objectivity impossible. When people think 
          they are being rational, they are really just living out their western 
          cultural bias. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>Leffel says, &quot;one of the main ways society shapes individuals 
          is through language.&quot; This is probably the most abstract and difficult 
          parts of the postmodern argument. Postmodernists point out that individuals 
          always interact with reality through the medium of language. All mental 
          activities, they say, are based in language. We think in words. We communicate 
          with words. People are connected to reality through the labels they 
          assign to their perceptions and ideas. These labels, or words, are arbitrary, 
          and evolve in society. The more abstract (and often more important) 
          our ideas are, the more dependent we are on words alone to provide meaning. 
          But if language is the way people relate to reality, then we must understand 
          the nature of language. </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li><i>Semantics</i>--the meaning of words and phrases. Postmodernists 
          say that, since societies define words, and our thinking is rooted in 
          language, we can't go beyond a culturally relative way of knowing. Knowledge 
          claims themselves are just a matter of cultural conditioning. Can you 
          think of any evidence that knowledge is not necessarily limited to a

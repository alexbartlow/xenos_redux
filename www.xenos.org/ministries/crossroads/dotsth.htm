      <h1>Chapter 7<br>
        The Postmodern Method:<br>
        Education</h1>
      <h3>Discussion Guide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Many Christians argue for &quot;value-free&quot; education in the 
          public schools. They say teachers should simply teach students facts 
          and leave the ethics and belief systems to parents in the home. Other 
          Christians hold that &quot;value-free&quot; education is impossible. 
          For example, forbidding cheating, requiring academic performance, etc. 
          are necessary for the educational process, but they are values/ethics. 
          What place do you think values, religious/philosophical beliefs, and 
          ethics have in public education? </li>
        <li>What are the similarities and differences between the postmodernists' 
          espousal of Afrocentric schools and Christians' espousal of Christian 
          schools? </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <ul>
        <li>Consider the following passage by a science educator and then give 
          your opinion on the questions that follow: </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;The study of science and related technology often requires students 
          to adapt to a white male culture, to an Eurocentric/androcentric world 
          view. The basic assumptions of science, as it is taught to American 
          children in textbooks, focus on male as opposed to female and on European 
          as opposed to Eastern or African or South American ways of viewing the 
          world. The axiological and epistemological beliefs of textbook science 
          are tied to a European or white male way of viewing the world. This 
          culture values competitiveness and individual achievement. Most modern 
          science instruction is based on principles of realism. This value system 
          holds that there is an ultimate truth and that humans discover this 
          truth in the natural world. The Eurocentric foundation of science focuses 
          on European (and on those of European descent) values, attitudes and 
          ways of knowing.&quot; </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>What postmodern ideas are evident in this passage? </li>
        <li>What are these female and non-European views of truth that the author 
          claims to be different than &quot;realism&quot;? Do women, men, Europeans, 
          Africans, etc., <i>as groups,</i> view truth differently? </li>
        <li>Is it true - wholly or partially - that science is merely a white, 
          European, male, worldview and therefore scientific knowledge is infected 
          with this bias? </li>
        <li>Are competitiveness and individualism in education a result of white 
          European male influence? What does the Bible say about competitiveness 
          and individualism that is relevant to schooling? </li>
        <li>How would education be different, if at all, if women and non-Europeans 
          were in control of it? Who should control the education system? </li>
        <li>To what extent is it true, if at all, that students &quot;must assimilate&quot; 
          a certain instructional model in order to be successful at school? How 
          might postmodern education change this? </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <ul>
        <li>Consider this passage, also from Barba: </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Sometimes teachers believe that culturally diverse children do not 
          excel because they come from families and communities that do not properly 
          prepare students for learning. Teachers occasionally believe that some 
          students do not care if they do well in school, and that these students 
          are not properly prepared to succeed in an academic environment and 
          are not motivated to learn. The cultural deficit model as described 
          by Sleeter and Grant (1990) assumes that schools should change learners, 
          should help them assimilate to mainstream culture, including the &quot;culture 
          of science.&quot; From this viewpoint, children need remedial work to 
          compensate for their lack of knowledge, skills, and attitudes in science 
          and mathematics. Those who advocate the use of this world view regard 
          students as being &quot;at risk&quot; when they do not share American 
          mainstream language and culture. The National Science Foundation pipeline 
          approach typifies this world view. If we just call the plumber, if we

        <p>In contrast to the deficit model, those who adhere to a multicultural 
          model see the cultural and linguistic backgrounds of diverse students 
          as being valuable educational resources. A 'multicultural approach to 
          education promotes cultural pluralism and social equality by reforming 
          the school program for all students to make it reflect diversity.' If 
          one adopts this world view, children who speak a primary language other 
          than English are considered an asset in the classroom because they have 
          constructed a knowledge of science in a different sociocultural context 
          than others in the class and thus bring added resources to the classroom. 
          Those who advocate the use of a multicultural approach to education 
          see diversity as a strength in the classroom, as a vehicle for increasing 
          the learning of all students. </p>

          that students are not deficient but rather bring a wealth of knowledge 
          of the world around them to the classroom and to their academic endeavors. 
          Second, we must allow students to bring their culture and experiences 
          to each new learning experience. We must affirm our students to assist 
          them in adding knowledge to that which they already possess.&quot; </p>

      <h3>Facilitator's Manual for Education</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Many Christians argue for &quot;value-free&quot; education in the 
          public schools. They say teachers should simply teach students facts 
          and leave the ethics and belief systems to parents in the home. Other 
          Christians hold that &quot;value-free&quot; education is impossible. 
          For example, forbidding cheating, requiring academic performance, etc. 
          are necessary for the educational process, but they are values/ethics. 
          What place do you think values, religious/philosophical beliefs, and 
          ethics have in public education? </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>- This is a very difficult issue. Certainly it is impossible to completely 
          detach values from education. When there was a Judeo-Christian consensus 
          in our culture, it was much easier to trust that the values taught in 
          public schools were for the most part biblical. As our culture becomes 
          truly post-Christian, the amount of common ground in values and ethics 
          has shrunken dramatically.Ideally, a local community could delineate 
          the values on which there is large agreement, and then agree to emphasize 
          these values in the school system. Communities that have done this have 
          been pleasantly surprised at how much consensus is possible (e.g., honesty, 
          diligence, respect for authority, etc.). Where no consensus is possible, 
          they could agree to avoid those issues in lower grades and try to give 
          a balanced treatment of the different views in higher grades. </p>

        <p>- According to postmodernists, androcentric instructional models are 
          those which focus on &quot;male&quot; or <i>individual</i> ways of knowing 
          and doing things. This includes emphasizing famous &quot;men of science&quot;

      <blockquote>

      <blockquote> 
        <p>- If there are differences between one group and another on how they 
          view truth, what is the solution? Different &quot;truths&quot; for each 
          group, or that one or both groups are wrong? </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>Is it true - wholly or partially - that science is merely a white, 
          European, male, worldview and therefore scientific knowledge is infected 
          with this bias? </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>- Detailed answers to this suspicion will be given in Chapter 11. We 
          believe science is not merely European or male, although it could be 
          applied in a biased way if scientists are careless. </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Are competitiveness and individualism in education a result of white

          and individualism that is relevant to schooling? </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>- This authority is wrong on this point. Non-western cultures are also 
          competitive. Western culture is more individualistic than other cultures 
          in general, but western women are just as individualistic as western 
          males. </p>

      <h1>Chapter 13 The Postmodern Religious Shift:<br>
        5 Case Studies</h1>
      <h3>Discussion Guide for 5 Case Studies</h3>
      <h2>Elaine Pagels</h2>
      <p>Pagels provides an excellent example of how postmodernists approach the 
        Bible. She uses many of the literary tools and concepts we studied in 
        chapter 7 to radically reshape the Christian message. 
      <ul>
        <li>How does the following passage illustrate the postmodern interest 
          in subverting the author's authority? </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;When we examine its practical effect on the Christian movement, 
          we can see, paradoxically, that the doctrine of the bodily resurrection 
          also serves an essential political function: it legitimizes the authority 
          of certain men who claim to exercise exclusive leadership over the churches.&quot; 
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>How does the following quote from <i>The Gnostic Gospels</i> provide 
          an example of the postmodern spirituality that's so popular today? </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;The resurrection, they (Gnostics) insisted, was not a unique 
          event in the past: instead, it symbolized how Christ's presence could 
          be experienced in the present. What mattered was not literal seeing, 
          but spiritual vision.&quot; </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>What postmodern concepts are contained in this statement? </li>
        <li>Can you see why this kind of radical reconstruction of Christianity 
          is so popular? </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>- Discussion leader: It's popular because it leaves the individual 
          as the source of truth. No authority outside of the self is ever needed. 
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr>
      <h3>Joseph Campbell</h3>
      <p>Campbell teaches that the underlying structure of the unconscious mind 
        is based on &quot;archetypes.&quot; These archetypes represent our connection 
        with our evolutionary past, and our connection to nature. Religious myth 
        is how we get in touch with this unconscious reality. Ultimate truths 
        about reality end up being truths about ourselves. 
      <ul>
        <li>How does the following quote from The Power of Myth explain the relationship 
          of myth to our true, unconscious self? </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;All of these wonderful poetic images of mythology are referring 
          to something in you. When your mind is simply trapped by the image out 
          there so that you never make the reference to yourself, you have misread 
          the image . . . Now you can personify God in many, many ways. Is there 
          one god? Are there many gods? Those are merely categories of thought.&quot; 
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>For Campbell, myth is metaphor. There can be no objective or rational 
          grasp of ultimate truths. That's what he means when he says, </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;The person who thinks he has found the ultimate truth is wrong. 
          There is an often-quoted verse in Sanskrit, which appears in the Chinese 
          <i>Tao-te Ching</i> [Taoist Scripture] as well: 'He who thinks he knows, 
          doesn't know. He who knows that he doesn't know, knows. For in this 
          context, to know is not to know. And not to know is to know.'&quot; 
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>What's wrong with this statement? </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>- This statement is a self contradiction. How does he know that &quot;he 
          who knows doesn't know?&quot; He's claiming a kind of knowledge that 
          he says we can't have. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>Campbell insists that the biblical authors were aware of the mythological 
          nature of their writings. They wrote, Campbell insists, &quot;as if&quot; 
          their stories were literally true. What passages of scripture directly 
          reject his view? </li>

      <h3>Feminist Spirituality</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The authors make a distinction between the legitimate concerns of 
          women in a rapidly changing culture and the ideological position taken 
          by feminists. Can you see how the legitimate concerns of women (or any 
          other definable social group) is different from a militant ideological 
          point of view? How is feminism different from the concerns of women? 
        </li>
        <li>Clearly, feminism is a type of affirmative postmodernism. The ideological 
          approach to truth is clear in all of feminist literature, especially 
          among feminist theologians. They start from the perspective of what 
          they conceive to be &quot;women's experience.&quot; Read the following 
          quotes from the chapter: </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;By women's experience as a key to hermeneutics or theory of interpretation, 
          we mean precisely that experience which arises when women become critically 
          aware of these falsifying and alienating experiences imposed upon them 
          as women by a male-dominated culture.&quot; </p>
      </blockquote>

        <p>&quot;All women live with male violence . . .&quot; </p>

          approach to reading the Bible? Why, or Why not? </li>
        <li>Read the following quote carefully. What implications do you find 
          in the statement? </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;Whatever contradicts those convictions [arising from women's 
          experience] cannot be accepted as having the authority of an authentic 
          revelation of truth. It is simply a matter of there being no turning 
          back. We can be dispossessed of our best insights, proven wrong in our 
          judgments. But as long as those insights continue to make sense to us, 
          and as long as our basic judgments seem to us incontrovertible, there 
          can be no turning back. So it is with feminist consciousness and the 
          interpretation of scripture.&quot; </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>What do you think of the feminist discussion of Genesis 2:22-24 (the 
          creation of Eve out of Adam)? Does it justify male violence against 
          women, as feminist theologians argue? </li>

        <li>Bradshaw is the high priest of the inner child movement in popular 
          psychology. Do any members of the group feel they have benefited from 
          this school? </li>
        <li>What do you think of Bradshaw's loathing for so-called &quot;patriarchy?&quot; 
          Do you see evidence that people lose their ability to direct themselves 
          because they were raised under patriarchy? </li>
        <li>If my inner child is the true me, and I am &quot;championing my inner 
          child,&quot; is this the same, or different than championing me? </li>
        <li>What do you think of entering the mindless state Bradshaw calls &quot;the 
          silence?&quot; Have you ever done this in connection with religion, 
          or have you seen others do so? </li>
        <li>The Bible teaches that meditation is good in passages like Psalms 
          1. What difference, if any, do you see between biblical meditation and 
          the sort of meditation Bradshaw advances? </li>

        <li>The authors claim, &quot;Like some even in the evangelical camp today, 
          Turner discounts the importance of truth and theology in favor of ritualistic 
          experience.&quot; Have you seen this? Do you think the contemporary 
          churches are more, or less ritualistic than the New Testament church? 
        </li>
        <li>What do you think of Turner's suggestion that ritual does not need 
          to be linked to any particular truth? Are you aware of any similarity 
          in the ritual of different religions? </li>
        <li>Could you see people from different religions coming together based 
          on ritual? </li>

      <h2>Facilitator's Guide, 5 Case Studies</h2>
      <h3>Elaine Pagels</h3>
      <p>Pagels provides an excellent example of how postmodernists approach the 
        Bible. She uses many of the literary tools and concepts we studied in 
        chapter 7 to radically reshape the Christian message. 
      <ul>
        <li>How does the following passage illustrate the postmodern interest 
          in subverting the author's authority? </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;When we examine its practical effect on the Christian movement, 
          we can see, paradoxically, that the doctrine of the bodily resurrection 
          also serves an essential political function: it legitimizes the authority 
          of certain men who claim to exercise exclusive leadership over the churches.&quot; 
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>How does the following quote from <i>The Gnostic Gospels</i> provide 
          an example of the postmodern spirituality that's so popular today? </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;The resurrection, they (Gnostics) insisted, was not a unique 
          event in the past: instead, it symbolized how Christ's presence could 
          be experienced in the present. What mattered was not literal seeing, 
          but spiritual vision.&quot; </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>What postmodern concepts are contained in this statement? </li>
        <li>Can you see why this kind of radical reconstruction of Christianity 
          is so popular? </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>- Discussion leader: It's popular because it leaves the individual 
          as the source of truth. No authority outside of the self is ever needed.

      <h3>Joseph Campbell</h3>
      <p>Campbell teaches that the underlying structure of the unconscious mind 
        is based on &quot;archetypes.&quot; These archetypes represent our connection 
        with our evolutionary past, and our connection to nature. Religious myth 
        is how we get in touch with this unconscious reality. Ultimate truths 
        about reality end up being truths about ourselves. 
      <ul>
        <li>How does the following quote from The Power of Myth explain the relationship 
          of myth to our true, unconscious self? </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;All of these wonderful poetic images of mythology are referring 
          to something in you. When your mind is simply trapped by the image out 
          there so that you never make the reference to yourself, you have misread 
          the image . . . Now you can personify God in many, many ways. Is there 
          one god? Are there many gods? Those are merely categories of thought.&quot; 
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>For Campbell, myth is metaphor. There can be no objective or rational 
          grasp of ultimate truths. That's what he means when he says, </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;The person who thinks he has found the ultimate truth is wrong. 
          There is an often-quoted verse in Sanskrit, which appears in the Chinese 
          <i>Tao-te Ching</i> [Taoist Scripture] as well: 'He who thinks he knows, 
          doesn't know. He who knows that he doesn't know, knows. For in this 
          context, to know is not to know. And not to know is to know.'&quot; 
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>What's wrong with this statement? </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>- This statement is a self contradiction. How does he know that &quot;he 
          who knows doesn't know?&quot; He's claiming a kind of knowledge that 
          he says we can't have. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>Campbell insists that the biblical authors were aware of the mythological 
          nature of their writings. They wrote, Campbell insists, &quot;as if&quot; 
          their stories were literally true. What passages of scripture directly 
          reject his view? </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>

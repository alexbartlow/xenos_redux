<meta name="DESCRIPTION" content="In this paper, Tim Clark suggests that the Psalms are a theological work, that we can in fact discern a theological center to the Psalter, and that this center has implications not only for our hermeneutic of the Psalms, but in fact for our daily lives. ">

            meditation on the Psalms, <i>Reflections on the Psalms</i>, C.S. Lewis 
            says, &quot;What must be said, however, is that the Psalms are poems, 
            and poems are intended to be sung: not doctrinal treatises, nor even 
            sermons. . . . Most emphatically the Psalms must be read as poems; 
            as lyrics, with all the licences and all the formalities, the hyperboles, 
            the emotional rather than logical connections, which are proper to 
            lyric poetry. They must be read as poems if they are to be understood....&quot; 
            (p. 2-3). And it must be said that Lewis surely has a point. Indeed, 
            he is eminently qualified to make such a judgment, for not only is 
            he a renowned writer and philosopher of Christian ideas, but he was 
            also a top-notch literary critic. Indeed, some of his work in Medieval 
            and Renaissance English literature is still considered by experts 
            in the field to be among the best criticism written.</font></td>

            hand, we would do well to stop and ask the question, what exactly 
            does it mean to &quot;read&quot; something &quot;as poems&quot;? There 
            surely are different laws of genre at work, which would necessitate 
            an appropriate hermeneutic. Yet, it could be tempting to understand 
            such a statement as implying that the Psalms are thus devoid of theological 
            and historical truth value. Indeed, I believe that often our choices 
            of how we read scripture belies just such a view; when we want to 
            learn about history, we read the Torah and the historical books of 
            the Old Testament. When we want to learn theology, we read Isaiah 
            in the OT, or the epistles in the NT. However, when we want to be 
            comforted, or motivated, or awed-in short, when we want to move from 
            the intellectual to the affective-then (and often only then) do we 
            venture into the Psalms. Our choices of when and how to teach from 
            the Psalms also seems to be directed by such an approach; we have 
            our &quot;stock Psalms&quot; which we'll teach occasionally, yet in 
            general we seldom venture into the Psalms for a teaching series. </font>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I believe that we would do well to 
              re-think our view of the Psalms. I would not go so far as to say 
              that Lewis is utterly wrong in his statement-surely different genres 
              require different ways of reading. Yet we nonetheless must be careful 
              how we apply Lewis's insight as we approach the Psalms. Surely &quot;reading 
              the Psalms as poems&quot; does not mean that they are without truth-value.<sup><a name="Ref1"></a><a href="#Note1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              On the contrary, while the Psalms may not be in the &quot;form&quot; 
              of doctrinal treatise or sermon, their content is utterly theological. 
              Indeed, Tremper Longman notes (p. 52) that the Psalms are a microcosm 
              or summary of the rest of the Old Testament. And J. Clinton McCann 
              asserts that &quot;...the Psalter is not merely a collection of 
              liturgical resources but is to be read and heard as a source of 
              <i>torah</i>, 'instruction'...&quot; (p. 18). He says that the purpose 
              of the Psalms is to teach, to instruct about the nature of God and 
              man, about relating to God, about theology (p. 19). &quot;In short, 
              the Psalter is to be read and heard as God's instruction to the 
              faithful&quot; (p. 27).<sup><a name="Ref2"></a><a href="#Note2">[2]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              In this <sup><a name="Ref3"></a><a href="#Note3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;paper, 
              then, I will suggest that the Psalms are indeed a theological work, 
              that we can in fact discern a theological center to the Psalter, 
              and that this center has implications not only for our hermeneutic 
              of the Psalms, but in fact for our daily lives. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Before we can move toward an understanding 
              of the theological nature of the Psalms, we must first consider 
              the nature of poetry. I would suggest that one barrier to reading 
              the Psalms for their theological content which is faced by the average 
              is, the problem of being intimidated by poetry.<sup><a name="Ref4"></a><a href="#Note4">[4]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              Many people believe that poetic utterances cannot really be understood, 
              that they must merely be &quot;felt&quot; or &quot;experienced.&quot; 
              To the extent that any understanding is to be gained, it must come 
              via an appointed &quot;priest&quot;-usually the high school English 
              teacher or college English professor. While I have no desire or 
              intention of trying to fully discuss how one reads poetry for understanding, 
              I do think it is important to de-mystify the process somewhat. A 
              careful reading of poetry-actually, just about any type of poetry-usually 
              will produce the same level of understanding as a careful reading 
              of a prose work. Granted, there are conventions of different types 
              of poetry which it is helpful to understand.<sup><a name="Ref5"></a><a href="#Note5">[5]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              Of course, poetry tends to use more dramatic and picturesque language, 
              but this should lend itself to greater understanding, rather than 
              less.<sup><a name="Ref6"></a><a href="#Note6">[6]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              Indeed, the happy result of such use of language typically is not 
              less understanding, but rather more. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Alexander Pope, an 18th-century British 
              poet, gives us an-appropriately poetic-description not only of this 
              phenomenon, but a good description of poetry in general. In his 
              poem &quot;An Essay on Criticism,&quot; he describes what it is 
              the poet does: </font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">True wit is Nature to advantage dressed,<br>
                What oft was thought, but ne'er so well expressed; <br>
                Something whose truth convinced at sight we find, <br>
                That gives us back the image of our mind.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In other words, the poet says things 
              that others have thought, but have not expressed so well or so fully 
              (line 298). What is more, poetry does not merely say the same thing 
              that we have been thinking, only in a different way; rather, it 
              often says things that we didn't even realize we believed.. In other 
              words, the reader sees the poet's beautiful way of expressing something, 
              and says, &quot;I have never seen this before, but I have always 
              believed it.&quot; Similarly, when we approach the Psalms, we are 
              not reading works which must be only &quot;felt&quot; or &quot;experienced.&quot; 
              Rather, we see the exact same theological and historical ideas which 
              we see throughout the rest of the Bible. Yet, they have never been 
              &quot;so well expressed&quot; as they are by the psalmists. Furthermore, 
              because of the language and descriptions used, we see, not things 
              that we have not seen before, but things that we have seen many 
              times (if we are students of the Bible), yet have never really understood. 
              In this sense, then, we should not be intimidated by the poetry 
              of the Psalms, or assume that we are not able to gain true theological 
              insight and understanding from them. Rather, we should read them 
              carefully, and fully expect to gain insight into the nature and 
              ways of God which is richer than any we've known before. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We are now prepared to examine the 
              overall context of biblical theology through which we must understand 
              the Psalms. From there we will be able to read and understand some 
              specific Psalms. We make a mistake if we attempt to interpret the 
              Psalms as independent poems, to be read and understood on their 
              own. The Psalms can be rightly understood only in context of an 
              accurate biblical theology of the rest of the Old Testament. This 
              is true both of individual psalms and the Psalter as a whole. For 
              the most part that biblical theological context would be that which 
              we see from the Torah through 2 Samuel (especially for psalms written 
              by David), but of course many also are exilic or post-exilic, and 
              therefore would be understood in that context as well. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is, unfortunately, a widely held 
              notion that there is no such thing as a single biblical theology 
              of the Old Testament. I believe that Walter C. Kaiser, in his <i>Toward 
              an Old Testament Theology</i>, has successfully argued otherwise. 
              Because I believe that the unified picture of OT theology which 
              Kaiser presents is crucial to understanding how to read the Psalms, 
              it is necessary to present a summary of his ideas. According to 
              Kaiser, the canonical center of Old Testament theology is the Promise. 
              He supports this claim by examining several periods and events throughout 
              Old Testament history and theology. The key points in the OT, according 
              the Kaiser's analysis, are the Abrahamic covenant, the Davidic covenant, 
              and the new covenant of Jeremiah 31. But we can see this theme of 
              God as the Promise-maker throughout the entire OT. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the prepatriarchal period, we can 
              see the theme of blessing immediately following the fall, in Genesis 
              3.15: &quot;And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and 
              between your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, 
              and you shall bruise him on the heel.&quot; The emphasis here, of 
              course, is on the &quot;seed&quot; of Eve; clearly God is giving 
              them reason to focus on the seed and look forward to some sort of 
              redemption through it. This if followed by the special blessing 
              of Shem in Genesis 9:26-27. Kaiser suggests that the promise here 
              is that God will dwell in the tents of Shem; i.e., &quot;He would 
              dwell with the Semitic peoples&quot; (82). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This leads into the crucial blessing 
              bestowed on Abraham in Genesis 12:1-3, which was threefold: a seed, 
              a land, and a blessing to all the nations of the earth (86). Kaiser 
              lists five distinct aspects of this promise: </font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">1. &quot;I will make you a great 
                nation.&quot;<br>
                2. &quot;I will bless you.&quot; <br>
                3. &quot;I will make your name great.&quot; <br>
                4. &quot;I will bless those who bless you.&quot; <br>
                5. &quot;I will curse those who curse you.&quot; </font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The purpose of, or result from, all 
              of these aspects lies in the great promise: &quot;So that in you 
              all the nations of the earth shall be blessed.&quot; As Kaiser emphasizes: 
              &quot;Indeed, world-wide blessing was the whole purpose of the very 
              first statement of the promise in 12:2-3&quot; (86). Of course all 
              of this was accompanied by God's word of promise to Abraham, as 
              well as to Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. Thus Kaiser is able to summarize 
              the theology of the patriarchs in this way: &quot;The theology of 
              this section was intertwined around that <i>word</i> from on high, 
              its <i>blessing</i> to a chosen seed, and the <i>assurance</i> of 
              the divine presence that guaranteed the certainty of the promised 
              heir, inheritance, and heritage or even the present success of the 
              patriarchs. It was all God's word of encouragement&quot; (98, his 
              emphasis). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the Mosaic Era, the key aspect of 
              the Promise is the setting apart of a people unto God, which can 
              be seen in Exodus 19:5-6. The people of Israel are called out by 
              God to be &quot;a kingdom of priests and a holy nation,&quot; and 
              in this sense the Law is then &quot;the moral, ceremonial, and civil 
              means of accomplishing such a high calling&quot; (p. 44). In the 
              Premonarchical Era, the key aspect of Promise lies in the inheriting 
              of the land promised in Genesis. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This brings us to another crucial point 
              in OT history, the Davidic covenant of 2 Samuel 7. This covenant 
              is especially important for the psalmists, who frequently refer 
              to it explicitly. There are four key aspects to God's promise/covenant 
              with David, the first three of which can be seen in verse 16 of 
              2 Samuel 7: &quot;And your house and your kingdom shall endure before 
              Me forever; your throne shall be established forever.&quot; First, 
              there is the promise of a &quot;House&quot;. Kaiser makes the point 
              that this is referring to the fact that David's dynasty will rule 
              forever (p. 150). It was not only a promise for the present or the 
              immediate future, but a promise that for the long term, his dynasty 
              will continue to rule: they will &quot;endure...forever.&quot; The 
              second promise is that of a &quot;Seed&quot;. This is implied in 
              the previous promise; if one from David's dynasty or line will always 
              sit upon the throne, the implication is that his seed will continue 
              from generation to generation. The third aspect of the promise is 
              the &quot;Kingdom&quot;. Once again, closely aligned with the idea 
              of David's dynasty continuing is the implication that God has conferred 
              a kingdom upon David and his descendants. A final aspect in the 
              promise can be seen in verse 14: &quot;I will be a father to him 
              and he will be a son to Me...&quot; Kaiser says that what is unique 
              here is that God will now treat David's son in the same way that 
              he has treated the patriarchs and Moses. Furthermore, &quot;in a 
              totally unique way David could now call Him 'my Father'&quot; (p. 
              152). This covenant with David is a continuation of the covenant 
              God had already made with Abraham centuries before: again, the land 
              and seed and a name are promised. Kaiser summarizes: &quot;Thus 
              the ancient plan of God would continue, only now it would involve 
              a king and a kingdom. Such a blessing would also involve the future 
              of all mankind&quot; (p. 155).<sup><a name="Ref7"></a><a href="#Note7">[7]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the Eighth Century, Kaiser places 
              special emphasis on Isaiah, and especially the &quot;magnificent 
              mini-OT theology of Isaiah 40-66 with its key personage the Servant 
              of the Lord from the seed of Abraham and David&quot; (p. 48). In 
              the Seventh Century, Kaiser addresses the &quot;New Covenant&quot; 
              of Jeremiah 31:31-34, which he calls &quot;the heart of Old Testament 
              theology&quot; (p. 231). Kaiser claims that this covenant &quot;was 
              the old Abrahamic-Davidic promise renewed and enlarged&quot; (p. 
              234). The writers of the exilic period, Ezekiel and Daniel, brought 
              into clearer focus the picture of the Good Shepherd one day reigning 
              over a reunited Israel. The books of the post-exilic times place 
              an emphasis on the ultimate triumph of God's plan in the world. 
              Thus we can see that there is indeed a unified biblical theology 
              in the OT: the Promise-Blessing of God upon the world. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In light of this unified focus of OT 
              theology, we are now at a point to consider how Psalms fits into 
              the rest of the OT. What is the central feature of the theology 
              of the Psalter, and what implications does it present for our understanding 
              of the Psalms? Longman says that the &quot;central theological concept&quot; 
              of the Psalms is &quot;God's covenant with his people&quot; (p. 
              53). He says that the psalmists &quot;speak out of the context of 
              covenant,&quot; that everything they say about God and the world 
              should be viewed in light of their covenant relationship with him. 
              This concept &quot;ties together many of the strands of the theology 
              of the Psalms&quot; (p. 57). McCann says &quot;... the central theological 
              affirmation of the Psalter is this: The Lord reigns!&quot; (p. 44). 
              In my estimation, both of them are correct, yet not fully or precisely 
              enough. I am asserting that the Psalms should be read in light of 
              the theology of the entire OT, which points toward the Promise/Blessing 
              of God. Hence, I believe that the central theme of the Psalms could 
              be summed up as this: &quot;The sovereign and loving God has entered 
              into a covenant relationship with his people.&quot; The psalmists 
              do many things: lament over their struggles, call on God to rescue 
              them, praise God, thank God, recall historical events, offer wisdom 
              for living, comment on God's kingship. Yet all of these are to be 
              understood in light of the overarching theme: &quot;The sovereign 
              and loving God has entered into a covenant relationship with his 
              people.&quot; There are some wide-ranging implications from this 
              phrase. Most significantly, we see that there exists a covenant 
              relationship between God and people. God for his part has promised 
              to bless and protect them, and in response, the people have the 
              responsibility to follow and obey. We also see that God is sovereign. 
              No matter what circumstances suggest, God is in control. Not only 
              has he entered into a covenant in which he has promised to bless 
              and protect his people, but he is in fact able to do so. Finally, 
              we see that God is loving. He cares for his people, and <i>wants</i> 
              to bless and protect them. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In order to demonstrate this theological 
              focus of the Psalms-that the sovereign and loving God has entered 
              into a covenant relationship with his people-I have chosen to examine 
              psalms which make explicit references to specific events in OT history 
              or to God's covenant. These best demonstrate the connections between 
              Psalms and the rest of the OT. But I believe that we can build on 
              this foundation as a means to understand the whole Psalter. This 
              approach is valid because God's way of working in the OT is utterly 
              historical; indeed, we should recoil from considering the Psalms 
              ahistorically. Thus, looking at individual psalms with explicit 
              ties to history is a good foundation for discerning how to historicize 
              the others, the psalms where the connections are not as clear. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Perhaps the place to begin is with 
              the psalm which best demonstrates the types of hermeneutical choices 
              being made by the psalmists, Psalm 78. What is particularly interesting 
              about this psalm is that it covers Israel's history from Jacob's 
              choosing Judah to be the ruler in Genesis 49, through their rescue 
              from the captivity of Babylon. Yet, the presentation is not chronological. 
              Note the following outline of the events discussed in the psalm:

            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Either this psalmist is a lousy historian, 
              or something else is going on here! I believe we can see here a 
              microcosm not only of what the psalmists typically are doing, but 
              in fact of what OT writers generally are doing: working thematically. 
              This writer knows that God chose David to shepherd his people more 
              than 400 years before they entered captivity. Yet he is making a 
              broader point. Even in the midst of all the trials, including going 
              into exile, the most important thing for his readers to remember 
              is that God has established an eternal covenant with David. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This type of emphasis can also be seen 
              in Psalms that at first glance appear to be &quot;merely&quot; praise 
              songs. Psalm 111 is a good example of this. Much of the psalm focuses 
              on God's qualities; and when it refers to his &quot;works&quot;, 
              it is essentially generic, without a direct tie to historical events. 
              Yet we can nonetheless see the theological key in verses 5 and 9: 
              </font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">5 He has given food to those who 
                fear Him; <i>He will remember His covenant forever</i>.<br>
                9 He has sent redemption to His people; <i>He has ordained His 
                covenant forever</i>; Holy and awesome is His name. (emphasis 
                mine) </font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">According to this psalmist, there are 
              many reasons for one to praise God. Yet the reason for his confidence 
              lies in God's covenant relationship with his people. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Several Psalms explicitly hearken back 
              to God's covenants, and call upon him to remember and uphold his 
              end of it. In Psalm 74, the psalmist is calling for God's help in 
              the midst of siege (probably from Babylon, with the mention of the 
              destruction of the temple in verse 7). In verses 1-11, we see cries 
              for help. We also see the basis for the claims on God's compassion: 
              God had &quot;purchased them from of old&quot; and had &quot;redeemed 
              them to be the tribe of his inheritance&quot; (v. 2). He then proceeds, 
              in verses 12-17, to remind himself-and, importantly, God as well-who 
              God is: The Creator of the World. Thus, not only has God made a 
              promise, but as the sovereign creator of the world, he has the power 
              to fulfill it. In verses 18-23 the psalmist calls on God to defend 
              his own name, but his trump card in the claim lies in the first 
              part of verse 20: &quot;Consider the covenant.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another psalm which takes the form 
              of a lament at God apparently not upholding his end of the covenant 
              is Psalm 89. This psalm is an interesting, and painful, one to read. 
              The psalmist begins by praising God for his love (v. 1). He proceeds 
              to summarize the Davidic covenant (vv. 2-4), recount that God is 
              the sovereign and all-powerful creator (vv. 5-18), and then give 
              a detailed presentation of the Davidic covenant (vv. 19-37). It 
              is tempting to focus on this section of the psalm (as Kaiser does) 
              for its insight into 2 Samuel 7. Yet the real focus of the psalmist 
              is not on the covenant, but on what he perceives as God's failure 
              to live up to it. For in verses 38-51, we see a venomous diatribe 
              accusing God of not fulfilling the covenant. Indeed, this is actually 
              a painful Psalm to read, both because of the emotional struggle 
              that the writer is undergoing, and the spiritual dilemma it raises. 
              There is no positive turn in this psalm (Verse 52 simply ends book 
              3). This is the psalm of a bitter and broken man. It is the struggle 
              that has faced Jews through the ages: God has made a covenant and 
              made promises, but where is he now? We're getting attacked and destroyed, 
              and he is nowhere to be seen. I believe that this psalm can be seen 
              as support for &quot;blessing theme&quot; by antithesis; the writer 
              knew it was promised, and therefore it is the &quot;theme&quot;; 
              yet the promise seems unfulfilled, so it is the antithesis.<sup><a name="Ref8"></a><a href="#Note8">[8]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While the previous psalms focused on 
              the psalmists call for God to uphold his side of the covenant, there 
              are also those which address both sides: not only God's promise, 
              but man's responsibility to respond properly as well. Psalm 37 is 
              a good example of one which presents both sides of the covenant. 
              What God has promised is introduced in verse 3 with the phrase, 
              &quot;Dwell in the land,&quot; and then is emphasized by the repetition 
              of the phrase &quot;inherit the land&quot; in verses 9, 11, 22, 
              29, 34. But note that the psalmist is presenting both sides of the 
              covenant: each time (excepting verse 22) he mentions the temporal 
              blessing of inheriting the land, he also mentions the type of obedience 
              which precedes it: </font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">v. 9: &quot;those who wait for the 
                Lord, they will inherit the land.&quot;<br>
                v. 11: &quot;the humble will inherit the land&quot;<br>
                v. 29: &quot;the righteous will inherit the land.&quot;<br>
                v. 34: &quot;wait for the Lord and keep his way, and he will exalt 
                you to inherit the land.&quot; </font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The psalmist is making a clear connection 
              between Israel's covenant obligations and God's upholding his end 
              of the covenant, specifically in the earthly blessing of inheriting 
              the land. Throughout this psalm we also see an emphasis on God's 
              sovereignty and goodness in general: he will look out for the righteous, 
              and he has enough control to determine their destiny. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another example of this type of psalm 
              is Psalm 81. In this psalm we find a general recounting of Israel's 
              history. God calls for his people to follow his law and laments 
              that they do not. In verses 8-10 we see echoes of Exodus 20 in a 
              call to obey the law, but they wouldn't listen (v. 11). Hence, God 
              gave them over to their own stubbornness (v. 12). In verses 13-16, 
              God sadly tells what he would do for them if they would follow him: 
              </font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">13 &quot;Oh that My people would 
                listen to me, that Israel would walk in My ways!<br>
                14 &quot;I would quickly subdue their enemies and turn My hand 
                against their adversaries.<br>
                15 &quot;Those who hate the LORD would pretend obedience to Him, 
                and their time {of punishment} would be forever.<br>
                16 &quot;But I would feed you with the finest of the wheat, and 
                with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.&quot; </font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We see here that the people do have 
              a responsibility to respond properly in order to receive the blessings 
              which God has promised; and it saddens God when they fail to accept 
              what he has to offer. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We will conclude our discussion of 
              specific psalms by examining two sets of companion psalms, Psalms 
              105/106 and Psalms 135/136. Psalms 105 and 106 are an interesting 
              pair of psalms. Psalm 105 recounts Israel's history from Abraham 
              through Joseph, then the exodus, and pretty much stays positive. 
              Psalm 106 then recounts history as well, but it focuses more on 
              the rebellion of the people. But the emphasis in both is on the 
              covenant God (105:8-12, 42, 45; 106:45-46). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Psalm 105 begins with a general call 
              to praise (vv. 1-7), but note that the section finishes by calling 
              our attention to the Abrahamic covenant and the fact that Israel 
              is chosen: </font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">6 O seed of Abraham, His servant, 
                O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones! </font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The psalmist then calls full attention 
              to the covenant, in verses 8-11: </font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">8 He has remembered His covenant 
                forever, the word which He commanded to a thousand generations,<br>
                9 {The} {covenant} which He made with Abraham, and His oath to 
                Isaac.<br>
                10 Then He confirmed it to Jacob for a statute, to Israel as an 
                everlasting covenant,<br>
                11 Saying, &quot;To you I will give the land of Canaan as the 
                portion of your inheritance,&quot; </font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The psalmist then switches to a recounting 
              of history, with particular emphasis on the sovereignty of God. 
              Throughout the psalm, all of the agency remains with God; it is 
              God who is in control, causing everything to happen, from the events 
              in the life of Joseph to the plagues leading up to the exodus. Note 
              just a few of the verses which indicate that it was God who was 
              in control of the situations: </font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">16 And He called for a famine upon 
                the land; He broke the whole staff of bread.<br>
                17 He sent a man before them, Joseph, {who} was sold as a slave.<br>
                24 And He caused His people to be very fruitful, and made them 
                stronger than their adversaries.<br>
                25 He turned their heart to hate His people, to deal craftily 
                with His servants.<br>
                26 He sent Moses His servant, {and} Aaron, whom He had chosen. 
                </font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Then the psalm finishes with them entering 
              the land: </font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">44 He gave them also the lands of 
                the nations, that they might take possession of {the fruit of} 
                the peoples' labor. </font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Once again, it is God who is the agent 
              of the action. But interestingly, the psalmist goes on to tell us 
              <i>why</i> they got the land: </font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">45 So that they might keep His statutes 
                and observe His laws, praise the LORD! </font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">God's blessing on them was a covenant 
              blessing. It assumed that there would be a proper response from 
              the people. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The ending of Psalm 105 is especially 
              interesting, considering that the next psalm deals with their rebellion, 
              i.e., their failure to keep the covenant. After a detailed listing 
              of the many sins of the people, the psalmist tells us that God was 
              angry, and turned them over to oppressors (vv. 40-43). Once again 
              it is important to note that not only does God keep his covenant, 
              but all of the agency belongs to God; he is sovereign. This can 
              be seen in verses 7-10: </font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">7 Our fathers in Egypt did not understand 
                your wonders; they did not remember your abundant kindnesses, 
                but rebelled by the sea, at the Red Sea.<br>
                8 Nevertheless He saved them for the sake of His name, that He 
                might make His power known.<br>
                9 Thus He rebuked the Red Sea and it dried up, and He led them 
                through the deeps, as through the wilderness.<br>
                10 So He saved them from the hand of the one who hated {them} 
                and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. </font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And again in verses 41-43: </font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">41 Then He gave them into the hand 
                of the nations, and those who hated them ruled over them.<br>
                42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were subdued under 
                their power.<br>
                43 Many times He would deliver them; they, however, were rebellious 
                in their counsel, and {so} sank down in their iniquity. </font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the end we see that God remembered 
              his covenant and had mercy on them, even to extent of making them 
              objects of compassion to oppressors: </font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">44 Nevertheless He looked upon their 
                distress when He heard their cry;<br>
                45 And He remembered His covenant for their sake, and relented 
                according to the greatness of His lovingkindness.<br>
                46 He also made them {objects} of compassion in the presence of 
                all their captors. </font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">God is both sovereign and merciful. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Psalms 135 and 136, we again see 
              companion psalms which work together to show that &quot;The sovereign 
              and loving God has entered into a covenant relationship with his 
              people.&quot; Psalm 135 reminds us of Exodus 19 and Deuteronomy 
              7; we see in verse 4: </font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">4 For the LORD has chosen Jacob for 
                himself, Israel for His own possession. </font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We are reminded in verses 8-11 of God's 
              mighty works in Egypt, and in verses 12-13 that God has fulfilled 
              his covenant by giving them the land. Yet the key to the whole psalm 
              lies in verses 5-7: </font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">5 For I know that the LORD is great 
                and that our Lord is above all gods.<br>
                6 Whatever the LORD pleases, He does, in heaven and in earth, 
                in the seas and in all deeps.<br>
                7 He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; who 
                makes lightnings for the rain, who brings forth the wind from 
                His treasuries. </font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Even as we're reminded in verse 5 of 
              the beginning of Exodus 20, we see the essential message in verse 
              6; in short, the Lord is above all gods and does whatever he pleases. 
              The sovereign covenant God is in control. Psalm 136 beautifully 
              follows up this emphasis on God's sovereignty in fulfilling his 
              covenant with an emphasis on God's love. While Psalm 136 is very 
              similar in historical content to 135, every verse contains the refrain 
              &quot;for his lovingkindness is everlasting.&quot; Indeed, this 
              is a crucial point in the Psalms: the sovereign God who has entered 
              into a covenant with his people is motivated by everlasting lovingkindness. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thus we can see how the Psalms which 
              refer to historical events or the covenants can best be understood 
              in context of the idea that &quot;The sovereign and loving God has 
              entered into a covenant relationship with his people.&quot; But 
              what about other types of Psalms? I will briefly address how this 
              type of analysis might be applicable to two other genres of the 
              Psalms, the lament and the imprecation. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">What about laments without a positive 
              turn? The reason for the complaint against God originates in the 
              fact that the psalmist knows that the sovereign and loving God has 
              entered into a covenant relationship with his people; thus his faith 
              is struggling as he tries to reconcile present circumstances with 
              what he knows should be true.<sup><a name="Ref9"></a><a href="#Note9">[9]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              From our perspective, in looking at the psalmist's situation, we 
              can see the bigger picture of what God is doing in history, and 
              therefore maintain faith that indeed God was in control. Yet on 
              the other hand, we can see that in many of the events in our own 
              lives, we are in the same predicament as the psalmist, unable from 
              our perspective to glimpse how God is working. Hence, we are able 
              to identify with the psalmist in our struggles, yet we are also 
              presented with the opportunity to rise above our circumstances by 
              at the same time identifying with what we can see to be God's sovereignty 
              in the situation. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">What about the imprecations, the calls 
              for God to enact judgment on the enemies? These psalms trouble many 
              readers, and some commentators fee lthe need to claim that they 
              are merely pre-Christian and have no place within an overall plan 
              of God. Yet I think the context I am suggesting also makes these 
              psalms understandable. Using this lens, we can understand these 
              tirades in terms of covenant. Within the covenant, we should (generally) 
              expect temporal blessings on the righteous and cursings on the wicked. 
              Thus, the call for judgment upon the wicked holds the same theological 
              and philosophical (though admittedly not emotional) status as the 
              call for blessings upon the righteous. It is simply the psalmist 
              calling on God to keep his covenant, in the way that it appears 
              to the psalmist, from his perspective, that God should do it.<sup><a name="Ref10"></a><a href="#Note10">[10]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I believe that this understanding of 
              the Psalms need not be merely an academic exercise. I think it has 
              implications and applications for our daily lives as Christians 
              as well. It was noted in the introduction that many people look 
              to the Psalms merely as a charge (or comfort) for their emotions. 
              It has been demonstrated, I trust, that the Psalms are loaded with 
              theological content. So we are brought to the point of considering 
              how this should affect our lives. What impact should these theological 
              poems have on our daily relationships with God? How can we properly 
              apply the Psalms to our daily lives? Longman states that &quot;the 
              Psalms inform our intellect, arouse our emotions, direct our wills 
              and stimulate our imaginations&quot; (p. 13). Yet many people focus 
              only on the &quot;arouse our emotions&quot; aspect, and fail to 
              realize the crucial connection with &quot;informing the intellect,&quot; 
              to use Longman's phrase. Indeed, various writers on the Psalms point 
              out that their strength lies in tapping into the whole man; that 
              is, in relating to God, it is the whole person relating, both the 
              cognitve and affective sides. Yet I believe it is important to understand 
              exactly how it is that this works. Along these lines, the Psalms 
              are often viewed as a source of personal or corporate praise and 
              worship of God. Based on our current understanding of them, what 
              should our understanding of worship be? </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I believe that this understanding of 
              the Psalms can give us insight into the nature of our relationship 
              with God, into worship, and even into our evangelistic method in 
              the postmodern world. I would suggest the following approach, which 
              I think does justice to the richness of the Psalms. While surely 
              the psalms, as poetry, are meant to impact our emotions, the way 
              that we are to be impacted is simply this: We are to experience 
              comfort, or joy, or thanksgiving, or awe at the fact that, no matter 
              what, &quot;The sovereign and loving God has entered into a covenant 
              relationship with his people.&quot; Longman makes the excellent 
              point that &quot;the Psalms give us theology written in intimate 
              relationship with God and in close touch with life&quot; (p. 53). 
              And this moves us toward the key to what we learn in the Psalms 
              about relating with God. We see men responding to God in an emotional 
              way, yet it is not raw or unbridled emotion; it is emotion that 
              ultimately responds to the truth about God in his relationship to 
              his people. In short, we see <i>real-life emotion at the footstool 
              of deep theological truth</i>. People are genuinely sad or angry 
              or happy or awestruck, because of the events of life and because 
              of God-and ultimately, they are directed and turned to the proper 
              state by the truth about God. This, I believe, is what the Psalms-that 
              most worshipful of books-have to teach us about worshipping God. 
              True worship is not fueled by emotion; true worship is fueled by 
              exciting truth. It is as we fully understand the truth about the 
              nature of God and his relationship to us that our emotions will 
              be energized into praise and worship of God. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Last year I had the privilege of hearing 
              a lecture by Ajith Fernando, a pastor from Sri Lanka. In his lecture, 
              &quot;The Urgency of the Gospel&quot;, he asserted that &quot;Our 
              challenge is to demonstrate that truth is pleasurable.&quot; He 
              said that we need &quot;to show people that truth is desirable.&quot; 
              If our approach to God is purely intellectual, we communicate an 
              incorrect conception of truth: &quot;The tragedy of dry orthodoxy 
              is that it makes truth unattractive.&quot; To that I would add that 
              the tragedy of mindless emotionalism is that it makes the attractiveness 
              of passion to be unnecessarily devoid of truth content. It is just 
              this that the Psalms do. They present Truth in a beautiful way, 
              never truth devoid of real-life emotion, and never emotion separated 
              from truth. It is possible-indeed necessary-to refuse in our Christian 
              lives and witness to allow pleasure and emotion to be separated 
              from truth. Fernando asserted that we Christians need to &quot;linger 
              with the truth, we need to meditate on the beauty of the truth.&quot; 
              It is this approach which ultimately will motivate us to get outside 
              of ourselves and focus on the needs of the unbelieving world. As 
              Fernando said, &quot;When we are filled with wonder over the truth 
              of the gospel, urgency will be our hallmark.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As &quot;worship,&quot; that is what 
              the Psalms urge us to do: be emotional about Truth. In this sense, 
              perhaps the Psalms are a key to reaching the world today-they contain 
              emotional reality that postmodern man knows he is looking for, along 
              with the Truth that he doesn't realize he needs. </font></p>

              New Testament writers would not allow for such a view. It is interesting 
              to note that of the 40 quotations from the Psalms in the epistles, 
              31 of them appear in Romans and Hebrews, the two most theological 
              books of the NT. <i>Return to <a href="#Ref1">Text</a></i></font></p>

              He uses the structure of the Psalter, with Psalm 1 first, as his 
              primary defense of this of this point. I think his structural argument 
              is tenuous, yet he nonetheless makes a good overall point. <i>Return

              Fortunately, in biblical poetry the primary convention is repetition 
              (with variations), which is fairly easy to grasp. Robert Alter presents 
              an excellent discussion of the form of biblical poetry. He would 
              not affirm the inspiration of scripture in the Evangelical sense, 
              but his literary analysis is nonetheless instructive. <i>Return

              I understand that some unfortunates have difficulty discerning when

              Kaiser presents a fascinating list showing how this Davidic covenant 
              is indeed a continuation of the Abrahamic covenant. (See p. 153 
              for full list of scriptures): 1. &quot;I will make thee a great 
              name&quot; (v. 9) 2. &quot;I will appoint a place for Israel and 
              will plan them&quot; (v. 10) 3. &quot;I will set up thy seed after 
              thee&quot; (v. 12) 4. &quot;He shall be My son&quot; (v. 14) 5. 
              &quot;I will be to thee a God and you shall be to Me for a people&quot; 
              (v. 23-24) 6. Yahweh's uniqueness (v. 22) 7. Israel's uniqueness 
              (v. 22, 23) 8. Exceptional use of &quot;Adonai Yahweh&quot; (vv. 
              18-19). Kaiser also shows that Premonarchical &quot;Deuteronomism&quot; 
              and Davidic &quot;Promise&quot; form a unity. He says that throughout 
              the DTR history we see &quot;the hopes and threats of Deuteronomy.&quot; 
              When we get to David, Kaiser sees the following connections between 
              the two eras: 1. Obligation of David to follow the Law. 2. Frequent 
              appeal by Davidic kings to Israel's election and promised land. 
              3. Constant reference to Jerusalem as place God has chosen. 4. Importance 
              of name theology. 5. Confidence that Yahweh's word would not fail. 
              6. Appearance of prophets who emphasized keeping law of God. 7. 
              Promised rest achieving measure of realization in David. <i>Return

              Later in the paper I address how an understanding of the theology 
              of the Psalms can help us come to terms with laments such as this 
              (i.e., ones without any discernible positive turn). <i>Return to

              I find this explanation more palatable than the one by C.S. Lewis, 
              who essentially says that the psalmists who curse their enemies 
              are sinning, and then tries to explain how we should respond to 
              their contemptible sin. <i>Return to <a href="#Ref10">Text</a></i>

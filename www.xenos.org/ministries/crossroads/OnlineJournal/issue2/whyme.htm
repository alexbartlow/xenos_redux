            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One of the greatest acts a person involved 
              in health care can perform is bring relief from suffering. This 
              occurs in many ways, but from a Christian perspective the greatest 
              source of comfort comes directly from God himself. In addition, 
              God uses those who have earlier experienced his comfort to help 
              those currently suffering. As the apostle Paul summarised: </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Blessed be the God and Father 
              of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort; 
              who comforts us in all our affliction so that we may be able to 
              comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which 
              we ourselves are comforted by God. (2 Corinthians 1:3-4)&quot; <sup><a name="Ref1"></a><a href="#Note1"> 
              [1]</a></sup>&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When Jesus Christ first made his ministry 
              public he announced that he had come to bring relief and comfort 
              to the poor, the captives, the blind, and the downtrodden (Luke 
              4:18). Yet what we find in our own experience, as do many others, 
              is that the very existence of suffering casts doubt on the very 
              existence of God. If he is there, some conclude, he cannot be the 
              all-loving and all-powerful God portrayed in the Bible. The tragedy 
              is that those times when we most need the comfort and reassurance 
              of a loving God can be the very times we most doubt his existence 
              and his care and concern for us. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many of the current ethical dilemmas 
              in medicine revolve around suffering. Those experiencing suffering, 
              and watching others suffer, propose ways to deal with the pain. 
              Abortion is viewed as a legitimate way to deal with 'suffering' 
              an unwanted pregnancy, or of preventing the child from having a 
              life filled with suffering. Assisted suicide and euthanasia are 
              proposed as solutions for those suffering too much. New technology 
              is often developed to help people avoid suffering. But does the 
              relief found with Viagra, for example, warrant its expense, and 
              the broader goals it requires of medicine? The lengths to which 
              society goes to avoid suffering reflects an inability to deal with 
              its very existence and to understand the redemptive role it can 
              play in life. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For those in the midst of pain, illness, 
              or grief, questions about suffering are more personal. People ask 
              things like: 'Why is such a good person in so much pain?' 'How could 
              such a healthy woman be struck down so young?' 'Where is God in 
              all of this?' 'Why me?' This article will provide an overview of 
              the many reasons given from Christian perspectives for the existence 
              of suffering. Intellectual answers, no matter how reasonable or 
              logical, may not bring relief to some in the midst of the suffering. 
              Comfort, emotional care, and being present with the person may bring 
              more relief. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, to find comfort in God and 
              his love, it is important to have seriously struggled with this 
              problem and its proposed solutions before our bodies and feelings 
              are screaming at us in pain. We need to think this issue through, 
              and decide to believe that the God of the Bible is loving and powerful, 
              in spite of the existence of suffering. Then we will be better able 
              to cling to him in the midst of our own suffering. It will then 
              be easier to accept&nbsp; in faith the comfort and endurance he 
              promises. Having dealt with the issue ourselves, we will be better 
              prepared to help others reason through this problem and find God's 
              comfort in their time of need. Having seen God work in our own pain 
              and suffering, we will be more able to bring his comfort to those 
              who need it. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The relentless nature of suffering 
              forces everyone to struggle with this issue and to seek to understand 
              why people suffer. Many great minds over the centuries have grappled 
              with this question and have come to a variety of conclusions. Before 
              accepting any of these, they must be evaluated in light of some 
              authority. For Christians, that authority is the Bible (2 Timothy 
              3:16-17). However, even this is not a simple task, and some of the 
              struggles in this area have been exaggerated by faulty interpretations 
              of passages in the Bible regarding the causes of suffering. The 
              proposed interpretations must be carefully evaluated since people's 
              pain can be worsened by false solutions to the problem of suffering.<sup><a name="Ref2"></a><a href="#Note2">[2]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              When interpreting a passage, proper attention must be paid to the 
              context of the passage, and to the overall teaching of the Bible. 
              This paper will evaluate the different explanations for suffering, 
              and their objections, and particularly how these proposals compare 
              to biblical teaching. </font></p>
            <b> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Statement of the Problem 
              </font></p>
            </b> 
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The problem of suffering is usually 
              presented in two ways, with different responses required of each. 
              First of all, there is the claim that the existence of suffering 
              (as one aspect of evil) and the existence of God are contradictory, 
              or logically incoherent. This philosophical and logical problem 
              requires an answer of the same nature. The second issue is why, 
              even if it is logically consistent, would God still allow suffering 
              to exist? What possible reasons could God have for allowing suffering? 
              After considering the logical problem, the bulk of this paper will 
              deal with the latter. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">According to most commentators (see 
              Plantinga<sup><a name="Ref3"></a><a href="#Note3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;, 
              for example), the five propositions essential to traditional theism 
              are: (a) that God exists, (b) that God is omnipotent, (c) that God 
              is omniscient, (d) that God is wholly good, and (e) that evil exists. 
              No formal contradiction exists between these, so another proposition 
              must be added which is either necessarily true, or an essential 
              part of theism. This is usually done by spelling out the meaning 
              of the terms good, evil, or omnipotent. J. L. Mackie provides one 
              example of how this is done: </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;These additional principles are 
              that good is opposed to evil, in such a way that a good thing always 
              eliminates evil as far as it can, and that there are no limits to 
              what an omnipotent thing can do. From these it follows that a good 
              omnipotent thing eliminates evil completely, and then the propositions 
              that a good omnipotent thing exists, and that evil exists, are incompatible.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref4"></a><a href="#Note4">[4]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the outset, Mackie's principles 
              appear logical, especially when today good actions are often considered 
              to be those which cause no suffering or pain to others, and bad 
              ones those which do. But, a closer examination reveals that this 
              is not always so. Sometimes the choice of an action which causes 
              suffering is judged as good if there is some greater good which 
              is then achieved. For example, a physician causing pain by giving 
              an injection is viewed as doing good if the substance injected brings 
              a greater amount of relief. Similarly, if the consequences of relieving 
              suffering would be an even greater evil, the good thing would be 
              a lack of action. For example, when children are learning to walk, 
              parents stand back from them, even though this may bring about suffering 
              when the child falls. The greater good is that the children learn 
              to walk, in spite of the suffering involved. Thus it is not necessarily 
              true that to relieve suffering is always the most loving action 
              for a person to take. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">An objector may reply that this analogy 
              with human actions fails because of human limitations. An omnipotent 
              God would be able to figure out a way to remove the suffering without 
              having to remove these greater goods. These arguments view an omnipotent 
              God as one who can do anything. But, this is not how omnipotence 
              has traditionally been defined by Christian theists. It has been 
              taken to mean that God has the ability to do anything which is not 
              self-contradictory.<sup><a name="Ref5"></a><a href="#Note5">[5]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              Thus omnipotence does not mean that God can do something like create 
              an uncreated person. In relation to suffering this means that it 
              would be impossible for God to make a world with certain types of 
              good without at the same time allowing for the possibility of some 
              types of evil. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Harold Kushner has responded to this 
              issue somewhat differently. He concluded that God cannot be omnipotent, 
              but is limited by the laws of nature and human moral freedom.<sup><a name="Ref6"></a><a href="#Note6">[6]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              While Kushner finds it more comforting to believe in a God who wants 
              to relieve suffering, but can't, this view is not compatible with 
              the biblical description of God. But for most people it is not enough 
              to just show that logically an omnipotent, loving God could allow 
              suffering to exist. The existence of suffering and evil is not merely 
              a problem of logic, but is a problem in our daily experience. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;If truth is a legitimate philosophical 
              interest, then pastors and philosophers, believers and sceptics, 
              theists and atheists all share a common problem of evil - the need 
              for insight into the mystery of human iniquity and tragedy.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref7"></a><a href="#Note7">[7]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To turn to an all-loving and omnipotent 
              God, who also allows us to suffer, requires that we truly believe 
              he has some very important reasons for allow suffering to exist. 
              There must be some greater good that would not be possible in this 
              world if God was to eradicate all suffering. Christians have made 
              a number of proposals concerning what this greater good might be.

            <b> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Theodicy </font></p>
            </b> 
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A theodicy is a justification for the 
              existence of suffering and evil. A number of theodicies have been 
              developed by theists, the most popular of which will be examined 
              here. Each theodicy does not necessarily seek to explain all suffering, 
              or claim to be better than all the others, but seeks to explain 
              certain instances of suffering. One simple answer to the problem 
              of suffering does not exist. But, when taken in combination, these 
              theodicies provide many reasons for believing that an all-loving, 
              all-powerful God does exist and that he wants to comfort people 
              and care for them in the midst of their suffering. However, Christians 
              need to evaluate each of these theodicies since they are not equally 
              consistent with the Bible. </font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">1. The Free Will Defence </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The most common theodicy is that the 
              world is a better place because it contains moral agents who are 
              free to choose between good and evil, even though this requires 
              the possibility of evil occurring. The alternative is a world with 
              agents who are not free to choose, and would therefore be more like 
              robots than humans. It is taken as generally accepted that a world 
              with only robots would be less good than one with moral agents. 
              We see this in the desire many people have to raise children instead 
              of buying robots. Children are morally free agents, and thus we 
              cannot guarantee their choices. The same action performed by a freely 
              choosing child and by a robot are regarded very differently. The 
              child's action could be seen as morally good while the robot was 
              simply performing its programmed task. Morality is not an issue 
              with a robot. Thus, in our own lives we regard the existence of 
              morally free agents as better than the existence of only robots. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To have a world where moral agents 
              love one another, there must be the freedom to choose whether or 
              not to love. If God created agents who were not free, then they 
              would love others because they had no choice in the matter. It could 
              even be argued that without freedom there could be no love. The 
              good that comes from people loving one another, and God, outweighs 
              the evil that results from people choosing not to love one another. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One objection raised to this theodicy 
              is that if God could create people who could choose either good 
              or evil, why did he not create people who would always choose good? 
              But, this situation implies one of two things. (1) God could have 
              created people who were free to choose good or evil, and then ensure 
              that they always choose good. In this situation, God would be responsible 
              for all actions, and not people, and thus we would not have morally 
              free people. (2) God could have created people who always choose 
              to do good. But this contradicts the idea of freedom, which entails 
              that when faced with a choice either the good or the evil can be 
              chosen. People who always choose good are not free to make moral 
              choices. Therefore, this objection actually creates a contradiction. 
              As C. Stephen Evans states: </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;If God creates beings who are 
              truly free, then whether they do right is at least sometimes up 
              to them and not to God.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref8"></a><a href="#Note8">[8]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A second objection is the claim that 
              God could have created people who were better able to resist temptation. 
              Thus, while having the freedom to choose good or evil, they would 
              have a greater ability to resist evil. Jesus is usually given as 
              an example of just such a person. Although he was tempted in every 
              way, he did not sin (Hebrews 4:15), and Christians are challenged 
              to be like him (Philippians 2:5). John Hick admits that there is 
              no contradiction in God making people who always choose to do good 
              'so long as we think of God's purpose for man . . . exclusively 
              in terms of man's performance in relation to his fellows.'<sup><a name="Ref9"></a><a href="#Note9">[9]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              But God's purpose also includes people entering into personal relationships 
              with him. For a relationship to exhibit the attributes of trust, 
              love, faith, obedience, etc., it must 'arise in a free being as 
              an uncompelled response to the personal qualities of others.'<sup><a name="Ref10"></a><a href="#Note10">[10]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              For this reason, each person must be able to choose whether or not 
              to be involved in a relationship with God. If it has been predetermined 
              in any way that a person must have a relationship with God, that 
              relationship would not be viewed as authentic. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A third objection raised against the 
              free will defence is that while God is justified in allowing people 
              to choose to do evil, he is not justified in allowing that evil 
              to come to pass. Instead, God could arrange a coincidental miracle 
              to counteract the intended evil. This view is espoused by Steven 
              Boer and Robert McKim, but Frank Dilley has critiqued it.<sup><a name="Ref11"></a><a href="#Note11">[11]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              Dilley raises three main objections. (1) A world governed by these 
              constraints would require such a large number of miracles to prevent 
              evil that the natural laws that we now have would need to be drastically 
              revised. The Natural Law Theodicy section later in this paper will 
              show that this type of world would not allow meaningful choices. 
              (2) If evil cannot result from our actions, then the result must 
              be good, and this would divorce outcome from intentions. This would 
              also make intending to do good meaningless. (3) If every intended 
              evil led to a counteracting miracle, the existence of God would 
              be as empirically well-proven as the existence of Europe. It would 
              then be irrational to not believe in the existence of God. But, 
              God chooses to remain somewhat hidden from humans so that they will 
              respond to him in faith, trusting that he exists and is loving (Hebrews 
              11:6). Otherwise, belief and trust in him would be forced on people 
              in order that they avoid being seen as irrational. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A fourth objection to this theodicy 
              is the assertion that humans are not morally free in the first place. 
              This view, called determinism, claims there are earlier events and 
              circumstances which combine to be the sufficient causes of every 
              apparent choice. Support for this position is usually derived from 
              the successes of modern science. Physics shows us that the universe 
              runs according to natural laws, while biology and biochemistry show 
              that the physical body does also. It is claimed that all human behaviours 
              can be explained in terms of Freudian unconscious motivations, Skinner's 
              behaviourism, and operand conditioning, or the impact of society. 
              For those areas where free will still appears to exist, it is held 
              to be just a matter of time before science will show how these areas 
              also are completely determined by pre-existing causes. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But this position is not as firmly 
              established as it may appear. Determinism can be taken as a presupposition, 
              but the evidence for it is far from conclusive.<sup><a name="Ref12"></a><a href="#Note12">[12]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              With the advent of quantum theory, and the randomness seen in subatomic 
              particles, modern physics is becoming less committed to absolute 
              determinism on the subatomic level. Chaos theory is revealing that 
              determinism may not be as valid on the macroscopic level as once 
              was thought. Human behavioural sciences have made many predictions 
              based on determinism which have not been borne out in practice. 
              But most seriously, there is a high cost to holding to determinism. 
              If reality is completely determined, the experience of free will 
              and moral responsibility must be an illusion. It can even be argued 
              that rational thinking would not be possible in a determined world 
              as even our thoughts would be simply consequences of earlier events. 
              Creativity would no longer be real. Complete determinism can be 
              rejected based on a lack of evidence, and the fact that its implications 
              lead to a discounting of much of what makes human experience unique. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Bible claims that God places a 
              high value on free will and the choices that humans make. God created 
              humankind in his own image (Genesis 1:27). The precise meaning of 
              this term has been much debated, but in its immediate context it 
              results in humans having dominion over the earth. The Hebrew term 
              translated by image refers to the statues which were left by a king 
              in those regions which were under his authority as reminders of 
              his sovereignty and character. Given this meaning, humans are to 
              serve as the representatives of God, carrying out what God would 
              want accomplished on earth, and also revealing the type of person 
              who God is. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But almost immediately, people rejected 
              doing what God wanted, and decided to do what they themselves wanted 
              (Genesis 3:6). The Fall was the source of the first human suffering. 
              But rather than destroying humanity, which would have brought into 
              question just how free human choice was, God decided to continue 
              to work through humans to further his ways. God chose Israel, freed 
              them from slavery, and gave them a land, not because of anything 
              they had done, but so that he could bless them, and thereby bless 
              all the nations (Genesis 12:1-3). If Israel had responded in gratitude 
              to God, and obeyed his Law, relief from suffering would have occurred, 
              and the world would have been drawn back to God (Deuteronomy 4:6-8; 
              7:14-15). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But Israel generally chose not to bring 
              peace and comfort to others, but became as selfish a nation as any 
              other. However, God was preparing to send someone who would be able 
              to fulfill his law (Isaiah 49:5-6), and who would bring true healing 
              (Matthew 8:17). This was Jesus Christ, whose death on the cross 
              paid the debt owed by every person for sin (Colossians 2:14), thus 
              restoring people's relationships with God and allowing the Holy 
              Spirit to dwell in each new believer. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Rather than doing nothing about suffering, 
              throughout history God has been preparing the way for true comfort 
              and healing to occur. Through the empowering of the Holy Spirit, 
              each Christian can have a powerful impact on suffering in the world. 
              This is what God wants, but he still allows each individual to decide 
              whether or not to pursue him and bring comfort to others. Some may 
              feel that he should have given up by now and taken over control 
              again, but he claims he is being patient so that more can decide 
              to have eternal comfort with him (2 Peter 3:9). By 'holy conduct 
              and godliness' Christians can even hasten the arrival of the day 
              in which God will restore justice and end all suffering (2 Peter 
              3:10-11). This is a powerful acknowledgement of the significant 
              role God offers to every Christian. God offers help and guidance 
              to anyone willing to bring comfort to others, but the responsibility 
              lies with each person to choose to do so, or to choose to increase 
              suffering in the world, either actively or passively, through neglect 
              or apathy. </font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">2. Punishment Theodicy </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Given this link between people's choices 
              and suffering, the punishment theodicy claims that suffering is 
              sent by God to punish people for their sin. This can be viewed either 
              as punishment for one's own sin, or for sin in general. The Bible 
              does teach that all human suffering ultimately stems from sin since 
              God allowed suffering to enter his creation because of the first 
              sin (Genesis 3:16-19). But this only begs the question as to why 
              God would choose that consequence as opposed to some other one not 
              involving suffering. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, the link between sin and suffering 
              is often expressed in a more individualised way. Some claim that 
              God inflicts suffering on a person as a punishment for a specific 
              sin. This is the sense in which this theodicy will be discussed 
              here. In the face of suffering, reactions of the type 'What have 
              I done to deserve this?' or 'Why is God punishing me this way?' 
              reveal this belief. This belief is also revealed when people expect 
              suffering to diminish in their lives as they mature in Christ or 
              simply become 'better' people. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This view is often claimed to be presented 
              in the Bible. The Old Testament repeatedly states that God will 
              reward those who obey his law, and punish those who do not (e.g. 
              Deuteronomy 11:26-28). But many of these rewards and punishments 
              were promised to the nation of Israel as part of the covenant which 
              they willingly entered into during a period when God's kingdom was 
              geophysical, in addition to being spiritual (Deuteronomy 5:27). 
              These punishments were given for specific actions, often after many 
              warnings, and did not have the random character of general suffering. 
              They should not be taken as the normative way God deals with all 
              people at all times. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Bible does say there are blessings 
              for those who obey God (Psalm 128). While miracles may still occur, 
              the blessings which are promised are linked predominantly to spiritual 
              health and growth (3 John 2). Yet the abundant life promised by 
              Jesus will include overall good health (John 10:10). The quality 
              of our lives as Christians should always be improving, but this 
              does not guarantee immunity from sickness or suffering. What is 
              promised is a better way to deal with those times (Philippians 4:10-13). 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If the Bible did teach that suffering 
              occurs in this life in proportion to the wickedness of people, one 
              quick look at the world would reveal the fallacy of that argument. 
              The wicked obviously do get away with many things while apparently 
              good people have to suffer their whole lives. This corresponds exactly 
              with the type of world described in the Bible. Ecclesiastes 3:16 
              notes that wickedness has replaced justice and righteousness. Psalm 
              73 makes the same observation, which briefly led the author to wonder 
              if he was keeping his heart pure in vain. The apostle Paul, in his 
              desire to follow God and do his will, lived a life filled with suffering 
              to a degree which most do not have to endure (2 Corinthians 11:23-33). 
              In fact, Christians are promised that their suffering will increase 
              simply because they are Christians (Hebrews 12:5-11). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This theodicy can also be objected 
              to if punishment without explanation is viewed as retribution, not 
              true justice. If suffering comes as punishment for particular offences 
              against God, we do not usually get an explanation for it. Much of 
              the anguish in holding to this theodicy comes from trying to figure 
              out what we did to merit this particular pain or suffering. Instead 
              of randomly inflicting punishments on us, a just, loving God would 
              explain why each punishment is being inflicted so that we can amend 
              our ways. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another objection is that if suffering 
              is punishment for sin, how have children born with congenital diseases 
              sinned? The only obvious answers were raised by Jesus' disciples 
              when they asked him this same question (John 9:2). (1) The person 
              sinned in the womb. This is discounted by Jesus, and the doctrine 
              of the age of consent (Isaiah 7:16). (2) The person sinned in some 
              earlier life, as various reincarnation doctrines hold. This doctrine 
              is opposed to biblical teaching (Hebrews 9:27). (3) Children suffer 
              for the sins of their parents. Some passages (e.g. Exodus 20:5; 
              Numbers 14:18; Psalm 79:8) refer to the iniquity of parents being 
              passed on to their descendants, which is viewed by some as support 
              for this teaching.<sup><a name="Ref13"></a><a href="#Note13">[13]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              Reichenbach mentions that other passages teach that parents' punishment 
              will not be passed on to their children (Deuteronomy 24:16; Ezekiel 
              18:20), but discounts them as being fewer in number. However, the 
              Hebrew<sup><a name="Ref14"></a><a href="#Note14">[14]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              and Greek<sup><a name="Ref15"></a><a href="#Note15">[15]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              words most commonly translated by 'iniquity' do not represent the 
              judicial punishment for sin, but the painful consequences of sin.<sup><a name="Ref16"></a><a href="#Note16">[16]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              These are manifested in the guilt which a person feels, destruction 
              of community, and separation from God (Isaiah 59:2). Jesus' reply 
              to his disciples in John 9:3 makes it clear that all suffering is 
              not a form of punishment, and offers an explanation which will be 
              considered shortly. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Two other passages in the Bible make 
              it very clear that suffering is not usually sent as punishment from 
              God. In the Book of Job, Eliphaz tried to convince Job (Job 4:7-8; 
              15:24-25) that his misfortunes were the result of his sin and that 
              if he repented all would be well. But Job denied that this was the 
              case, and was later vindicated by God (Job 42:7). In Luke 13:1-5 
              Jesus denied that the Galileans killed by Pilate and those killed 
              by the falling tower of Siloam had died because they were worse 
              sinners than those who had survived. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">All the suffering in this world cannot 
              be explained as punishment for sin. However, God has at times punished 
              people for their sin by inflicting suffering. He did it at the Tower 
              of Babel, Sodom and Gomorrah, the Flood, and a number of times to 
              the Jewish people. When disease or suffering are sent by God as 
              punishments, they are usually specifically warned of ahead of time. 
              Many wonder how God could have done such deeds to so many people, 
              but he looks at things differently. The Bible teaches that we all 
              deserve death because we have all sinned (Romans 6:23). Instead 
              of asking why God can be so cruel as to kill some people, we should 
              be asking why God can be so merciful as to withhold the death penalty 
              from many of us for so long. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Sickness may still sometimes be connected 
              to some sin, which in that case should be confessed (James 5:13-16). 
              Suffering may come as the natural consequence of sin, such as when 
              sexual immorality leads to disease or emotional pain. But sickness 
              is often completely unconnected to illness (John 9:1-3). Many godly 
              people mentioned in the New Testament got ill without any suggestion 
              it was due to sin (Acts 9:36-37; 2 Corinthians 12:7-10; Philippians 
              2:25-30; 1 Timothy 5:23). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When we suffer from pain and illness, 
              we need, in general, to look elsewhere than to God for its cause. 
              He may choose to allow it to continue for reasons that are explored 
              below. This was the essence of Jesus' response to the questions 
              in Luke 13. He told his audience that there was no particular reason 
              why those people died. However, those listening to him should examine 
              themselves and note that they deserved the same fate. In light of 
              that, they should turn to him and ask for his mercy and forgiveness. 
              God's normative way of dealing with people is not to punish them 
              with suffering every time they sin. We are told that God will punish 
              individuals for their sin, but often not until the Day of Judgement. 
              Those who appear to be getting away with evil will be punished at 
              that time (1 Thessalonians 1:6-10). This truth allows us to bear 
              with the apparently unjust distribution of suffering in the world. 
              </font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">3. Repentance Theodicy </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This theodicy introduces the first 
              of a number of possible beneficial effects of suffering. God designed 
              people to be in intimate relationship with him and empowered by 
              him for everything. But this has not been people's natural tendency 
              since the Fall. We now want to be in control of our own lives and 
              destinies, thus blind to our true needs (Jeremiah 17:5-8; Revelation 
              3:17-19). God wants to woo us back into his care (Jeremiah 31:20; 
              Matthew 23:37). But often it takes suffering and need to get us 
              to the point where we will turn to God. C. S. Lewis put it this 
              way: </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;God whispers to us in our pleasures, 
              speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pains: it is His megaphone 
              to rouse a deaf world.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref17"></a><a href="#Note17">[17]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This appears to be part of Jesus' response 
              to his disciples in John 9:3 concerning why the man was born blind. 
              He says that 'it was in order that the works of God might be made 
              manifest in him.' In John 10:38 Jesus claims that the purpose of 
              these works is that people might come to know the Father. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With Cain and Abel, God allowed the 
              righteous person to suffer an untimely death, while the evil person 
              lived on (Genesis 4:1-15). God went to great lengths to rescue Cain 
              because he was in danger of eternal death, while Abel's acceptance 
              with God was secure.<sup><a name="Ref18"></a><a href="#Note18">[18]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              God's numerous interactions with Cain revealed that he was committed 
              to helping Cain get right with him, something God wants for all 
              humans (2 Peter 3:9). God even allowed his own Son to suffer terribly 
              and die on the cross so that the greater good of many people coming 
              to know him personally became possible (John 3:16-17). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Pain and suffering can be used to show 
              us that our lives are not as they should be. They can awaken us 
              from our pursuit of material things and worldly happiness. They 
              show us that we are not really in control of our lives, no matter 
              how much we think we are. They can cause us to turn to God in repentance. 
              We may grant him the control of our lives we should have given him 
              in the first place. This pattern is often heard in the testimonies 
              of Christians. Many people have accepted Christ only after going 
              through some type of bad experience: death of a friend or family 
              member, illness, divorce, career failure, or a life-long dream being 
              put completely out of reach. It is also revealed in one of the common 
              jibes thrown out against Christianity: that it is a crutch for people 
              who can't make it themselves. In many ways this is actually true; 
              Christians have come to see that we cannot make it in this world 
              without God. </font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">4. Character Building Theodicy </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The positive effects of pain and suffering 
              do not stop with the initiation of a relationship with God. God 
              can use times of pain in our lives to mature us and deepen our relationship 
              with him. For Christians, this also includes God's discipline. Just 
              like a parent God sometimes allows his children to suffer, or even 
              does things which feel painful to his children. Always, this is 
              done for the good of the one disciplined: </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;All discipline for the moment 
              seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been 
              trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.&quot; 
              (Hebrews 12:11) </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">C. S. Lewis explains in great detail 
              how God's love for people is the type which is committed to making 
              them into the best people that they can be. This involves pointing 
              out our faults, and empowering us to change. This is, by definition, 
              going to be painful. But because of the good that comes from it, 
              God is justified in allowing this type of suffering. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;You asked for a loving God: you 
              have one. . . . not a senile benevolence that drowsily wishes you

              magistrate, nor the care of a host who feels responsible for the 
              comfort of his guests, but the consuming fire Himself, the Love 
              that made the worlds, persistent as the artist's love for his work 
              and despotic as a man's love for a dog, provident and venerable

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This explanation is also given in more 
              philosophical terms when it is claimed that many positive human

              charity, but it may also lead to indifference and even exploitation 
              of the poor. In this area alone, who is to say whether the existence 
              of poverty in the world leads to more evil or more good? Illness 
              may bring some people closer to God, but others have rejected God 
              because of sickness and disease. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While the points raised by this objection 
              are valid, they do not invalidate this theodicy. It is the necessity 
              of suffering for character development that is proposed, not the 
              necessity that good must result. The outcome is ultimately determined 
              by people's choices, which leads back to the free will theodicy. 
              Much suffering exists because of the way people treat one another. 
              God offers a way to bring good from this by changing people's characters, 
              which will lead to less suffering. In this way, God can cause all 
              things to work for good, for those who love him (Romans 8:28). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another objection to this theodicy 
              is that the characteristics said to be formed as a result of exposure 
              to suffering could be developed in other ways. For example, courage 
              and fortitude could be developed in light of a difficult or demanding 
              task like space exploration, as opposed to being developed while 
              in search for a cure for AIDS; help and co-operation could be developed 
              in training for an Olympic team event, as opposed to carrying out 
              complicated surgeries.<sup><a name="Ref21"></a><a href="#Note21">[21]</a></sup>&nbsp;

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In response, Christianity claims that 
              the problem with humans is not the characteristics they portray, 
              but their will.<sup><a name="Ref22"></a><a href="#Note22">[22]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              As a result of the Fall, humans no longer have the capacity to will 
              what they ought to will (Romans 7:14-21). This makes union with 
              God impossible, and what is needed is the repair of our wills. God 
              has left open the possibility that we can desire that he repair 
              our wills, which an omnipotent God can do. Our experience of suffering 
              is often what it takes to get us to the point of desiring this.

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is not a complete, instantaneous 
              repair. As we experience God's healing in one area of our lives 
              we are inclined to ask him to do more. The goal, then, is greater 
              conformity to the divine will which allows greater union with God 
              and leads to character traits more in accordance with those of Jesus 
              (Galatians 5:16). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The character building theodicy has

            <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">5. Demon Theodicy </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The theodicies discussed so far deal 
              with suffering which comes as a result of human choices, i.e. moral 
              evil. But there is also much suffering which cannot be directly 
              connected with the actions of humans, such as earthquakes, volcanic 
              eruptions, and many diseases. These are collectively known as natural 
              evils, and different explanations are often proposed for these. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Some evils which are often classified 
              as natural evils may actually be moral evils. For example, famine 
              may be regarded as due to a lack of action on the part of those 
              who have abundant resources. One of the oldest theodicies treats 
              all natural evil as moral evil by claiming that these are caused 
              by Satan or his demons. Since the devil is the one in control of 
              this world (1 John 5:19), he is able to use it to inflict suffering 
              on people to push them away from God. For example, Jesus states 
              that an illness he had just cured in a woman was inflicted on her 
              by Satan (Luke 13:16). Conversion of natural evil into moral evil 
              makes it susceptible to the theodicies covered earlier. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The main limitation with this argument 
              is that there is very little evidence to support, or negate, it. 
              Unlike Jesus, we humans cannot confidently declare that Satan caused 
              an instance of suffering. While we must affirm Satan's continued 
              involvement in causing suffering, the Bible gives few guidelines 
              to allow discernment of this in actual situations. Anthony Flew 
              claims that this is 'just another desperate ad hoc expedient of 
              apologetic,' to which Alvin Plantinga replies that 'to rebut the 
              charge of contradiction the theist need not hold that the hypothesis 
              in question is probable or even true. He need hold only that it 
              is not inconsistent with the proposition that God exists.'<sup><a name="Ref25"></a><a href="#Note25">[25]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As such, this claim passes the test 
              of logic. But for many people it does not provide a satisfactory 
              explanation since it removes the discussion to a realm where we 
              have little information, and in this sense makes theism a less realistic 
              view. Therefore, other explanations for natural evil have been proposed.

            <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">6. Knowledge and Experience Theodicy 
              </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One of these theodicies is that God 
              is justified in allowing natural evil because it is one of humanity's 
              principal sources of moral knowledge.<sup><a name="Ref26"></a><a href="#Note26">[26]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              Through observing predictable events in nature people learn what 
              actions cause or prevent pain, and thus what are morally bad or 
              good actions. For example, from seeing the results of a fire started 
              by a bolt of lightning we can deduce that it would be a bad thing 
              for a person to start a similar fire. In addition, through experiencing 
              the pain of natural evil, we can learn to sympathise with others 
              experiencing similar pain, and also view inflicting that type of 
              pain on others as wrong. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;If man is to have a free and 
              responsible choice of destiny, he needs to have a range of actions 
              open to him, whose consequences, good and evil, he understands, 
              and he can only have that understanding in a world which already 
              has built into it many natural processes productive of both good 
              and evil.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref27"></a><a href="#Note27">[27]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">An objection to this theodicy is that 
              God could have given this knowledge in some other way which did 
              not involve suffering. God did this in the past when he used prophets 
              (Jeremiah 42:1-16), visions (Daniel 8-10), animals (Numbers 22:21-35), 
              and inanimate objects (1 Samuel 23:9-11) to warn people of the consequences 
              of their actions. But, even when it was widely acknowledged that 
              these people brought knowledge directly from God they were rarely 
              heeded. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Personal experience appears to be a 
              better teacher than another's advice.<sup><a name="Ref28"></a><a href="#Note28">[28]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              It is important that people come to some understanding of right 
              and wrong on their own so that they develop responsibility for their 
              own decisions.<sup><a name="Ref29"></a><a href="#Note29">[29]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              If God had delineated right and wrong for every circumstance people 
              'would be so suffocated by God that they had little real choice 
              of destiny.'<sup><a name="Ref30"></a><a href="#Note30">[30]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              God's existence would become so obvious that it would be irrational 
              not to believe in him. The problem with this situation has already 
              been addressed. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This theodicy may give some helpful 
              insight into the meaning of the tree of knowledge of good and evil 
              (Genesis 2:17). Humans were tempted to become able to understand 
              good and evil, and thus disobeyed God. The consequences were that 
              humans were banished from the Garden of Eden and began to suffer 
              pain. The knowledge of good and evil would then come through the 
              pain which people would suffer. This would come from natural evil, 
              but also moral evil, which would proliferate as a result of people's 
              inherent sin nature. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">God accommodated the human desire to 
              know good and evil apart from him. But this could only be done at 
              the price of suffering. In his grace and mercy, God still instructs 
              us about good and evil through the Bible and the Holy Spirit (John 
              16:8-11; 2 Timothy 3:16-17). But even this requires we have some 
              moral concepts with which to see the goodness of God's ways. Suffering 
              teaches us enough about good and evil that we can judge that God 
              is good, and that what the Bible teaches is good. </font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">7. Natural Law Theodicy </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another explanation given for natural 
              evil is that it is a necessary product of an orderly universe governed 
              by natural law. In a world where choices are to be judged as good 
              or bad, there must be a significant amount of predictability. Based 
              on how things normally occur, a person can know with a good degree 
              of confidence what the outcome will be. Therefore, they can be held 
              accountable for the moral nature of their decisions. This can only 
              occur in a universe bound by certain laws of nature which are independent 
              of the desires of the involved parties. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So, when a boulder moves on a mountain-side 
              we know that it will roll downhill. When it hits a larger boulder, 
              it will probably be broken into smaller pieces. But, when it rolls 
              onto a road and hits a passing car, the car will probably be smashed 
              and the passengers hurt or killed, causing grief to their relatives 
              and friends and fear in other motorists. If the boulder was to stop 
              rolling simply because its path could result in suffering, or if 
              it was to cause no damage upon hitting a smaller, weaker car, we 
              would loose much of our predictive powers. This would eliminate 
              accountability and true moral choice, thus making natural evil amenable 
              to the arguments of the free will defence. Therefore, God is justified 
              in creating a world of this type and placing humans in it. However, 
              when personal beings are introduced into a world based on natural 
              law, natural evil and its accompanying suffering are inevitable 
              by-products. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Some have argued that God could have 
              made a world with different natural laws which would not have led 
              to natural evils. However, natural laws are not abstract mathematical 
              equations, but descriptions of how natural objects act and react 
              under certain conditions.<sup><a name="Ref31"></a><a href="#Note31">[31]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              To change these laws would require changing the very nature of objects. 
              For example, water would have to become something in which people 
              could not drown. That would involve changing all its related properties 
              which make it the compound we are familiar with and which make it 
              so essential for life. To change the natural laws would require 
              changing almost all objects to such an extent that they would not 
              be recognisable to us. Thus, we have no way of predicting what such 
              a world would be like, and certainly no way of being assured that 
              it would be a world with less natural evil. In this case, the burden 
              of proof is on the objector to provide a model of a universe with 
              alternative natural laws. It remains reasonable to believe that 
              God was justified in choosing the natural laws we have. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another objection raised against this 
              theodicy is that a loving God would protect his creatures from the 
              negative effects of these natural laws by suspending them whenever 
              evil was about to occur. So, for example, as the boulder continued 
              onto the road it could become elastic and bounce over an oncoming 
              car. But these types of 'miracles' would have to happen so often 
              that people 'could not entertain rational expectations, make predictions, 
              estimate probabilities, or calculate prudence.'<sup><a name="Ref32"></a><a href="#Note32">[32]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              The result would be a world 'in which wrong actions were impossible, 
              and in which, therefore, freedom of the will would be void; . . 
              . evil thoughts would be impossible, for the cerebral matter which 
              we use in thinking would refuse its task when we attempted to frame 
              them.'<sup><a name="Ref33"></a><a href="#Note33">[33]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              Therefore, moral choices would not be possible, which would not 
              be desirable for the reasons given under the Free Will Defence. 
              </font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">8. Evidential Form of the Problem 
              </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This form of the problem admits that 
              it is possible for God and evil to co-exist. This is treated as 
              a hypothesis which is tested based on the evidence available to 
              support and refute it. Many people experience God as a loving God. 
              They have read in the Bible that he is so, and believe he has acted 
              in loving ways at many points in history. This counts as strong 
              evidence for the theist.<sup><a name="Ref34"></a><a href="#Note34">[34]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              So, even though we may not be able to reconcile all the suffering 
              we see, it must be remembered that our finite minds will not be 
              able to comprehend everything. We must examine all the evidence, 
              and though we may see the existence of evil as a difficulty, we 
              can take it on faith that God is loving and has his reasons for 
              allowing suffering. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This argument has the advantage of 
              making use of all aspects of religious experience. It accepts the 
              incompleteness of each theodicy. But taken together, they constitute 
              a strong argument. It shows that there is an element of faith in 
              people's willingness, or otherwise, to accept a resolution to this 
              problem. On the other hand, it legitimises the atheist's attempt 
              to accumulate evidence and testimony contrary to the existence of 
              a loving God, and boils the solution down to a choice between two 
              arguments. </font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">9. Gratuitous Evil </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A problem with any theodicy attempting 
              to explain every form of suffering is that some suffering seems 
              to be beyond explanation. Foremost among these gratuitous evils 
              is the extreme suffering which some children go through from birth. 
              This, of all suffering, seems to have no redeeming value. This allegedly 
              weakens the case for theism in that new explanations are seen as 
              <i>ad hoc</i>. As we have seen, some theists claim that the apparent 
              gratuity of some suffering is caused by the limitations of human 
              reason, while others claim that these types of sufferings are punishments 
              for sins committed. Others claim that it will all work out in the 
              long run in heaven, so meanwhile we should just have faith. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, some commentators have noted 
              that these interpretations are not necessitated by beliefs about 
              the character of God. Rather, they are based on the assumption that 
              a loving God could not allow gratuitous evil to exist. This involves 
              denying the experience and feelings of gratuitous evil and means 
              that 'theodicy never relevantly addresses the very phenomenon it 
              purports to explicate.'<sup><a name="Ref35"></a><a href="#Note35">[35]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This assumption has been critiqued 
              in detail (for example, by Peterson). This is not just a philosophical 
              point of discussion, but has broader implications: </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;A theistic case against gratuitous 
              evil casts grave doubt on the reliability of human experience and 
              on the moral and rational categories which condition it, and thus 
              runs the risk of being self-defeating.&quot; <sup><a name="Ref36"></a><a href="#Note36">[36]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Peterson assumes that if God gives 
              people free will with the goal of accomplishing the maximum good, 
              it must also be possible they can accomplish the maximum evil, which, 
              be definition, would be gratuitous evil. Since the world needs to 
              operate according to natural laws which do not seem easily changeable, 
              the gratuitous nature of some natural evils is a consequence of 
              the natural order, and not of a specific reason for that evil. Peterson 
              claims that gratuitous evil is an essential part of God's hiddenness, 
              which, agreeing with Hick's thesis, is needed for humans to freely 
              choose whether to believe in God or not. He claims that gratuitous 
              evil is evidence <i>for</i> theism, revealing a God who places a 
              high premium on creativity and moral effort and who wants to transform 
              humans into his likeness. It reveals a God who wants to give the 
              most to his creatures. But in order that this gift can be freely 
              accepted, the environment must be a perilous one. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Theodicy does not explain each particular 
              instance of suffering, but tries to explain the kind of world we 
              have, which allows even the most gratuitous suffering to occur. 
              This view leads to a change in the role of the theodicist.<sup><a name="Ref37"></a><a href="#Note37">[37]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              Instead of seeking an explanation for each case of suffering, the 
              theodicist shows how suffering in general can be redemptive. This, 
              in itself, can bring significant hope in the midst of pain. It gives 
              someone reasons to cling faithfully to God while weathering the 
              storm. This remains an important way to relieve suffering and spread 
              the grace of God in the world. </font></p>
            <b> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Conclusion </font></p>
            </b> 
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Suffering exists, and causes problems 
              for humans in their approach to God. We cannot be confident that 
              we know why God allows each particular episode of suffering. Job 
              never found out why he was suffering (Job 42:1-6). The relentless 
              search for an explanation for each particular instance of suffering 
              can even be a cause for further suffering. False explanations can 
              cause even more pain, for example by inflicting false guilt, offering 
              false hope, or denying the reality or extent of the pain. God does 
              not promise to explain the cause of our suffering, but he does promise 
              to be with us and help us get through the pain. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Not knowing why we are suffering is 
              very different from claiming that suffering is inconsistent with 
              God's existence. It has proved to be very difficult to demonstrate 
              that God could not allow evil to exist, even gratuitous evil. Instead, 
              some very plausible arguments have been offered to explain why suffering 
              in general does exist, and why God must allow it to exist. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In focusing on the intellectual side 
              of this problem, it is important not to neglect or deny the emotional 
              side of suffering. The Psalms reveal that God is very concerned 
              about people's emotions and their healthy expression. Christianity 
              goes much further than offering rational arguments for the co-existence 
              of suffering and God. Through reflection on these arguments, a person's 
              faith in God and trust in him in the midst of suffering will be 
              strengthened. Having come to a personal conviction on this issue 
              he or she will be less likely to waver at the precise moment when 
              it is most important to cling to God. Our intellect can bring emotional 
              comfort in the midst of suffering. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Through the example of Jesus' suffering 
              we know that we have a God who can empathise with us in every way 
              (Hebrews 2:9, 18). We have a God who wants to comfort us in our 
              sufferings (2 Corinthians 1:3-11). This is accomplished directly 
              by God and the Holy Spirit, but also through other Christians. The 
              existence of suffering should motivate Christians to bring healing 
              and comfort to those who are in pain (Philippians 2:1-8). The Christian 
              also has a great source of hope in the knowledge that this suffering 
              will come to an end, and will lead to a time of true peace and happiness 
              (Romans 8:19-23). </font></p>

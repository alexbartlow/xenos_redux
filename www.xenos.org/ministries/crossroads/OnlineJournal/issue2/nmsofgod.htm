            my friends call me, &quot;Mary,&quot; they don't mean to describe 
            me as &quot;bitter&quot; although at times this may be most fitting. 
            In fact, many probably do not even know that &quot;Mary&quot; means 
            &quot;bitter.&quot; Such is typical of the etymological importance 
            that we in the modern western world place on a name. Rather than a 
            name being used or chosen to describe what someone is like, a name 
            is chosen or used so that others know what to call someone; it identifes 
            an individual with regard to family and provides a way to address 
            them. If I had a name that was descriptive in some way of my character, 
            I'm sure it would be something that means, &quot;wildly generous;&quot; 
            &quot;sacrificial,&quot; or the like! </font></td>

            goals and dreams for him. So it is true that in other cultures, a 
            name has deeper significance. The Hebrew culture was one such culture 
            during the early times of the Old Testament. In this paper, we will 
            look at the names used for God in the Old Testament. The question 
            to be considered is whether or not the name/names used for God were 
            intended to have a material effect on the theological content of the 
            scripture? Or, are they, generally speaking, arbitrary, interchangeable,

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Hebrew word which is translated, 
              &quot;name&quot; is <i>shem.</i> The etymology of this word is little 
              help in understanding the significance of a name.<sup><a name="Ref1"></a><a href="#Note1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              However, throughout the Old Testament we are given many indications 
              that personal name meant much more than a means of identification. 
              &quot;In the modern world, a person's name is merely an identifying 
              label, like a number, which could be changed without loss. Bible 
              names, however, have their background in the widespread tradition 
              that personal names give information, describing in some way who 
              people are.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref2"></a><a href="#Note2">[2]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              To explain and give one's name was to reveal the central aspect 
              of one's personality and character. Consider the following examples:

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The names that we read in our English 
              Bibles, <i>God</i> and <i>Lord</i>, reveal little to us in terms 
              of God's character, nature and personality. Much of the understanding 
              is lost in the translation, and, if we are to understand their fullness, 
              we must understand them in their original language. There are many 
              names used for God in Scripture.<sup><a name="Ref4"></a><a href="#Note4">[4]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              The great difficulty arises in the ability to describe an infinite 
              Being, in finite terms. Nathan Stone makes the point in his book, 
              <i>Names of God</i>, that one needs many words to describe the character 
              and personality of human beings like Moses and David, let alone 
              the Supreme God of the Universe! No <i>one</i> name, he suggests, 
              is sufficient to accomplish this purpose.<sup><a name="Ref5"></a><a href="#Note5">[5]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We will look at the most prevalent 
              and some of the rarer names used by the biblical authors. One thing 
              we must keep in mind is that Scripture is the revelation of God 
              to man. As such, the ultimate authority and control of these names 
              as they are used, is God's. The individual authors may have had 
              a unique purpose and contribution, or preference, but that purpose 
              must ultimately be attributed to God (2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:20,21). 
              The biblical author viewed the events he recorded as unique, historical 
              events in which a speaking and acting God revealed His will to, 
              and through mankind. &quot;These events were the initial patterns 
              for all subsequent encounters of God with men. They were not simply 
              events, but they were unique events.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref6"></a><a href="#Note6">[6]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Walter Kaiser, in his incisive work, 
              <i>Toward an Old Testament Theology</i>, has identified this unfolding 
              purpose in the Old Testament, as God's revelation of Himself as 
              the God of Promise. He argues inductively that, </font></p>

              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Such a category was sufficient to 
                encompass a great variety of biblical books, themes and concepts. 
                In spite of an almost universal chorus to the contrary, the mass 
                of data is neither intractable nor impossible. It does yield up 
                a single theology with a deliberate plan of God. Furthermore, 
                Scripture presents its own key of organization. The OT does possess 
                its own canonical inner unity which binds together the various 
                emphases and longitudinal themes. This is not a hidden inner unity. 
                It lies open and ready for all: The Promise of God.<sup><a name="Ref7"></a><a href="#Note7">[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Throughout the course of our study 
              we will seek to determine to what extent, if any, these names contribute 
              to understanding the immediate context and the broader unfolding 
              of God's purpose and plan of Promise. </font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Yahweh </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The place to start in order to understand 
              the names for God is in the powerful way that God revealed Himself 
              to Moses. In the event where God speaks to Moses in the Burning 
              Bush (Exodus 3), He identifies Himself as the God of the patriarchal 
              covenant: </font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">5 Then He said, &quot;Do not come 
                near here; remove your sandals from your feet, for the place on 
                which you are standing is holy ground.&quot; 6 He said also, &quot;I 
                am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, 
                and the God of Jacob.&quot; Then Moses hid his face, for he was 
                afraid to look at God (vs. 5,6). </font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is no small claim. The covenant 
              with Abraham (Gen. 12:1-3; 15:1-21, 17:1-14), reaffirmed with Isaac 
              (Gen. 26:23-25), and to Jacob (Gen. 28:3-19; 35:9-14), included 
              the promise of : a great name, a great nation, a blessing to all 
              the nations, an everlasting kingdom, and a land to possess forever. 
              Abraham received this promise by faith (Gen. 15:6), at which point 
              God cut the covenant with Abraham by Himself (Gen. 15:9-19). In 
              doing this He demonstrated His everlasting commitment to upholding 
              His own promise! </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As He appears in the Burning Bush, 
              God continues by expressing His concern for the nation of Israel 
              and tells Moses He has heard their &quot;cry&quot; (Ex. 3:9). Moses' 
              mission is to go and bring His people out of their oppression in 
              Egypt; this in keeping with the covenant that God has already made. 
              Moses responds: </font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">11 &quot;Who am I, that I should 
                go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the sons of Israel out 
                of Egypt?&quot; 12 And He said, &quot;Certainly I will be with 
                you, and this shall be the sign to you that it is I who have sent 
                you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall 
                worship God at this mountain.&quot; 13 Then Moses said to God, 
                &quot;Behold, I am going to the sons of Israel, and I will say 
                to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you.' Now they 
                may say to me, 'What is His name?' What shall I say to them?&quot; 
                14 God said to Moses, &quot;I AM WHO I AM&quot;; and He said, 
                &quot;Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'I AM has sent 
                me to you.'&quot; 15 God, furthermore, said to Moses, &quot;Thus 
                you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'The LORD (Yahweh), the God 
                of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">God is placing incomparable significance 
              on His own name. He identifies Himself as <i>Yhvh</i>, or <i>Yahweh 
              </i>which becomes the proper name of the God of Israel. It is used 
              6824 times in the Old Testament as God's name.<sup><a name="Ref8"></a><a href="#Note8">[8]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              Little can be determined as to the meaning of this name from the

              sovereign reality in an everlasting covenant relationship with Israel. 
              This was the starting point for Moses who was about to lead them 
              on a journey of faith and deliverance. We can be sure that Moses 
              understood Yahweh to mean more than an identifying label for God,

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For example, in Genesis 22 when Abraham 
              is told to sacrifice Isaac, God reveals Himself as <i>Yahweh-raah</i> 
              (or Jehovah-jireh). In verse 8, Abraham said to Isaac, &quot;God 
              will provide for Himself the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.&quot; 
              When God did provide a ram for the burnt offering, &quot;Abraham 
              called the name of that place The LORD Will Provide (Yahweh-raah), 
              as it is said to this day, &quot;In the mount of the LORD it will 
              be provided&quot; (vs. 14). The <i>place</i> was called Yahweh-raah 
              but Yahweh revealed Himself as God who provides what he asks for 
              in return. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Likewise, in Exodus 17, Israel waged 
              war against the Amalekites. As long as Moses held up the staff of 
              God, Israel prevailed. When Moses' arms were lowered, the enemy 
              prevailed. Soon Aaron and Hur supported Moses' arms so that the 
              Amalekites were utterly defeated (see vs. 8-13). &quot;Then the 
              LORD said to Moses, &quot;Write this in a book as a memorial and 
              recite it to Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of 
              Amalek from under heaven.&quot; Moses built an altar and named it 
              The LORD is My Banner; and he said, &quot;The LORD has sworn; the 
              LORD will have war against Amalek from generation to generation&quot; 
              (vs. 14-16). The altar was named <i>Yahweh-nes</i> because God fought 
              the war for Israel and prevailed. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Banner was Moses' rod and was a 
              symbol of Yahweh's faithful, powerful presence and working. It was 
              God's signal to rally to Him and among Jews it is also a word for 
              &quot;miracle.&quot; The lesson here is that Israel could not wage 
              warfare alone; Yahweh is My Banner!<sup><a name="Ref14"></a><a href="#Note14">[14]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In another situation, God reveals a 
              broader moral aspect of <i>Yahweh</i>. When Moses is leading Israel 
              in the wilderness, his discouragement brings about a fascinating 
              discussion between he and Yahweh in Exodus 33 &amp; 34. Moses' real 
              need is for God to show him His glory. This will encourage him to 
              complete the mission that God has given him. </font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">17 The LORD said to Moses, &quot;I 
                will also do this thing of which you have spoken; for you have 
                found favor in My sight and I have known you by name.&quot; 18 
                Then Moses said, &quot;I pray You, show me Your glory!&quot; 19 
                And He said, <b>&quot;I Myself will make all My <u>goodness</u> 
                pass before you, and will proclaim the <u>name</u> of the LORD</b> 
                before you; and I will be <u><b>gracious </b></u>to whom I will 
                be gracious, and will show <u><b>compassion</b></u> on whom I 
                will show compassion.&quot; 20 But He said, &quot;You cannot see 
                My face, for no man can see Me and live!&quot; (boldface, underline, 
                mine) </font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">God reveals that His <i>goodness</i>, 
              <i>graciousness</i> and <i>compassion </i>are all wrapped up and 
              defined by His name, <i>Yahweh</i>. J.I. Packer asserts this as 
              the &quot;foundational announcement of his moral character&quot; 
              and something that is echoed later in Scripture (Ps. 86:15; Joel 
              2:13).<sup><a name="Ref15"></a><a href="#Note15">[15]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              This is in answer to Moses' request of God to show His glory. It 
              is clear by the fact that Moses could only glimpse at the back of 
              God that His amazing and incomprehensible goodness is but a glimpse 
              of the glorious, perfect nature of <i>Yahweh.</i> </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Not long after this incident Yahweh 
              reveals more depth as to His moral character, desire for intimacy, 
              and covenant longing by announcing Himself as &quot;the LORD whose 
              name is Jealous (Ex. 34:14). The word <i>qanna</i>, is only used 
              5 times in Scripture and solely of God in the context of idolatry.<sup><a name="Ref16"></a><a href="#Note16">[16]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              As a name for God, <i>Jealous</i> gives power to the second commandment 
              (Ex. 20:5) which commands Israel not to make and worship idols, 
              &quot;for I am a jealous God.&quot; This of course, is not an unrighteous 
              jealousy. Instead, it &quot;is covenantal: it is the virtue of the 
              committed lover, who wants total loyalty of the one he has bound 
              himself to honor and serve.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref17"></a><a href="#Note17">[17]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although it is beyond the scope of 
              this paper to look at even hundreds of occurances of Yahweh, it 
              is clear from what we have seen that both God and Moses placed tremendous 
              importance on names. God's names progressively reveal His character. 
              Once understanding the full power of them, as Moses did in the incident 
              of the Burning Bush, it would be inconceivable to use them without 
              meaning. In addition, the name Yahweh is so intrinsically tied to 
              covenant promise that the theological meaning and practical significance 
              for Israel during the most desperate times of nationhood and in 
              the most fruitful times, is inescapable (compare Jeremiah's trust 
              in Yahweh, expressed during national exile, with David's overwhelmed 
              response to blessing in 2 Sam. 7)! </font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Elohim </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Genesis 1:1-2:4, Moses describes 
              the activity of the creation and uses the Hebrew name, <i>Elohim</i> 
              35 times in 35 verses as the agent of that creation. <i>Elohim</i> 
              is the plural form of <i>eloah</i>, and is translated as a name 
              for God 2570<sup><a name="Ref18"></a><a href="#Note18">[18]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              times in the Old Testament. It is also used to identify &quot;other

            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Albright has suggested that 
                the use of this majestic plural comes from the tendency in the 
                ancient near east toward a universalism: &quot;We find in Canaanite 
                an increasing tendency to employ the plural Ashtorot `Astartes', 
                and Anatot `Anaths', in the clear sense of totality of manifestations 
                of a deity.&quot; But a better reason can be seen in Scripture 
                itself where, in the very first chapter of Gen., the necessity 
                of a term conveying both the unity of the one God and yet allowing 
                for a plurality of persons is found (Gen. 1:2,26). This is further 
                born out by the fact that the form elohim occurs only in Hebrew 
                and in no other Semitic language, not even Biblical Aramaic.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref19"></a><a href="#Note19">[19]</a></sup>&nbsp;

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Elohim</i> is a word that describes 
              the divine activity. In contrast to <i>Yahweh</i> as the immanent 
              and personal covenant God, <i>Elohim</i> is the Transcendent; the 
              Mighty Creator to be feared and awed by men. Elohim expresses greatness, 
              glory, and inherently contains the ideas of &quot;creative and governing 
              power, omnipotence and sovereignty.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref20"></a><a href="#Note20">[20]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              When Elohim creates, the special verb <i>bara'</i> is used. God 
              is always the subject of this verb and it separates God's creative 
              acts from all human comparison. The creation of Elohim is unique.<sup><a name="Ref21"></a><a href="#Note21">[21]</a></sup>&nbsp;

                it, for those were days of slavery. Lordship meant complete possession 
                on the one hand, and complete submission on the other. As already 
                seen, Abraham himself sustained the relationship of master and 
                lord over a very considerable number of souls; therefore in addressing 
                Jehovah as Adonai he acknowledged God's complete possession of 
                and perfect right to all that he was and had. . . . The purchased 
                slave stood in a much nearer relationship to his lord than a hired 
                servant. . . . In Israel, the hired servant who was a stranger 
                might not eat of the Passover or the holy things of the master's 
                house, but the purchased slave, as belonging to his master, and 
                so a member of the family, possessed this privilege (see Ex. 12:43-45; 
                Lev. 22:10,11). The slave had the right of the master's protection

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This aspect of the meaning of Adonai

              knew the weightiness of his own role as the <i>go'el</i>, or &quot;kinsman 
              redeemer.&quot; This idea was commonly understood in ancient family 
              law whereby the patriarch was responsible for the family in a wide 
              variety of duties. For instance, the kinsman redeemer was responsible 
              to buy back a family member who had been sold into slavery (Lev. 
              25:48ff.), or to buy back a family field which had been lost (Lev. 
              25:25). In addressing God as <i>Adonai</i>, Abram is recognizing 
              God as his Go'el. God is his <i>Master</i> and Abram will look to

              that etymology yields nothing! He cites S. R. Driver in saying that 
              neither Hebrew nor any other of the cognate Semitic languages offer 
              any sufficient explanation of it. In a general sense, he sees this 
              name as communicating the thought of God's power either in blessing,

              The context for the use of the name Shaddai outside of Job, is the 
              covenant. First, to Abraham (as we have seen in Gen. 17:1), then 
              to Isaac (Gen. 28:3), and finally to Jacob (Gen. 35:11; 43:14; 48:3).

              This occurs 21 times in the Old Testament, some of which are found

              the prophecies of Isaiah and Ezekial as gestures of mourning and

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Stone also argues that many ancient

              female images in order to bring forth blessings of rain which would 
              yield the fruit of the field necessary to sustain and nourish life. 
              He also notes that the &quot;common Hebrew word for field, (sadeh) 
              . . . is simply another form of the word shaddai. It is the field 
              as cultivated earth which nourishes and sustains life.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref42"></a><a href="#Note42">[42]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;From all this it is felt that 
              the name <i>El-Shaddai</i> or <i>God Almighty</i> is much better 
              understood as that El who is all sufficient and all bountiful, the 
              source of all blessing and fullness and fruitfulness.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref43"></a><a href="#Note43">[43]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With this in view, it makes sense that 
              the God who will bless Abraham with a son in fulfillment of His 
              promise, would be El-Shaddai, source of all blessing. It is also 
              not surprising that the other instances of this name occur in the 
              context of the promise of progeny and the command to &quot;be fruitful 
              and multiply&quot; to Isaac and Jacob as well. Shaddai blesses, 
              nourishes and sustains the progeny of promise. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Walter Kaiser identifies the &quot;blessing&quot; 
              motif as the earliest expression of the promise. He says: </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For men, it involved more than the 
              divine gift of proliferation and &quot;dominion having.&quot; The 
              same word also marked the immediacy whereby all the nations of the 
              earth could prosper spiritually through the mediatorship of Abraham 
              and his seed: this too, was part of the &quot;blessing.&quot; Obviously, 
              pride of place must be given to this term as the first to signify 
              the plan of God.<sup><a name="Ref44"></a><a href="#Note44">[44]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The argument that the name El-Shaddai 
              is properly and fully understood in terms of blessing, specifically 
              blessing of progeny in the covenant to the patriarchs appears reasonable. 
              But what are we to make of the majority of occurances of El-Shaddai 
              in the book of Job? In light of the probable early origins of Job 
              (quite possibly during the patriarchal period), and the fact that 
              the book is about the removal of blessing from Job in order to test 
              his faith, the choice of El-Shaddai as God's name seems most appropriate 
              if understood as the God of blessing, nourishment and sustenance! 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In support of this, there are other 
              passages in which El-Shaddai is used in connection with suffering. 
              Consider Naomi's words in 1:20, 21: &quot;She said to them, &quot;Do 
              not call me Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty (Shaddai) has 
              dealt very bitterly with me. 21&quot;I went out full, but the LORD 
              (Yahweh) has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since 
              the LORD (Yahweh) has witnessed against me and the Almighty (Shaddai) 
              has afflicted me?&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Could it be true that El-Shaddai, the 
              God of blessing, is the same God who afflicts her? The lesson here 
              is the same as it was for Job and Abraham (in his inability to conceive 
              a child), that being that in order to experience God's sufficiency 
              and receive His blessing, we must understand our insufficiency. 
              Stone comments, &quot;The less empty of self we are, the less of 
              blessing God can pour into us; the more of pride and self-sufficiency, 
              the less fruit we can bear. Sometimes only chastening can make us 
              realize this.&quot; We have to understand that God's ultimate purpose 
              is that we know God and His great love for us.<sup><a name="Ref45"></a><a href="#Note45">[45]</a></sup>&nbsp;

            <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Conclusions </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our original questions considered whether 
              or not the name/names used for God were intended to have a material 
              effect on the theological content of the scripture? Or, are they, 
              generally speaking, arbitrary, interchangeable, and a simple reflection 
              of author preference? </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There is little doubt that God fully 
              intended His name/names to be full of meaning regarding His nature 
              and character. His character is incontravertably tied up in His 
              covenant with the nation of Israel and therefore, so is His name. 
              There is no way to divorce the name of the meaning it possesses. 
              We have seen examples from Moses writings, David's, other psalmists, 
              Jeremiah, Ruth, Isaiah, and Job. All of them seem to carry an awareness 
              of the meanings of names for God and use them appropriately. The 
              fact that often the names are used together gives the reader insight 
              into the frustration of the author to communicate the whole character 
              of Israel's God. The most important aspect of these names for God, 
              and the element that connects them to the unfolding of the Promise 
              plan, is the aspect of <i>covenant</i> which we find in varying 
              degrees and with varied richness in all of them. God wants Israel 
              to know and understand Him this way. He wants them to understand 
              His ever-faithful longsuffering, and their required response of 
              obedience and faith. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our answer has to be yes. The names 
              for God do have a material effect on the theological content of 
              Scripture. Yahweh stands out as the name by which God reveals His 
              own nature, but the others aid in filling the vaccuum of our finite 
              minds. There are, no doubt, places where the names used are due 
              to author preference, but even there, we will not find an inappropriate 
              name used. God is in control. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The most significant lesson learned 
              from this is how much God wants us to know Him. He was continually 
              at work expanding and revealing Israel's knowledge of Him through 
              the circumstances in their lives. He is at work expanding and revealing 
              Himself to us as well . God will show <i>us</i> His glory as He 
              did for Moses, because His covenant with us is part of who He is; 
              His commitment is everlasting. </font></p>

              Ibid., pg. 44. The plural ending is usually descried as one of majesty 
              and not intended as true plural when used of God. The noun, elohim, 
              is consistently used with singular verb forms, adjectives and pronouns. 
              This objection to the Trinity in the name Elohim is rejected by 
              conservative scholars like Nathan Stone who also cites John Calvin. 
              They argue that the majestic plural (ie: that used of kings) was 
              not known then. The plural form with the singular pronoun, etc. 
              is fully consistent with the doctrine of the Trinity. (See Nathan

              This psalmist makes use of the names, Elohim, Adonay, Yahweh, as 
              well as the general, El. As we have seen, the use of many names 
              is not uncommon and, either the psalmist is using the names interchangeably, 
              or, he is exploring and exposing the whole character and nature 
              of God? In the following exerpt from the same psalm, we can see 
              the reason for the psalmist to be questioning God's whole character.

              my spirit ponders: 7 Will the Lord (Adonai) reject forever? And 
              will He never be favorable again? 8 Has His lovingkindness ceased 
              forever? Has <i>His</i> promise come to an end forever? 9 Has God

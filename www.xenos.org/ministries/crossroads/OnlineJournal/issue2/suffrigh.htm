            addressed more deeply and directly in the wisdom literature of the 
            Old Testament than in any other section of scripture. In particular, 
            understanding the message of the book of Job and how it relates to 
            the issues of suffering, prosperity, and righteousness is a substantial 
            but rewarding task. In the process of investigating these issues, 
            there are also questions of consistency to resolve. Consider these 
            passages:</font>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The tents of the destroyers 
                prosper, and those who provoke God are secure...&quot; Job 12:6</font></p>

                continue on, also become very powerful? Their descendants are 
                established with them in their sight, and their offspring before 
                their eyes, their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod 
                of God on them. His ox mates without fail; his cow calves and 
                does not abort. They send forth their little ones like the flock, 
                and their children skip about. They sing to the timbrel and harp 
                and rejoice at the sound of the flute. They spend their days in 
                prosperity, and suddenly they go down to Sheol. And they say to 
                God, 'Depart from us! We do not even desire the knowledge of your 
                ways. Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him, and what 
                would we gain if we entreat him?'&quot; Job 21:7-15</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;For I was envious of the arrogant, 
                as I saw the prosperity of the wicked. For there are no pains 
                in their death; and their body is fat. They are not in trouble 
                as other men; nor are they plagued like mankind. Therefore pride 
                is their necklace; the garment of violence covers them. Their 
                eye bulges from fatness; the imaginations of their heart run riot. 
                They mock, and wickedly speak of oppression; they speak from on 
                high. They have set their mouth against the heavens, and their 
                tongue parades through the earth.&quot; Psalms 73:3-9</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">These are three examples of a theme 
              found in the wisdom literature. The claim is that prosperity, far 
              from being associated with righteousness, is actually associated 
              with wicked behavior. It is not difficult to find confirming examples 
              from the history of humanity. But consider these:</font></p>

                he is gracious and compassionate and righteous. It is well with 
                the man who is gracious and lends; he will maintain his cause

            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">These seven quotes trace a theme found 
              most noticeably in Proverbs, but which as we see is also present 
              in the Psalms (and actually in the book of Job) as well. This claim 
              is that righteousness results in prosperity and deliverance from 
              suffering. Here too it is possible to find concrete examples in 
              our own lives which confirm this notion. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Coming to a thorough understanding 
              of the teaching of the wisdom literature on this subject brings 
              an awareness of the unity of this material in these issues, as well 
              as providing practical insights for living in this world. </font></p>

            <p><b></b><font face="Arial" size="2">It is important to begin with 
              some brief definitions of our key terms. </font>
            <dir><b> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Righteousness</font></p>
              </b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The word means right-ness; in the 
                biblical context it means having the quality of being right as 
                measured by the standard of God's moral character. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the book of Job, as well as in 
                the wisdom literature and indeed in the Bible as a whole, righteousness 
                has two senses which could be described as <i>absolute</i> and 
                <i>relative</i>. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For example, consider the use of 
                the term in these passages:</font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;What is man, that he should 
                  be pure, or he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?&quot; 
                  Job 15:14</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;For Job has said, 'I am righteous, 
                  but God has taken away my right.'&quot; Job 34:5 (A fair summary 
                  by Elihu--see Job 10:14 and 13:23)</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Better is the little of the 
                  righteous than the abundance of many wicked.&quot; Psalms 37:16</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;For the arms of the wicked 
                  will be broken; but the Lord sustains the righteous.&quot; Psalms 
                  37:17</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Give instruction to a wise man, 
                  and he will be still wiser, teach a righteous man, and he will 
                  increase his learning.&quot; Proverbs 9:9</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The first use of the term is in an 
                <i>absolute</i> sense. Numerous passages in scripture using this 
                and other related terms like sin affirm that no human being but 
                Christ himself is righteous in this absolute sense. Only by God's 
                forgiveness, in which, in response to faith, God imparts his righteousness 
                to people, can anyone be righteous in this sense.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The remaining passages are examples 
                of the by far more common usage of the term throughout the wisdom 
                literature (literally hundreds of such passages) in which righteousness 
                is a <i>relative</i> term. While it is not moral perfection, yet 
                it is substantially different and clearly distinguishable from 
                wickedness. Job chapter 31 is an excellent extended description 
                of it; verse after verse in Psalms and Proverbs reference this 
                quality of relative righteousness. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As absolute righteousness is beyond 
                our ability to achieve in this life, and also because the relative 
                usage is by far the most common one in our passages, our discussion 
                will focus on this term in its relative sense. </font></p>
              <b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Prosperity</font></p>
              </b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Prosperity in the context of this 
                discussion refers not only to having the necessities of physical 
                existence (a sufficiency of food, shelter, clothing), but also 
                to at least modest material wealth, physical health, as well as 
                some basic relational well-being, including a family and social 
                respect. Job's situation serves as the primary model. The book 
                begins with the list of the elements of his prosperity--his possessions, 
                his wealth, and his family--and we discover during his subsequent 
                laments that he also held a respected position of leadership in 
                the community. The book ends with a description of his even greater 
                prosperity, including all these elements.</font></p>
              <b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Suffering</font></p>
              </b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Here again, Job's situation serves 
                as the primary model. After the challenge from Satan prompts God 
                to give him permission, Satan inflicts a variety of terrible things 
                on him, including the loss of his physical health and the complete 
                loss of his wealth, as well as the deaths of his children and 
                loss of respect of his community. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Message of the Book of Job</font></p>
            </b>
            <p><b></b><font face="Arial" size="2">We begin the task of assessing 
              the message of the wisdom literature on this question of righteousness, 
              suffering, and prosperity by distilling the message of the book 
              of Job on this issue. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is obvious from even a cursory reading 
              of it that the book of Job deals with the issue of righteousness, 
              suffering and prosperity. What is not at all obvious is what the 
              message of the book on this issue is. The reason for the difficulty 
              is that there are a variety of voices speaking in the book, with 
              substantial disagreements between them. It requires careful analysis 
              to determine which elements of the various positions taken by those 
              various voices are affirmed as correct in God's view, and from that 
              information deduce the overall message of the book. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">These are the various voices who play 
              a part in defining the message of the book of Job: </font>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We will examine the contribution of 
              each, distilling the point we are to take away from their contributions 
              especially in regard to the key questions of a) was Job righteous 
              and b) what effect did his righteousness have on his prosperity 
              and suffering. </font>
            <dir><b> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Narrator</font></p>
              </b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The narrator informs us in the first 
                two chapters that although Job enjoyed great prosperity, his trouble 
                began as a direct result of his righteousness and Satan's accusation 
                against God related to Job's righteousness. This passage is key 
                not only for understanding the book of Job but actually the entirety 
                of evil and suffering in human history:</font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;And the Lord said to Satan, 
                  'have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one like 
                  him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, fearing God and 
                  turning away from evil.' Then Satan answered the Lord, 'Does 
                  Job fear God for nothing? Have you not made a hedge about him 
                  and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed 
                  the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in 
                  the land. But put forth your hand now and touch all that he 
                  has; he will surely curse you to your face.'&quot; Job 1:8-11</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The essence of this claim is that 
                no free being would willingly follow God for any motive other 
                than bribery; conversely, if the immediate benefits of following 
                God were removed, if prosperity were replaced with suffering, 
                then allegiance to God will be jettisoned. The claim is therefore 
                that there is no intrinsic value in knowing and serving God, and 
                that the value for allegiance to God is solely in extracting prosperity 
                from him. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The result of this accusation is 
                that God gives Satan permission, in two stages (Job 1:12 and again 
                in 2:6) to destroy Job's prosperity and replace it with intense 
                physical and psychological suffering. Job is left in a state of 
                terrible physical pain, also facing the total destruction of his 
                wealth, the death of his children, and the loss of the respect 
                of his society. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The position of the narrator, then, 
                is that Job was righteous, that Job's initial prosperity and his 
                restored prosperity at the end of the book (42:10) are from the 
                hand of God, and finally that his righteousness lead directly 
                to his temporary though severe loss of prosperity and his suffering. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The narrator's position is, via the 
                evidence for the inspiration of scripture, correct and affirmed 
                by God, and therefore becomes a key component of the message of 
                the book as a whole. </font></p>

              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Satan</font></p>
              </b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Satan's voice is in agreement with 
                the narrator on these points. He explicitly claims that God is 
                the source of Job's prosperity and he does not contest God's claim 
                of Job's righteousness. He of course is perfectly aware that Job's 
                suffering is allowed by God and caused by Satan himself as a result 
                of Job's righteousness and the provocation it represents to Satan.

              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Three &quot;Friends&quot;</font></p>
              </b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Job's three friends present a unified 
                message. They are rebuked by Elihu (more on Elihu later) for providing 
                no answer to Job, and are roundly condemned by God in this passage:</font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;And it came about after the 
                  Lord had spoken these words to Job, that the Lord said to Eliphaz 
                  the Temanite, 'My wrath is kindled against you and against your 
                  two friends, because you have not spoken of me what is right 
                  as my servant Job has. Now therefore, take for yourselves seven 
                  bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up 
                  a burnt offering for yourselves, and my servant Job will pray 
                  for you. For I will accept him so that I may not do with you 
                  according to your folly, because you have not spoken of me what 
                  is right, as my servant Job has.' So Eliphaz the Temanite and 
                  Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as 
                  the Lord told them; and the Lord accepted Job.&quot; Job 42:7-9</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The key question is, what is it that 
                these three say that is incorrect? Much of what they say sounds 
                quite right and reasonable, and even harmonizes with statements 
                by Elihu (who is not rebuked) and other passages in scripture. 
                For example, consider this passage, spoken by Eliphaz.</font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;But as for me, I would seek 
                  God, and I would place my cause before God; who does great and 
                  unsearchable things, wonders without number. He gives rain on 
                  the earth, and sends water on the fields, so that he sets on 
                  high those who are lowly, and those who mourn are lifted to 
                  safety. He frustrates the plotting of the shrewd, so that their 
                  hands cannot attain success. He captures the wise by their own 
                  shrewdness and the advice of the cunning is quickly thwarted. 
                  By day they meet with darkness, and grope at noon as in the 
                  night. But he saves from the sword of their mouth, and the poor 
                  from the hand of the mighty. So the helpless has hope, and unrighteousness 
                  must shut its mouth. Behold, how happy is the man whom God reproves, 
                  so do not despise the discipline of the almighty.&quot; Job 
                  5:8-17</font></p>

              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The essential claims here can be 
                backed up from numerous other passages in scripture. What then 
                is wrong with Job's friends? We need to clarify this question 
                before we can correctly use their material in defining the message 
                of the book of Job. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Consider the following typical passages 
                which expose the heart of the arguments of the three &quot;friends&quot;:</font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Eliphaz: &quot;Remember now, who 
                  ever perished being innocent? Or where were the upright destroyed? 
                  According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity and those 
                  who sow trouble harvest it. By the breath of God they perish, 
                  and by the blast of his anger they come to an end.&quot; Job 
                  4:7-9 </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Bildad: &quot;Does God pervert 
                  justice or does the almighty pervert what is right? If your 
                  sons sinned against him, then he delivered them into the power 
                  of their transgression. If you would seek God and implore the 
                  compassion of the almighty, if you are pure and upright, surely 
                  now he would rouse himself for you and restore your righteous 
                  estate.&quot; Job 8:3-6</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Zophar: &quot;If you would direct 
                  your heart right, and spread out your hand to him; if iniquity 
                  is in your hand, put it far away, and do not let wickedness 
                  dwell in your tents. Then, indeed, you could lift up your face 
                  without moral defect, and you would be steadfast and not fear. 
                  For you would forget your trouble, as waters that have passed 
                  by, you would remember it. And your life would be brighter than 
                  noonday; darkness would be like the morning. Then you would 
                  trust, because there is hope; and you would look around and 
                  rest securely. You would lie down and none would disturb you, 
                  and many would entreat your favor. But the eyes of the wicked 
                  will fail, and there will be no escape for them; and their hope 
                  is to breathe their last.&quot; Job 11:13-20</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Note the consistent claims (these 
                are representative of many other examples) that Job would be fine 
                if he would repent of his sinfulness. Bildad goes so far as to 
                claim that the death of Job's sons was a result of their own sins 
                (Job 8:4). Their evaluation of Job's situation is based on the 
                belief that the world is a perfect ongoing reflection of God's 
                justice, and therefore that suffering in the world comes only 
                as the result of God's judgment on individuals for their sinfulness. 
                The message of the three friends is then to deny that Job is righteous, 
                and to argue that actually his loss of prosperity, the suffering 
                now present in his life, comes directly from God's hand in response 
                to particular sins committed by Job. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The view of the three friends is 
                not only incorrect in Job's situation, but is clearly a terrible 
                slander against God when extended to all of the evil and suffering 
                present in the world. It is clear that throughout human history 
                good people often suffer at the hands of evil people who themselves 
                prosper. To describe the present state of affairs, the events 
                of human history including each deprivation and painful experience, 
                as an illustration of the ongoing justice of God against particular 
                sins of individuals is indeed to speak incorrectly of God's character. 
                The result is to describe God as unjust, inconsistent, and ultimately 
                evil. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We can distill what we are to learn 
                through God's condemnation of the message of Job's friends this 
                way: prosperity and suffering in this life are not necessarily 
                the result of God's intervention of blessing or judgment due to 
                the righteousness of individuals. When we see someone suffering, 
                we can not conclude that God is judging them for particular sins. 
                God's justice is not now being exercised in any complete sense.

              <b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Elihu</font></p>
              </b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Elihu is the fourth of Job's friends. 
                He remains silent until chapter 32, when the other three friends 
                give up their arguments with Job. He tells us that he is younger 
                then the others, and so has waited until last to speak. His speech 
                is lengthy, consuming chapters 32-37. Like the other three friends, 
                Elihu rebukes Job. Unlike the other three friends, however, he 
                is exempted from God's rebuke. Why? </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The reason is that Elihu's issue 
                with Job is substantially different from that of the other three 
                friends. Elihu begins his speech in chapter 32 by pointing out 
                that the other three friends have accused Job and yet failed to 
                answer his arguments. Elihu then says that Job is wrong to accuse 
                God of injustice, as these examples show. </font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Surely you have spoken in 
                  my hearing, and I have heard the sound of your words: 'I am 
                  pure, without transgression; I am innocent and there is no guilt 
                  in me. Behold, he invents pretexts against me; he counts me 
                  as his enemy. He puts my feet in the stocks; he watches all 
                  my paths.' Behold, let me tell you, you are not right in this, 
                  for God is greater than man. Why do you complain against him, 
                  that he does not give an account of all his doings?&quot; Job 
                  33:8-13</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The almighty--we cannot find 
                  him; he is exalted in power; and he will not do violence to 
                  justice and abundant righteousness.&quot; Job 37:23</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Notice that unlike the three friends 
                he never disputes Job's claim to essential innocence; however 
                he does dispute Job's complaint that God is unjustly causing his 
                suffering. The basis of his argument, developed across these 5 
                chapters, is an appeal to God's power and his just character. 
                These are the same points that God himself makes when he intervenes 
                personally in the final chapters of the book. Elihu's message 
                is part of the message God wants us to take away from the book 
                of Job: God may allow suffering for righteousness' sake, and may 
                not explain the exact reasons behind the turn of events. In such 
                situations, God's wisdom and power provide a sufficient basis 
                for trusting him. </font></p>
              <b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Job</font></p>
              </b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Distilling the message of Job's own 
                words in the book of Job is even more challenging than doing so 
                for his three friends, for two reasons: first, Job is less consistent 
                throughout the book on some issues, and second the verdict by 
                God and the narrator on Job's statements is less clear-cut than 
                their verdict on Job's three friends. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Job repeatedly and unambiguously 
                claims his own righteousness. For example:</font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;But it is still my consolation, 
                  and I rejoice in unsparing pain, that I have not denied the 
                  words of the Holy One.&quot; Job 6:10</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;My face is flushed from weeping, 
                  and deep darkness is on my eyelids, although there is no violence 
                  in my hands, and my prayer is pure.&quot; Job 16:16-17</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;My foot has held fast to 
                  [God's] path; I have kept his way and not turned aside. I have 
                  not departed from the command of his lips; I have treasured 
                  the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.&quot; Job 
                  23:11-12</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;My lips certainly will not 
                  speak unjustly, nor will my tongue mutter deceit. Far be it 
                  from me that I should declare you [the three friends] right; 
                  till I die I will not put away my integrity from me. I hold 
                  fast my righteousness and will not let it go. My heart does 
                  not reproach any of my days.&quot; Job 27:4-6</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, chapter 31 is a detailed 
                description of his merciful and generous life, free from sexual 
                impurity, greed, and idolatry. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As we have seen, the narrator affirms 
                that Job is initially in a state of righteousness. Further, we 
                have these two statements by the narrator given at the conclusion 
                of Job's first two speeches:</font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Through all this Job did 
                  not sin nor did he blame God.&quot; Job 1:22</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Then his wife said to him, 
                  'Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die!' 
                  But he said to her, 'You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. 
                  Shall we indeed accept good from God and not accept adversity?&quot; 
                  In all this Job did not sin with his lips.&quot; Job 2:9-10</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, it is apparent that some 
                time after this point Job does begin to stray. We know this because 
                the narrator ceases his affirmations, because Elihu rebukes Job 
                for his accusations against God, and most importantly because 
                when God appears in person and addresses Job, he says this:</font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Then the Lord answered Job 
                  out of the whirlwind and said, 'Who is this that darkens counsel 
                  by words without knowledge?'&quot; Job 38:1-2</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If God himself clues us in that Job 
                has strayed, Elihu's rebuke brings Job's problem into clear focus, 
                namely that Job is wrong to accuse God of injustice, as we saw 
                earlier. And indeed Job, after his first two speeches, begins 
                to ascribe injustice to God, as in this example:</font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;For he bruises me with a 
                  tempest, and multiplies my wounds without cause. He will not 
                  allow me to get my breath, but saturates me with bitterness. 
                  If it is a matter of power, behold, he is the strong one! And 
                  if it is a matter of justice, who can summon him? Though I am 
                  righteous, my mouth will condemn me; though I am guiltless, 
                  he will declare me guilty. I am guiltless; I do not take notice 
                  of myself; I despise my life. It is all one; therefore I say, 
                  'He destroys the guiltless and the wicked.'&quot; Job 9:17-22</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Job then rightly maintains that his 
                suffering was not the result of God's judgment against his sin. 
                He is wrong, however, to claim that his suffering is the result 
                of injustice from God against him. When he is finally given a 
                personal revelation of God, he retracts, and asks only to be taught 
                by God:</font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I know that you can do all 
                  things, and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted. 'Who is 
                  this that hides counsel without knowledge?' Therefore I have 
                  declared that which I did not understand, things too wonderful 
                  for me, which I did not know. Hear, now, and I will speak; I 
                  will ask you, and you instruct me. I have heard of you by the 
                  hearing of the ear; but now my eye sees you; therefore I retract, 
                  and I repent in dust and ashes.&quot; Job 42:2-6</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In spite of Job's rebuke at the hands 
                of Elihu and God himself, Job is given an overall commendation 
                by God. We already cited the passage in which God contrasts Job 
                to the three friends in chapter 42:7ff, claiming that Job has 
                in general spoken rightly of God. This overall commendation is 
                due to his refusal to jettison his personal commitment to God. 
                We see this especially in these three outstanding statements of 
                faith:</font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;And [Job] said, 'Naked I 
                  came from my mother's womb, and naked I shall return there. 
                  The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away. Blessed be the name 
                  of the Lord.&quot; Job 1:21</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Though he slay me, I will 
                  hope in him.&quot; Job 13:15</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;And as for me, I know that 
                  my redeemer lives, and at the last he will take his stand on 
                  the earth. Even after my skin is destroyed, yet from my flesh 
                  I shall see God...&quot; Job 19:25-26</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Job is a righteous man, who correctly 
                understands that his suffering is not the result of God's justice, 
                but falls into a trap by assuming his suffering is the result 
                of God's injustice. However, he remains an outstanding example 
                of faith in the midst of suffering. Satan's hope, that in the 
                face of suffering Job would curse God, was shattered. </font></p>

              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">God</font></p>
              </b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">By now we have touched on the important 
                points made by God in his personal appearance in chapters 38-42. 
                He rebukes Job for his accusation of injustice against God. He 
                makes a long and effective contrast between Job's power and knowledge 
                and God's, and in essence argues that God has good reasons for 
                the decisions he makes, including those impacting Job. Interestingly, 
                Job is never given the information that we, through the narrator, 
                are given for the specific reasons in Job's case. Instead, God's 
                solution for Job is to reveal himself personally to Job. </font></p>
              <b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Summary of the Message of the Book 
                of Job</font></p>
              </b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In summary, the message of the book 
                of Job is that the issue of righteousness, prosperity, and suffering 
                is complex. On the one hand, righteousness brings God's support, 
                which in general includes prosperity. We see this in the fact 
                that Job's prosperity, both before and after his suffering, is 
                ascribed to God. On the other hand, the state of affairs in this 
                world is not the result of God's just intervention, but is instead 
                impacted by God's enemy, Satan. The wicked do indeed prosper in 
                some cases, and in others righteousness itself brings suffering, 
                as in the case of Job, at least temporarily. In such situations 
                God may not explain the reasons for these things; however he has 
                reasons and may be trusted based on his wisdom and power. </font></p>

            </b>
            <p><b></b><font face="Arial" size="2">As noted in the introduction, 
              there are some apparent conflicts between Job and Proverbs, with 
              selected passages from Psalms falling on both sides of the divide. 
              The conflict can be summarized this way. Some passages seem to claim 
              that prosperity is the result of righteousness and God's resulting 
              support, while other passages claim that prosperity is enjoyed by 
              wicked people who grasp for wealth and oppress others to get it. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The best way to begin the harmonization 
              of these passages is by summarizing the teaching of the book of 
              Proverbs on the issue of righteousness, prosperity, and suffering. 
              The result will be the clear emergence of a unified and harmonious 
              set of teachings on this issue across the wisdom literature. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A survey of the book of Proverbs uncovers 
              the following themes that touch on the topic of righteousness, prosperity, 
              and suffering. </font>
            <dir><b> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A Righteous Life Tends to Bring Prosperity</font></p>
              </b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Proverbs teaches that in general, 
                a righteous life will tend to bring prosperity. It is this point 
                more than any of the others in Proverbs that appears difficult 
                to reconcile with Job. However, the difficulties disappear with 
                a clear understanding of what this teaching is and is not. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">First, Proverbs teaches what we sometimes 
                call &quot;work ethic&quot;. Here are some examples of this very 
                prominent theme in Proverbs. </font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Poor is he who works with 
                  a negligent hand, but the hand of the diligent makes rich.&quot; 
                  Proverbs 10:4</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;He who loves pleasure will 
                  become a poor man; he who loves wine and oil will not become 
                  rich.&quot; Proverbs 21:17</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Do you see a man skilled 
                  in his work? He will stand before kings; he will not stand before 
                  obscure men.&quot; Proverbs 22:29</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The observation is simply that godly 
                character, which includes the ability to perform consistent, quality 
                work, has the result of increasing prosperity. On the other hand 
                an unrighteous character includes laziness (or sluggardliness, 
                to use the favorite term of the Proverbs) which has the opposite 
                result, namely poverty. </font></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, as we noted in the introduction, 
                there is a set of proverbs (we cited 10:22, 13:21, 15:6, 22:4, 
                and 24:3-4) that make the general point that prosperity is a good 
                thing, a blessing from God. By way of reminder, here is Proverbs 
                10:22:</font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;It is the blessing of the 
                  Lord that makes rich, and he adds no sorrow to it.&quot; Proverbs 
                  10:22</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Having a sufficiency for physical 
                needs, along with the other elements of prosperity as we've defined 
                it, is pleasant and enjoyable, and it is God's ultimate plan that 
                people have prosperity. We wonder: does God's basic plan for people 
                include an abundant provision for physical and emotional needs? 
                Proverbs (as well as the rest of scripture) answers that yes it 
                does. This point is almost self-evident, and yet it is important 
                to be clear because there is sometimes a suspicion against God 
                that his desire for human beings excludes prosperity and is only 
                suffering. In summary, then, prosperity is a good thing, providing 
                it as a blessing is part of God's general intention toward human 
                beings, and it will <i>tend</i> to come from righteousness. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now if Proverbs is saying that prosperity 
                will <i>always</i> come from righteousness in this life, then 
                we do indeed have a contradiction with Job. However, if we take 
                into account the context of the entire message of Proverbs, it 
                becomes clear that we cannot make Proverbs say either that all 
                prosperity comes from God due to people's righteousness, or that 
                righteousness will always result in prosperity in this life. We 
                need to examine the other major teachings in Proverbs on the issue 
                of righteousness, prosperity, and suffering. </font></p>
              <b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Don't Make Wealth a Primary Goal 
                or a Source of Security</font></p>
              </b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Proverbs the explicit goal of 
                gaining wealth is roundly condemned, as is the attempt to place 
                one's security in wealth. This is a critical practical balance 
                to the previous point. Consider these examples:</font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Do not weary yourself to 
                  gain wealth, cease from your consideration of it. When you set 
                  your eyes on it, it is gone. For wealth certainly makes itself 
                  wings, like an eagle that flies toward the heavens.&quot; Proverbs 
                  23:4-5</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;A faithful man will abound 
                  with blessings, but he who makes haste to be rich will not go 
                  unpunished.&quot; Proverbs 28:20</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;A man with an evil eye hastens 
                  after wealth, and does not know that want will come upon him.&quot; 
                  Proverbs 28:22</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In other words, don't make wealth 
                an idol, whether or not you have it. It should not be the center 
                post of life, but only a peripheral though good aspect of life.

              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Use Wealth as an Opportunity for 
                Generosity</font></p>
              </b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Proverbs also makes a strong point 
                that those with wealth have a responsibility to be generous with 
                it, particularly toward the poor. Consider the following examples:</font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The generous man will be 
                  prosperous, and he who waters will himself be watered.&quot; 
                  Proverbs 11:25</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The rich and the poor have 
                  a common bond, the Lord is the maker of them all.&quot; Proverbs 
                  22:2</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;He who is generous will be 
                  blessed, for he gives some of his food to the poor.&quot; Proverbs 
                  22:9</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;He who oppresses the poor 
                  to make much for himself or who gives to the rich, will only 
                  come to poverty.&quot; Proverbs 22:16</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Based on the view of human nature 
                seen here in Proverbs as well as in the rest of scripture, namely 
                that human beings are all of high and equal value before God, 
                it is inconceivable to advocate enjoying prosperity without attempting 
                to do something about the inequality present in this life. Prosperity 
                is a stewardship fulfilled by generosity toward others who lack 
                even basic sustenance and cannot help themselves. </font></p>
              <b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Being Poor and Righteous is Better 
                than being Rich and Wicked</font></p>
              </b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">An important part of the teaching 
                of Proverbs on this subject, especially in terms of harmonization 
                with Job, is the theme that although prosperity is a good thing, 
                righteousness is more important when it comes to a choice between 
                them. Consider these examples:</font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Better is the poor who walks 
                  in his integrity, than he who is crooked though he be rich.&quot; 
                  Proverbs 28:6</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The rich man is wise in his 
                  own eyes, but the poor who has understanding sees through him.&quot; 
                  Proverbs 28:11</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A good name is to be more desired 
                  than great riches, favor is better than silver and gold.&quot; 
                  Proverbs 22:1</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As important as this teaching is 
                from a practical standpoint, it is critical from a harmonization 
                standpoint. The reason is that even though Proverbs doesn't teach 
                explicitly that in some cases righteousness may bring suffering 
                rather than prosperity, yet this set of passages makes it clear 
                that Proverbs acknowledges these categories of the righteous poor 
                and the prosperous wicked. </font></p>
              <b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">God Will Judge the Wicked</font></p>
              </b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Proverbs contains a prominent theme 
                that ultimately God will punish the wicked and they will lose 
                their prosperity. Of all the themes in Proverbs noted so far, 
                this one has the most references. Here is an assortment of examples:</font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The righteous is delivered 
                  from trouble, but the wicked takes his place.&quot; Proverbs 
                  11:8</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;For the upright will live 
                  in the land, and the blameless will remain in it; but the wicked 
                  will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be uprooted 
                  from it.&quot; Proverbs 2:21-22</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;His own iniquities will capture 
                  the wicked, and he will be held with the cords of his sin.&quot; 
                  Proverbs 5:22</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The memory of the righteous 
                  is blessed, but the name of the wicked will rot.&quot; Proverbs 
                  10:7</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The wages of the righteous 
                  is life, the income of the wicked, punishment.&quot; Proverbs 
                  10:16</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;When the whirlwind passes, 
                  the wicked is no more, but the righteous has an everlasting 
                  foundation.&quot; Proverbs 10:25</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The fear of the Lord prolongs 
                  life, but the years of the wicked will be shortened.&quot; Proverbs 
                  10:27</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The righteousness of the 
                  blameless will smooth his way, but the wicked will fall by his 
                  own wickedness.&quot; Proverbs 11:5</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In many of the passages on this theme 
                in Proverbs, it is not clear whether these outcomes of judgment 
                against the wicked are the result of the direct intervention of 
                God or the natural outcome of living contrary to God's will and 
                design. A survey of all this material leads to the conclusion 
                that both are being taught, as they are through the rest of scripture. 
                Some aspects of judgment are worked out as the natural results 
                of wicked behavior. Other aspects are from the intervention of 
                God in judgment. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another question is whether or not 
                this day of reckoning for wickedness comes in this life or in 
                the next. Many passages in Proverbs, including some of those quoted 
                above, imply at least that it is at the end of this life that 
                the reckoning occurs; others indicate that wickedness will be 
                punished in this life. </font></p>
              <b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Job and Proverbs are in Harmony</font></p>
              </b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We can now stand back and see that 
                there is no conflict between any of these teachings in Proverbs 
                understood in light of the full context of the book and those 
                in the book of Job. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Just as God is the source of Job's 
                prosperity, both before and after his time of suffering, so Proverbs 
                affirms in a general sense that prosperity is a good thing in 
                God's view, and that a righteous character will tend to bring 
                a life of prosperity. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The teachings in Proverbs that wealth 
                should never be an idol and should be used as an opportunity for 
                generosity are also present in Job as well. Consider this example 
                (Job is speaking):</font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;If I have despised the claim 
                  of my male or female slaves when they filed a complaint against 
                  me, what then could I do when God arises, and when He calls 
                  me to account, what will I answer Him? Did not he who made me 
                  in the womb make him, and the same one fashion us in the womb? 
                  If I have kept the poor from their desire, or have caused the 
                  eyes of the widow to fail, or have eaten my morsel alone, and 
                  the orphan has not shared it (but from my youth he grew up with 
                  me as with a father, and from infancy I guided her), if I have 
                  seen anyone perish for lack of clothing, or that the needy had 
                  no covering, if his loins have not thanked me, and if he has 
                  not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep, if I have lifted 
                  up my hand against the orphan, because I saw I had support in 
                  the gate, let my shoulder fall from the socket, and my arm be 
                  broken off at the elbow. For calamity from God is a terror to 
                  me, and because of his majesty I can do nothing. If I have put 
                  my confidence in gold, and called fine gold my trust, if I have 
                  gloated because my wealth was great, and because my hand had 
                  secured so much; if I have looked at the sun when it shone, 
                  or the moon going in splendor, and my heart became secretly 
                  enticed, and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth, that too would 
                  have been an iniquity calling for judgment, for I would have 
                  denied God above.&quot; Job 31:13-28</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Most importantly, Proverbs has no 
                quarrel with the assertion from Job that at times the wicked prosper 
                and the righteous suffer. While it is not a major theme, yet we 
                have seen that the category exists in Proverbs for the righteous 
                poor and the prosperous wicked. Proverbs is not therefore teaching 
                that the righteous will always be prosperous, nor that the wicked 
                will always be suffering; there is therefore no contradiction 
                between Proverbs and Job on this point.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, there is no conflict with 
                Job on the teaching of Proverbs that God will judge the wicked, 
                to some extent through the natural results of their wickedness, 
                as well as by the intervention of God, to some extent in this 
                life, and to a complete extent at the end of this life. God intervenes 
                in the book of Job to rebuke Job's three &quot;friends&quot; and 
                to restore Job's fortunes. In addition, Elihu affirms that God 
                will indeed bring about complete justice on the earth. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Proverbs, as in Job, we see that 
                the relationship between righteousness, prosperity, and suffering 
                is complex, and that there is a harmonious teaching on the issue.

              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The material in Psalms on this topic 
                of righteousness, prosperity, and suffering affirms all the points 
                we have listed so far, and provides some clarification on the 
                issue of the ultimate judgment of the wicked. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Here are some examples from Psalms 
                which serve to demonstrate that the same teachings seen so far 
                in Job and Proverbs are present.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Here we see the teaching that God's 
                will includes prosperity for the righteous:</font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Wealth and riches are in 
                  [God's] house, and his righteousness endures forever.&quot; 
                  Psalms 112:3</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Here we see the teaching that riches 
                should never be an idol:</font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Behold, the man who would 
                  not make God his refuge, but trusted in the abundance of his 
                  riches, and was strong in his evil desire. But as for me, I 
                  am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the 
                  lovingkindness of God forever and ever.&quot; Psalms 52:7-8</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Men of low degree are only 
                  vanity, and men of rank are a lie; in the balances they go up; 
                  they are together lighter than breath. Do not trust in oppression, 
                  and do not vainly hope in robbery; if riches increase, do not 
                  set your heart upon them. Once God has spoken; twice I have 
                  heard this: that power belongs to God; and lovingkindness is 
                  yours, O Lord, for you recompense a man according to his work.&quot; 
                  Psalms 62:9-12</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Here is an example of a prominent 
                theme in the Psalms, which is the converse of the theme of God's 
                judgment of the wicked, namely that God will support the righteous, 
                delivering them from trouble. Psalms abounds with statements like 
                this one:</font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;But the salvation of the 
                  righteous is from the Lord; he is their strength in time of 
                  trouble.&quot; Psalms 37:39</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Psalms also contains this excellent 
                passage exploring the tension we have been examining so far between 
                two themes. It acknowledges, as do Job and Proverbs, that God's 
                justice is not being done perfectly on earth, and thus we find 
                not only the wicked sometimes prospering but also the righteous 
                suffering, even for their righteousness. It makes the same claim 
                that God will ultimately cause the righteous to prosper and the 
                wicked to come under judgment:</font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;For I was envious of the 
                  arrogant, as I saw the prosperity of the wicked. For there are 
                  no pains in their death; and their body is fat. They are not 
                  in trouble as other men; nor are they plagued like mankind...surely 
                  in vain I have kept my heart pure, and washed my hands in innocence; 
                  for I have been stricken all day long, and chastened every morning...if 
                  I had said, I will speak thus, behold, I should have betrayed 
                  the generation of your children. When I pondered to understand 
                  this, it was troublesome in my sight until I came into the sanctuary 
                  of God; then I perceived their end. Surely you set them in slippery 
                  places; you cast them down to destruction. How they are destroyed 
                  in a moment! They are utterly swept away by sudden terrors! 
                  Like a dream when one awakes, O Lord, when aroused, you will 
                  despise their form...nevertheless I am continually with you; 
                  you have taken hold of my right hand. With your counsel you 
                  will guide me, and afterward receive me to glory. Whom have 
                  I in heaven but you? And besides you, I desire nothing on earth. 
                  My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my 
                  heart and my portion forever. For, behold, those who are far 
                  from you will perish; you have destroyed all those who are unfaithful 
                  to you. But as for me, the nearness of God is my good; I have 
                  made the Lord God my refuge, that I may tell of all your works.&quot; 
                  Psalms 73:3-5,13-14,15-20</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Psalm 73 is one of the clearest passages 
                on the afterlife in the wisdom literature, although there are 
                numerous other hints, as we've seen in Job 13:15 and 19:25-26. 
                The afterlife is a topic that comes into steadily clearer focus 
                as God gives further revelation after the period of the wisdom 
                literature. But it is the afterlife, and the notion of final judgment 
                after this life and the complete fulfillment of God's justice 
                then, that brings the last piece of the puzzle together on the 
                issue of righteousness, prosperity, and suffering. God's intention 
                to provide prosperity for the righteous will be perfectly fulfilled 
                in the next life. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Composite Teaching of the Wisdom 
              Literature on Righteousness, Prosperity, and Suffering</font></p>
            </b>
            <p><b></b><font face="Arial" size="2">The relationship between righteousness, 
              and prosperity and suffering is complex in this life. It is not 
              possible to look at a person who is prosperous and deduce from that 
              fact alone that they are or are not righteous; similarly, it is 
              not possible to deduce anything about a person's righteousness by 
              virtue of the fact that they are suffering. However, we can say 
              these things about righteousness, prosperity, and suffering. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Prosperity is good; life is so constructed 
              that in general, obedience to God will tend to increase it. However, 
              that general construction of life has been interrupted and violated 
              by the fall of humanity, and the influence of the enemy of God and 
              man, Satan. The unambiguous claim is that ultimately, in the next 
              life and throughout all subsequent eternity the wicked will lose 
              prosperity and be punished and the righteous will prosper, including 
              materially. However in this present evil age, it will often be the 
              case that righteousness will result in suffering and the lack of 
              prosperity, and wickedness will result in material gain and the 
              lack of suffering. Prosperity in this life, if it does come, is 
              a stewardship from God exercised successfully through generosity 
              to the poor.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Let's examine each of these elements 
              of the unified view of the wisdom literature with a view to its 
              practical application. </font>
            <dir><b> 
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">God's Plan for us is Prosperity and 
                Freedom from Suffering</font></p>
              </b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One practical application is to dismantle 
                the misconception that God is anti-wealth, that prosperity is 
                immoral, or viewed by God as immoral. The teaching here from the 
                wisdom literature is completely consistent with other material 
                throughout the Old and New Testaments. The teaching is that in 
                a general natural sense according to God's basic design for living, 
                as well as his ultimate inheritance for the righteous in heaven, 
                God's goal for people includes prosperity, including material 
                wealth. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This has some application in the 
                sense of the Christian learning to work effectively and productively, 
                a major theme in Proverbs--i.e. to develop a good work ethic. 
                One indication of the attainment of this goal will be some measure 
                of material prosperity. A lack of sufficient income may indicate 
                laziness, not righteousness. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, it has application for 
                us as a counter to the general accusation continually leveled 
                against God by the enemy that God's desire for us is to leave 
                our deepest needs and desires unfulfilled. In this particular 
                area of prosperity, of ease and lack of suffering, God's will 
                is made plain: he will satisfy this aspect of our longings and 
                desires in abundant fashion. The primary fulfillment of this promise 
                is in the next life, but there is a practical significance to 
                understanding that this is indeed God's will. He does not desire 
                our poverty, our suffering. He will indeed provide for our needs 
                in this life; he will abundantly supply us with wealth and honor 
                in the next life. </font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I love those who love me; 
                  and those who diligently seek me will find me. Riches and honor 
                  are with me, enduring wealth and righteousness. My fruit is 
                  better than gold, even pure gold, and my yield than choicest 
                  silver. I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of 
                  the paths of justice, to endow those who love me with wealth, 
                  that I may fill their treasuries.&quot; Proverbs 8:17-21</font></p>

              <b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Pursuit of Wealth Should Never Be 
                a Goal, but Prosperity Should be an Opportunity for Generosity</font></p>
              </b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The explicit goal for gaining wealth 
                is roundly condemned. Instead, wealth is something that God may 
                provide in this life as we pursue him and his will for us, and 
                will certainly provide in the next life. If wealth comes in this 
                life, then it constitutes a responsibility, a stewardship, which 
                is correctly exercised through generosity, especially to the poor. 
                As Job models for us:</font>
              <dir> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I put on righteousness, and 
                  it clothed me; my justice was like a robe and a turban. I was 
                  eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame. I was a father to the 
                  needy, and I investigated the case which I did not know. And 
                  I broke the jaws of the wicked, and snatched the prey from his 
                  teeth.&quot; Job 29:14-17</font></p>
              </dir>
              <b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In this Life Our Willingness to Suffer 
                for Righteousness is Key</font></p>
              </b>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One further practical application 
                of this material is that those who wish to follow God in this 
                present age are walking onto the center stage of a fierce spiritual 
                battle, and that decisions as to whether to trust God specifically 
                in the absence of prosperity and in the presence of suffering 
                somehow form the central means of the devil's defeat at God's 
                hands. Just as Job's righteousness constituted a provocation to 
                God's enemy, Satan, so too anyone who decides to pursue God's 
                will in this life will constitute a similar provocation. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There is a mystery here. Why is Job's 
                righteousness a provocation to Satan? What exactly is the nature 
                of the disagreement between God and Satan in this spiritual battle 
                which according to scripture is such a central driving element 
                behind human history? To fully answer this question we would have 
                to combine passages across the range of the entire Bible, but 
                the material here in Job supplies a crucial piece: part of the 
                doctrine behind Satan's rebellion is the assertion that God is 
                not good enough to be worth suffering for.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Understanding the role of righteousness 
                in the context of this ongoing spiritual battle can have profound 
                ability to provide motivation and endurance in the midst of even 
                terrible suffering in this life, as well as helping us build a 
                category for willingly enduring suffering and deprivation for 
                the sake of righteousness. Such an understanding opens our eyes 
                to the tremendous impact of even our small, secret decisions as 
                to whether to obey God or not. Such decisions ripple directly 
                into the spiritual realm. Our willingness to make such decisions 
                of obedience and faith constitute a direct act of offensive warfare 
                against the enemy of God and mankind--Satan. In so doing, in choosing 
                to pursue God based on our conviction of his goodness and faithfulness 
                even in the face of suffering, we cut the ground out from under 
                Satan's position in the spiritual war. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When we say with Job...</font>

                but only because God bribes us with present prosperity. In the 
                final analysis Job triumphed over the enemy, and was part of God's 
                triumph over the enemy. We all have the same opportunity. </font></p>

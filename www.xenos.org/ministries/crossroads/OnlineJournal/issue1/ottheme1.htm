              <p> <font face="Arial" size="2">In Genesis 1:28 God blesses Adam 
                and Eve and instructs them to be fruitful and multiply. This theme 
                reappears throughout the Old Testament during times of major transition. 
                After the flood, God blesses Noah and his sons and instructs them 
                to be fruitful and multiply. Jacob receives this promise after 
                fleeing from Esau. In addition, at the time Jacob's name is changed 
                to Israel, God reminds him he will be a great nation and charges 
                him to be fruitful and multiply. Later while in Egypt, it isthe 
                prolific nature and power of the Jewish people that causes the 
                Pharaoh to seek alternatives to curbing their growth. In spite 
                of the persecution at the hands of the Egyptians, God continues 
                to build a nation through which He will deliver the promised seed 
                of Abraham. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Both Jeremiah and Ezekiel speak of 
                this theme in the seventh century. However, they look into the 
                distant future and anticipate a time when the Messiah reigns on 
                earth. In Jeremiah 23:3, God gathers the Jewish remnant from all 
                the nations. Under the reign of the righteous Branch, they live 
                in peace and continue to multiply. Ezekiel describes this theme 
                as part of the Kingdom Age, when Israel will return to a right 
                relationship with God. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The theme &quot;be fruitful and multiply&quot; 
                includes God's blessing, a blessing not only directed at the nation 
                of Israel, but one that would ultimately apply to all the nations.</font></p>

              <p> <b></b><font face="Arial" size="2">Immediately after the fall 
                in Genesis 3, God pronounces a judgment on Satan that includes 
                a conflict with the woman's seed. The seed will experience a wound 
                on the heel, but will bruise Satan's head. Thus, we have the introduction 
                of the theological theme of the seed. God does not reveal the 
                identity of the seed, only that it is the seed of the woman. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Genesis 22:18, God promises Abraham 
                that through his seed, all the nations of the world will be blessed 
                and vows to work through his descendents, Isaac and Jacob. At 
                the conclusion of Genesis, God reveals that a ruler will come 
                from the tribe of Judah and that his reign will not end (Gen. 
                49:10). </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thousands of years later, God reveals 
                more specifically that the seed will come through a descendent 
                of David. God, speaking through Nathan the prophet, promises David 
                that his descendent will build a house, the temple of God. More 
                importantly, God promises David that he will establish his house 
                and kingdom forever (2 Sam. 7:12-15). David recognizes this is 
                a promise that will affect the future of mankind.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As God's plan unfolds, the identity 
                of the seed becomes clearer. The promise of a descendent of Abraham, 
                in whom all the nations would be blessed, includes an eternal 
                kingdom and king who will ultimately defeat Satan.</font></p>

              <p> <b></b><font face="Arial" size="2">During the patriarchal era, 
                God assures Jacob and Isaac, &quot;I will be with you&quot; in 
                Genesis 26:3-4 and 31:3, respectively. The patriarchs have God's 
                assurance that He will continue to be with them and bless them 
                as they followed his will. However, this promise is merely a precursor 
                to God's dwelling with the whole nation of Israel. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The first hint of this theme is found 
                in Exodus 4:22 during the Mosaic era. As God is preparing Moses 
                to stand before Pharaoh, He refers to Israel as &quot;My son, 
                My first born&quot;. Later in Exodus 29:43-46 we find the clearest 
                reference to this theme in the Old Testament. God commits to tabernacle, 
                or dwell, with His people. This is an incredible theme! The God 
                of the universe dwelt among His chosen people, thus completing 
                a three-part promise to Israel.<sup><a name="Ref1"></a><a href="#Note1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;

              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This theme continues into the ninth 
                century, when the prophet Joel looks forward to a day when again 
                God will dwell with His people during the millennial kingdom (Joel 
                3:21). In the eighth century, Isaiah refers to a time when God 
                again will dwell with His people at the first coming of the Messiah 
                (Isaiah 7:14). </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While God dwelling with His people 
                is an incredible theme, the ultimate provision is that of His 
                Spirit indwelling the heart of the believer. Ezekiel introduces 
                this theme during the seventh century (Ezek. 37:14). However, 
                before God could dwell among the people, the temple had to be 
                consecrated or purified (Exodus 29:44). In the same way, for God 
                to dwell in the heart of man, a purification process must take 
                place. This, of course, was accomplished through Christ. Christ's 
                death and payment for sin made it possible for God to dwell in 
                the heart of man and is a pledge of our future inheritance (Ephesians 
                1:14-15).</font></p>

                12:1 to leave his country and relatives and go to a new land. 
                Abram left the comfort and security of his home in Ur to follow 
                God's leading. According to Hebrews 11:8-9, he went by faith to 
                a land he did not know, a land he would receive as an inheritance. 
                In addition to receiving the land, God promises Abram that He 
                will bless him, make him a great nation and that through him all 
                the nations on earth will be blessed (Genesis 12:2-3). </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With this event, God introduces the 
                theme and promise that Israel, His chosen people, will become 
                a great nation and have a homeland. This is a prominent theme 
                throughout the Mosaic era. God promises His land (Lev. 25:23) 
                to the Jewish people 69 different times in the book of Deuteronomy 
                alone. He reminds the people that this promise is not new, but 
                one that was made to their fathers (Deuteronomy 19:8, 27:3). </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Shortly after the Israelites leave 
                Egypt, God summons Moses to Mount Sinai and there promises him 
                that Israel will be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (Exodus 
                19:3-6). God had miraculously protected the Jewish people and 
                allowed them to multiply while in captivity. He delivered them 
                from bondage in Egypt and they are now a nation that is ready 
                to take possession of the land God promised their fathers. However, 
                this was contingent on their ability to follow God's commands. 
                The generation that heard God's promise at Mount Sinai does not 
                take possession of the land because of their disobedience. In 
                spite of this, God did not go back on His promise. Under the leadership 
                of Joshua, the nation of Israel enters the promise land. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This theme continues into the Davidic 
                era and is a component of the covenant God establishes with David. 
                God promises to provide a place for His people where they will 
                experience rest from their enemies. In addition, David's heir 
                will build a house for God. However, more importantly, God will 
                build a house for David and establish his throne forever (2 Sam. 
                7:11-16, see <u>Eternal Dynasty and Kingdom</u>). After years 
                of unrest and persecution by the other nations, Israel experiences 
                relative peace and prosperity in their own land under the leadership 
                of David. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Later, the nation divides into two 
                kingdoms, Israel to the north with 10 tribes and Judah to the 
                south with 2 tribes. Assyria overtakes Israel and Judah fell captive 
                to Babylon. There appears to be no hope of the Jewish people regaining 
                their status as a nation. However, God speaks through the prophet 
                Ezekiel and promises to revive the nation. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Ezek. 37:12-14) &quot;Therefore 
                prophesy, and say to them, 'Thus says the LORD God, &quot;Behold, 
                I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves, 
                My people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel. {13} 
                &quot;Then you will know that I am the LORD, when I have opened 
                your graves and caused you to come up out of your graves, My people. 
                {14} &quot;And I will put My Spirit within you, and you will come 
                to life, and I will place you on your own land. Then you will 
                know that I, the LORD, have spoken and done it,&quot; declares 
                the LORD.'&quot; </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is not a bodily resurrection, 
                but a national resurrection before the Second Coming of Christ. 
                God follows through on His promise to provide a land and make 
                a nation for His people. In the NT, Stephen and the author of 
                Hebrews recount this promise to Abraham, in Acts 7:4-5 and Hebrews 
                11:8-9 respectively. They join with the rest of the NT authors 
                in looking forward to the hope of a restored nation and land, 
                a nation that experiences not only a political revival but also 
                a spiritual rebirth as described in Ezekiel 37:15-28. </font></p>

              <p> <b></b><font face="Arial" size="2">In Genesis 12:3b, God promises 
                Abraham that in him all the families of the earth would be blessed. 
                This blessing is not exclusive to Abraham or to the nation God 
                promises him. It applies to all nations, and tribes (go'wy). Later 
                in Genesis 22:17-18 God states that the source of this blessing 
                will be Abraham's seed. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This blessing is first evident when 
                the Israelites leave Egypt. In Exodus 9:20 and 12:38, Moses describes 
                a &quot;mixed multitude&quot; that includes Egyptians who fear 
                God. Throughout the Old Testament, God makes provision for people 
                from other nations who want to know Him, even placing some in 
                very prominent positions.<sup><a name="Ref2"></a><a href="#Note2">[2]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
                This theme continues in the 9th century with the prophet Joel. 
                He makes it clear, &quot;...whoever calls on the name of the Lord 
                will be delivered...&quot;. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Isaiah 49:5-6, God states that 
                Israel will be a light to the nations and that God's salvation 
                will reach the ends of the earth, not just Israel. In Isaiah 52:15, 
                the Servant suffers vicariously for men's sin, and will &quot;sprinkle 
                many nations&quot;, (go'wy) clearly an allusion to the high priest 
                sprinkling the blood on the mercy seat (Lev. 16:14). The Servant, 
                the seed of Abraham, Jesus Christ, is shown to cover the sins 
                of all mankind. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another example of God's concern 
                for the entire world is seen as He goes to great lengths to bring 
                a prophet to the Gentile city of Nineveh. The Ninevites were known 
                enemies of Israel and Jonah is reluctant to preach to these people. 
                His reluctance and lack of compassion for them is evident as he 
                waits, with anticipation, for God to judge and destroy their city. 
                However, the people repent in &quot;sackcloth and ashes&quot; 
                and God withholds judgment of the city, which angers Jonah, (Jonah 
                3:10-4:1). The book concludes with God expressing His compassion 
                for the people of Nineveh, providing further evidence that God 
                intends the blessing promised to Abraham to apply to all nations. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Jeremiah, Zechariah and Malachi look 
                forward to a time when all the nations (go'wy) of the earth surround 
                the throne of God and worship Him as King.<sup><a name="Ref3"></a><a href="#Note3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
                Clearly, these Old Testament prophets understood God's vision 
                of all nations receiving His message of salvation and blessing. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Therefore, this theme is not unique 
                to the New Testament. God intended to bless the nations from the 
                very beginning. In the New Testament, as in the Old, we see God 
                using human agency to bring the news of His blessing. Christ charges 
                His disciples to go and make disciples of all nations (ethnos) 
                (Matthew 28:18-20; Luke 24:44-49; Acts 1:8). Christ affirms in 
                the Gospel of John that there are other sheep, &quot;not of this 
                fold&quot; who must be brought in under one shepherd (John 10:16). 
                This theme is also prominent after Christ's ministry, through 
                the disciples and Paul:</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Acts 8:27-39 - The Ethiopian eunuch 
                receives Christ and is baptized. <br>
                - Acts 10:45 - After a vision from God, Peter delivers the gospel 
                to Cornelius, a Gentile and Centurion in the Roman army. <br>
                - Acts 13:46-47 - Paul, quoting Isaiah 49:6, states that he and 
                Barnabas will bring the message of salvation to the Gentiles. 
                <br>
                - Romans 10:11-13 - Paul, quoting Isaiah 28:16, affirms that whoever 
                will call on the name of the Lord will be saved. <br>
                - Romans 10:9-12 - The &quot;root&quot; of Jesse provides hope 
                for the Gentiles <br>
                - Galatians 3:8,14 - Scripture foresees that Gentiles will be 
                justified by faith. In Christ, the promised blessing to Abraham 
                comes to the Gentiles. <br>
                - Ephesians 2:11-18 - Gentiles and Jews united in one body through 
                Christ.<br>
                - Ephesians 3:6-8 - Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members 
                of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, in the book of Revelation 
                we see the multitude praising the Lamb and counting Him worthy 
                to open the book. Why was the Lamb worthy? Because through His 
                blood He paid the price for sin for men from every tribe, tongue, 
                people and nation (Rev. 5:8-10). In addition, two chapters later, 
                John describes a multitude from all nations and tribes before 
                the throne of God worshipping the Lamb (Rev. 7:9-17).</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">From the beginning to the consummation 
                of the age, God desires all nations to hear and take part in the 
                blessing promised to Abraham. God, through His grace, gives Christians 
                the privilege of playing a role in seeing this theme come to fruition.

              <p> <b></b><font face="Arial" size="2">The law that God gave to 
                the nation of Israel through Moses serves several purposes. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">- First, the law of Moses reveals 
                the character of God. Commands in the law begin with the phrase, 
                &quot;I am the LORD your God,&quot; signifying that the commands 
                are rooted in God's character. The common phrase, &quot;be holy 
                as I am holy,&quot; conveys the same point. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Second, the law is given to make 
                clear to Israel how they can experience the blessings of God. 
                As Israel follows the commands of the law they &quot;live and 
                prosper and prolong&quot; their days in the land that God has 
                given them (Deut. 5:33). </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Third, the law points out the sin 
                of the people of Israel. The content of the law, in fact, contains 
                provisions for sacrifices which have to be made because of the 
                people's general uncleanness and specific sin. The prophets use 
                the law as the standard by which to measure the nation. God's 
                judgment comes because of Israel's failure to live up to the law. 
                Conformity to the law would lead to an end of the judgment and 
                the return of blessings. The prophets also speak of a future time 
                when God will at one point provide a sacrifice for the forgiveness 
                of all their sin. Nowhere is this more clear than in Isaiah 52-53 
                where Isaiah speaks of the &quot;servant of the Lord,&quot; who 
                will &quot;sprinkle&quot; the nations and bear the sins of people 
                so as to make them righteous. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the New Testament, we see similar 
                purposes for the law. Part of Jesus' purpose in preaching the 
                law is to restore the holy standard to which God calls His people. 
                The Pharisees had watered down the law, making it superficial 
                and robbing it of its high claims for holiness. Jesus, in his 
                Sermon on the Mount, seeks to expose and correct their misleading 
                teaching. At times, the Pharisees contradict the law by their 
                hypocritical actions (Mt. 15.3-7). Jesus summarizes the law: &quot;Love 
                God and love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; (Matt. 19:19) That 
                is to be the ruling principle which most clearly reflects the 
                character of God and the ethic that is to guide the church. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, the second purpose stated 
                above for the law in the Old Testament no longer applies in the 
                New. Israel had failed to obtain the full blessings of God through 
                obedience to the law. They had proved unfaithful and there was 
                no indication that they would improve given more time. Would God 
                then get rid of the law in order to bless his people? No. &quot;Do 
                not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; 
                I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them,&quot; Jesus 
                said (Mt. 5:17). God cannot change his character. Instead, he 
                provides a way for the righteous requirements of the law to be 
                met in his people. That solution is for Jesus to offer his life 
                as a sin offering, so that sin can be condemned and the requirements 
                of the law can be met by those who are made alive in Christ by 
                the Spirit (Romans 8:3-4). Christ's death is the atonement that 
                God had promised through Isaiah. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lastly, it is revealed in the New 
                Testament that not only was the law given to make to point out 
                sin (Rom 7:7) but also to point people to a way to be freed from 
                sin through forgiveness, that is, to point to Christ. &quot;So 
                the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ...&quot; (Gal. 
                3:24). </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thus we see that the law serves similar 
                purposes in the Old Testament and the New, and that the law was 
                fulfilled in the New as it pointed sinners to its fulfillment 
                in the substitutionary atonement of Christ. </font></p>

              <p> <b></b><font face="Arial" size="2">In the person of David, it 
                becomes clear who &quot;the seed&quot; will be. He will be a king, 
                a descendant of David, and an heir of the promised eternal throne 
                (II Samuel 7:11-16). Thus the promises concerning the seed are 
                inherent in the promise for an eternal kingdom. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The ruler of this kingdom will crush 
                all of his enemies and will be exalted above all other authorities 
                (Psalm 89, 110). Micah reveals that the king will come from Bethlehem 
                and that he will have an eternal destiny. Even as Israel faces 
                exile and is in exile, God affirms that he will be faithful to 
                his promise and that out of the darkness of Israel's sin and consequent 
                judgment, one will come who will fulfill the promise and there 
                will be no end to his rule. Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel 
                clearly point to a future &quot;David&quot; who will completely 
                fulfill God's promises and bring about an eternal kingdom. It 
                is an awesome promise considering the circumstances God had brought 
                through his judgment at that time. God's people are in a foreign 
                land but the promise remains that God will create his own kingdom 
                for his people to inhabit, led by a descendant of David. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The NT begins with the announcement 
                that the kingdom is at hand. John the Baptist first announces 
                this, and as Jesus begins his ministry he reinforces it. &quot;'The 
                time has come,' he said. 'The kingdom of God is near. Repent and 
                believe the good news!'&quot; (Mark 1:15). There is an element 
                of God's kingdom that still lies in the future, but Jesus is also 
                saying that the kingdom is present with him (Mt. 12:28), because 
                the king has arrived. It is the clear teaching of the NT that 
                Jesus is the promised seed, the anointed one who will reign on 
                David's throne forever, the servant, the root, the branch, the 
                Messiah that the prophets have promised. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The NT makes this clear in two ways. 
                First, it records numerous Old Testament passages about the Messiah 
                and demonstrates how Jesus fulfills them. For example, Matthew 
                notes the fact that Jesus can cast out demons fulfills the prophecy 
                in Isaiah 53:4 that the servant of the Lord &quot;took up our 
                infirmities and carried our diseases.&quot; (Mt. 8:16-17) The 
                apostles in the book of Acts make the same sorts of connections 
                as do the writers of the epistles. Second, the NT records the 
                claims, by Jesus, that he is the Christ. Jesus himself points 
                out prophecy that he fulfills (Mt. 22:41-45). He acknowledges 
                before Peter and the High Priest that he is the Christ (Mt. 16:16; 
                Mt. 26:64). Jesus not only identifies himself as the Christ, but 
                he also expounds on the nature of the king and teaches that he 
                is indeed God himself (John 8:58; 10:30). Thus, the revelation 
                of Jesus as the Son of God, the Christ, gives new meaning to the 
                Old Testament's witness through David that &quot;Yours, O LORD, 
                is the kingdom...&quot; (I Chronicles 29:11)</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Just as the Old Testament portrays 
                the promised kingdom as transcending over all other kingdoms so 
                is Christ pictured as above all other spiritual (Col. 2:15) and 
                earthly rulers: &quot;Therefore God exalted him to the highest 
                place and gave him the name that is above every name...&quot; 
                (Phil. 2:9). </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The nature of the Old Testament's 
                portrayal of the kingdom is also consistent with the portrayal 
                in the New. The kingdom will be characterized by peace, justice, 
                and righteousness, according to Isaiah (Isa. 9:6-7). Jesus communicates 
                in his parables about the kingdom that those who do evil will 
                not be there, but only the righteous (Mt. 13). Revelation 21 depicts 
                a similar kingdom. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The NT adds to the Old Testament 
                description of God's eternal kingdom the identity of the king 
                and the fact that the kingdom has come in Jesus and yet still 
                will come in its fullness in the future. </font></p>

              <p> <b></b><font face="Arial" size="2">As described in the Old Testament 
                the &quot;Day of the Lord&quot; will be both the most terrifying 
                and the most glorious day to date - terrible for those who have 
                not obeyed God, and awesome and glorious for those who have God's 
                special favor. The day of the Lord is a future day in which God 
                brings all of his enemies to final defeat and judgment and his 
                people to final prosperity. Generally, it is pictured as judgment 
                with the assumption that the defeat of God's enemies will be good 
                for God's people. Amos, however, alerts his audience&nbsp; that 
                they would stand under the judgment of God if they do not repent 
                (Amos 8). For the faithful, however, there is the promise of a 
                new heavens and a new earth which will endure forever (Isa. 66). 
                Zephaniah and Zechariah indicate that the day of the Lord will 
                involve a sacrifice which will consecrate the people and removal 
                sin (Zeph. 1:7; Zech. 13:1). The day of the Lord will be the end 
                of time in the sense that people's fates will be sealed and the 
                kingdom that stands will endure forever. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The appearance of Jesus adds a new 
                dimension to the day of the Lord. Jesus brings some of the blessings 
                of the day of the Lord, but without the judgment, warning that 
                judgment will occur in the future, in addition to the blessings 
                of the new heavens and the new earth. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Luke 4:18-21 Jesus says that the 
                Spirit of the Lord is on him &quot;to proclaim the year of the 
                Lord's favor&quot; and that the poor will have the good news preached 
                to them, the prisoners will be set free, the blind will see, and 
                the oppressed will be released. These are the blessings of the 
                day of the Lord upon the faithful, and Jesus brings them in his 
                first coming. John 3:17 makes the same point: &quot;For God did 
                not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save 
                the world through him.&quot; The Pentecost in Acts provides more 
                evidence that the blessings of the last days have come. Peter 
                explains the disciples speaking in tongues as a fulfillment of 
                a prophecy in Joel 2:28-32 regarding the last days. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, the judgment that accompanies 
                the day of the Lord is still to come. Jesus and his apostles warn 
                that it will come in the future &quot;like a thief in the night.&quot; 
                (Mt. 24; II Peter 3:10) The New Testament gives a rough blueprint 
                of what must occur before Jesus returns and the day of the Lord 
                is finished (Mt. 24, Mk. 13, Lk. 21, I Thess. 2). Wars, famines, 
                and natural disasters will occur leading up to it. The gospel 
                will be preached to the whole world. The &quot;man of lawlessness&quot; 
                or the &quot;abomination that causes desolation&quot; will appear. 
                Satan will deceive people into following him by performing false 
                miracles. Then, amidst all &quot;the distress of those days,&quot; 
                Christ, &quot;the Son of Man&quot; will appear in the clouds with 
                his angels to gather his people. Then fire will destroy the heavens 
                and earth and God will create a new heavens and a new earth (II 
                Peter 3:13). </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The NT affirms what the Old Testament 
                teaches about the day of the Lord. However, it also reveals that 
                some of the blessings of the day of the Lord are available now 
                through Christ. Furthermore, the NT gives more details regarding 
                the events leading up to the day of the Lord. </font></p>

              <p> <b></b><font face="Arial" size="2">The covenant that God made 
                with Israel through the law of Moses was unsuccessful, failing 
                to produce a covenant people who would faithfully act as &quot;a 
                kingdom of priests and a holy nation&quot; (Ex. 19:6) to represent 
                God. The people of Israel proved, by their repeated disobedience, 
                that they could not faithfully follow the law. But, this covenant 
                did succeed in pointing out the need for a different, new covenant. 
                This new covenant could not depend on the response of people, 
                but would depend alone on the faithfulness of God. As Paul points 
                out in Galatians 3:15-19, God had made a promise to Abraham previous 
                to the establishment of the law, and the law did not nullify that 
                promise. That promise also depended only on the actions of God; 
                Abraham participated in it as an individual through his faith. 
                Ezekiel had made the same point (Ezek. 16:59-60). The promise 
                to Abraham gave rise to all of the previous themes. The new covenant 
                is the vehicle through which all of the promises will be fulfilled. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The new covenant is first alluded 
                to in Isaiah and is expounded upon further primarily in Jeremiah 
                and Ezekiel. In Isaiah 49:8, God promises that he will use his 
                &quot;servant of the LORD&quot; to &quot;make you to be a covenant 
                for the people, to restore the land.&quot; In Isaiah 55, God specifies 
                that this covenant will be his &quot;faithful love promised to 
                David.&quot; In Jeremiah 31:31-34 God promises to make a new covenant, 
                not like the old one that could be broken. Rather, God's law will 
                be in his people's hearts and minds, and everyone will know God 
                for themselves and their sins will be completely forgiven. With 
                this, God will gather his scattered people from everywhere and 
                make a covenant whereby he will never stop doing good to them 
                and they will never turn away from him (Jer. 32:37-40). Ezekiel 
                36:22-28 describes how God will accomplish this miracle. Through 
                cleansing his people from all sin, God will give his people a 
                new heart and put a new spirit in them - God's Spirit which will 
                &quot;move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my 
                laws.&quot; </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thus the New Covenant includes the 
                following provisions for his people in the new heavens and new 
                earth: universal knowledge of God, universal peace, universal 
                material prosperity, God's presence among his people, and universal 
                possession of God's Spirit. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">These stunning promises come during 
                Israel's darkest hour. Israel was exiled. Judah is facing the 
                same fate. But amidst all this failure, God reassures his people 
                that the previous promises will still be fulfilled. God will turn 
                again to a covenant that depends solely on him for its success. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the New Testament, all of these 
                aspects of the New Covenant are reaffirmed and some of them begin 
                to be fulfilled. In Jesus, there is a new mediator for a new and 
                better covenant (Hebrews). Jesus' blood which he shed on the cross 
                seals the covenant (Mt. 26:28). Jesus says he came to bring abundant 
                life (John 10:10), a life that would last forever (John 10:28). 
                This new life will come through being born again of the Spirit 
                (John 3:3). God's Spirit brings new life, and in fact, lives with 
                the believer (John 14:17). The Spirit gives the believer power 
                to live a life that pleases God (Gal 5:22-23) and to be a witness 
                for him (Acts 1:8). The Holy Spirit is presently at work in believers. 
                He is the promise of the New Covenant which will bring all the 
                other promises to fulfillment. God finally has a people in Christ, 
                through the Spirit, who are a &quot;chosen people, a royal priesthood, 
                a holy nation, a people belonging to God, [who] may declare the

                light&quot; (I Peter 3:9). </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Still in the future, the ultimate 
                fulfillment of the New Covenant awaits when Israel will be gathered 
                to God (Romans 11:27) and Christ's victory over Satan and death 
                will be complete. God's people will have imperishable bodies (I 
                Cor. 15:54-55), and will live in a new heavens and a new earth 
                where there will be no more evil and the glory of God will be 
                the only light needed (Rev. 21). </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thus in the New Testament, the New 
                Covenant begins to be fulfilled in the person and work of Christ 
                and the ministry of the Holy Spirit; the final fulfillment of 
                the New Covenant is given more detail. </font></p>

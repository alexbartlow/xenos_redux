          For as many as are of the works of the Law are under a curse; for it 
          is written, &quot;CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO DOES NOT ABIDE BY ALL THINGS 
          WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW, TO PERFORM THEM.&quot;<i> 11 </i>Now 
          that no one is justified by the Law before God is evident; for, &quot;THE 
          RIGHTEOUS MAN SHALL LIVE BY FAITH.&quot;<i> 12 </i>However, the Law 
          is not of faith; on the contrary, &quot;HE WHO PRACTICES THEM SHALL 
          LIVE BY THEM.&quot;<i> 13 </i>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the 
          Law, having become a curse for us-- for it is written, &quot;CURSED 
          IS EVERYONE WHO HANGS ON A TREE&quot;--<i> 14 </i>in order that in Christ 
          Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we 
          might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.<i> 15 </i>Brethren, 
          I speak in terms of human relations: even though it is <i>only </i>a 
          man's covenant, yet when it has been ratified, no one sets it aside 
          or adds conditions to it.<i> 16 </i>Now the promises were spoken to 
          Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, &quot;And to seeds,&quot; 
          as <i>referring </i>to many, but <i>rather </i>to one, &quot;And to 
          your seed,&quot; that is, Christ.<i> 17 </i>What I am saying is this: 
          the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not invalidate 
          a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise.<i> 
          18 </i>For if the inheritance is based on law, it is no longer based 
          on a promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by means of a promise.<i> 
          19 </i>Why the Law then? It was added because of transgressions, having 
          been ordained through angels by the agency of a mediator, until the 
          seed should come to whom the promise had been made.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(<a name="Gal. 3:23-24">Gal. 3:23-24</a>) 
          But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being 
          shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.<i> 24 </i>Therefore 
          the Law has become our tutor <i>to lead us </i>to Christ, that we may 
          be justified by faith.</font></p>

          There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, 
          there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.<i> 
          29 </i>And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's offspring, 
          heirs according to promise.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(<a name="Gal. 4:24">Gal. 4:24</a>) This

          are called &quot;Uncircumcision&quot; by the so-called &quot;Circumcision,&quot; 
          <i>which is </i>performed in the flesh by human hands--<i> 12 remember 
          </i>that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the 
          commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having 
          no hope and without God in the world.<i> 13 </i>But now in Christ Jesus 
          you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood of 
          Christ.<i> 14 </i>For He Himself is our peace, who made both <i>groups 
          into </i>one, and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall,<i> 15 
          </i>by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, <i>which is </i>the Law of 
          commandments <i>contained </i>in ordinances, that in Himself He might 
          make the two into one new man, <i>thus </i>establishing peace,<i> 16 
          </i>and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, 
          by it having put to death the enmity.<i> 17 </i>AND HE CAME AND PREACHED 
          PEACE TO YOU WHO WERE FAR AWAY, AND PEACE TO THOSE WHO WERE NEAR;<i>

          better promises.<i> 7 </i>For if that first <i>covenant </i>had been 
          faultless, there would have been no occasion sought for a second.<i>

          MADE WITH THEIR FATHERS ON THE DAY WHEN I TOOK THEM BY THE HAND TO LEAD

          I WILL BE MERCIFUL TO THEIR INIQUITIES, AND I WILL REMEMBER THEIR SINS

          And they sang^ a new song, saying, &quot;Worthy art Thou to take the 
          book, and to break its seals; for Thou wast slain, and didst purchase 
          for God with Thy blood <i>men </i>from every tribe and tongue and people 
          and nation.<i> 10 </i>&quot;And Thou hast made them <i>to be </i>a kingdom 
          and priests to our God; and they will reign upon the earth.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(<a name="Rev. 6:2-8">Rev. 6:2-8</a>) And 
          I looked, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow; 
          and a crown was given to him; and he went out conquering, and to conquer.<i> 
          3 </i>And when He broke the second seal, I heard the second living creature 
          saying, &quot;Come.&quot;<i> 4 </i>And another, a red horse, went out; 
          and to him who sat on it, it was granted to take peace from the earth, 
          and that <i>men </i>should slay one another; and a great sword was given 
          to him.<i> 5 </i>And when He broke the third seal, I heard the third 
          living creature saying, &quot;Come.&quot; And I looked, and behold, 
          a black horse; and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand.<i> 
          6 </i>And I heard as it were a voice in the center of the four living 
          creatures saying, &quot;A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts 
          of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine.&quot;<i> 
          7 </i>And when He broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth 
          living creature saying, &quot;Come.&quot;<i> 8 </i>And I looked, and 
          behold, an ashen horse; and he who sat on it had the name Death; and 
          Hades was following with him. And authority was given to them over a 
          fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence 
          and by the wild beasts of the earth.</font></p>

          After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude, which no 
          one could count, from every nation and <i>all </i>tribes and peoples 
          and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed 
          in white robes, and palm branches <i>were </i>in their hands;<i> 10 
          </i>and they cry out with a loud voice, saying, &quot;Salvation to our 
          God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb.&quot;<i> 11 </i>And all 
          the angels were standing around the throne and <i>around </i>the elders 
          and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before the 
          throne and worshiped God,<i> 12 </i>saying, &quot;Amen, blessing and 
          glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might, <i>be 
          </i>to our God forever and ever. Amen.&quot;<i> 13 </i>And one of the 
          elders answered, saying to me, &quot;These who are clothed in the white 
          robes, who are they, and from where have they come?&quot;<i> 14 </i>And 
          I said to him, &quot;My lord, you know.&quot; And he said to me, &quot;These 
          are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed 
          their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.<i> 15 </i>&quot;For 
          this reason, they are before the throne of God; and they serve Him day 
          and night in His temple; and He who sits on the throne shall spread 
          His tabernacle over them.<i> 16 </i>&quot;They shall hunger no more, 
          neither thirst anymore; neither shall the sun beat down on them, nor 
          any heat;<i> 17 </i>for the Lamb in the center of the throne shall be 
          their shepherd, and shall guide them to springs of the water of life; 
          and God shall wipe every tear from their eyes.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(<a name="Rev. 11:15">Rev. 11:15</a>) And 
          the seventh angel sounded; and there arose loud voices in heaven, saying, 
          &quot;The kingdom of the world has become <i>the kingdom </i>of our 
          Lord, and of His Christ; and He will reign forever and ever.&quot;</font></p>

          sharp sickle in His hand.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(<a name="Rev. 19:15">Rev. 19:15</a>) And 
          from His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may smite the

        <p><b></b><font face="Arial" size="2">In Genesis 1:28 God blesses Adam 
          and Eve and instructs them to be fruitful and multiply. This theme reappears 
          throughout the Old Testament during times of major transition. After 
          the flood, God blesses Noah and his sons and instructs them to be fruitful 
          and multiply. Jacob receives this promise after fleeing from Esau. In 
          addition, at the time Jacobs's name is changed to Israel, God reminds 
          him he will be a great nation and charges him to be fruitful and multiply. 
          Later while in Egypt, it was the prolific nature and power of the Jewish 
          people that caused the Pharaoh to seek alternatives to curbing their 
          growth. In spite of the persecution at the hands of the Egyptians, God 
          continued to build a nation through which He would deliver the promised 
          seed of Abraham. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Both Jeremiah and Ezekiel speak of this 
          theme in the seventh century. However, they look into the distant future 
          and anticipate a time when the messiah reigns on earth. In Jeremiah 
          23:3, God gathers the Jewish remnant from all the nations. Under the 
          reign of the righteous Branch, they live in peace and continue to multiply. 
          Ezekiel describes this theme as part of the Kingdom Age, when Israel 
          will return to a right relationship with God. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The theme &quot;be fruitful and multiply&quot; 
          includes God's blessing, a blessing not only directed at the nation 
          of Israel, but one that would ultimately apply to all the nations.</font></p>

        <p> <b><font face="Arial" size="2"><a name="Seed">The Seed</a> </font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><span
    style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal">(<a href="otchart2.htm"

        <p> <b></b><font face="Arial" size="2">Immediately after the fall in Genesis 
          3, God pronounces a judgment on Satan that includes a conflict with 
          the woman's seed. The seed will experience a wound on the heel, but 
          will bruise Satan's head. Thus, we have the introduction of the theological 
          theme of the seed. God does not reveal the identity of the seed, only 
          that it is the seed of the woman. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Genesis 22:18, God promises Abraham 
          that through his seed, all the nations of the world will be blessed 
          and vows to work through his descendents, Isaac and Jacob. At the conclusion 
          of Genesis, God reveals that a ruler will come from the tribe of Judah 
          and that his reign will not end (Gen. 49:10). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thousands of years later, God reveals more 
          specifically that the seed will come through a descendent of David. 
          God, speaking through Nathan the prophet, promises David that his descendent 
          will build a house, the temple of God. More importantly, God promises 
          David that he will establish his house and kingdom forever (2 Sam. 7:12-15). 
          David recognized this was a promise that would affect the future of 
          mankind.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As God's plan unfolds the identity of the 
          seed becomes clearer. The promise of a descendent of Abraham, in whom 
          all the nations would be blessed, includes an eternal kingdom and king 
          who will ultimately defeat Satan.</font></p>
        <p align="center"> <b></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="otchart2.htm" target="_self"

        <p> <b><font face="Arial" size="2"><a name="GodPresentWithCovenantPeople">God's 
          presence with His covenant people</a> </font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><span
    style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal">(<a href="otchart2.htm"

        <p> <b></b><font face="Arial" size="2">During the patriarchal era, God 
          assures Jacob and Isaac, &quot;I will be with you&quot; in Genesis 26:3-4 
          and 31:3, respectively. The patriarchs have God's assurance that He 
          will continue to be with them and bless them as they followed his will. 
          However, this promise is merely a precursor to God's dwelling with the 
          whole nation of Israel. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The first hint of this theme is found in 
          Exodus 4:22 during the Mosaic era. As God is preparing Moses to stand 
          before Pharaoh, He refers to Israel as &quot;My son, My first born&quot;. 
          Later in Exodus 29:43-46 we find the clearest reference to this theme 
          in the Old Testament. God commits to tabernacle, or dwell, with His 
          people. This is an incredible theme! The God of the universe dwelt among 
          His chosen people, thus completing a three-part promise to Israel.<sup><a NAME="Ref1"></a><a
    HREF="#Note1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">1. &quot;I will be your God&quot; Gen. 
          17:7-8 <br>
          2. &quot;You will be My people&quot; Exodus 4:22; 6:7 <br>
          3. &quot;I will dwell among you&quot; Exodus 29:43-46 </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This theme continues into the ninth century, 
          when the prophet Joel looks forward to a day when again God will dwell 
          with His people during the millennial kingdom (Joel 3:21). In the eighth 
          century, Isaiah refers to a time when God again will dwell with His 
          people at the first coming of the Messiah (Isaiah 7:14). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While God dwelling with His people is an 
          incredible theme, the ultimate provision is that of His Spirit indwelling 
          the heart of the believer. Ezekiel introduces this theme during the 
          seventh century (Ezek. 37:14). However, before God could dwell among 
          the people, the temple had to be consecrated or purified (Exodus 29:44). 
          In the same way, for God to dwell in the heart of man, a purification 
          process must take place. This, of course, was accomplished through Christ. 
          Christ's death and payment for sin made it possible for God to dwell 
          in the heart of man and is a pledge of our future inheritance (Ephesians 
          1:14-15).</font></p>

        <p> <b></b><font face="Arial" size="2">God charges Abram in Genesis 12:1 
          to leave his country and relatives and go to a new land. Abram left 
          the comfort and security of his home in Ur to follow God's leading. 
          According to Hebrews 11:8-9, he went by faith to a land he did not know, 
          a land he would receive as an inheritance. In addition to receiving 
          the land, God promises Abram that He will bless him, make him a great 
          nation and that through him all the nations on earth will be blessed 
          (Genesis 12:2-3). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With this event, God introduces the theme 
          and promise that Israel, His chosen people, will become a great nation 
          and have a homeland. This is a prominent theme throughout the Mosaic 
          era. God's promises His land (Lev. 25:23) to the Jewish people 69 different 
          times in the book of Deuteronomy alone. He reminds the people that this 
          promise is not new, but one that was made to their fathers (Deuteronomy 
          19:8, 27:3). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Shortly after the Israelites leave Egypt, 
          God summons Moses to Mount Sinai and there promises him that Israel 
          will be a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation (Exodus 19:3-6). God 
          had miraculously protected the Jewish people and allowed them to multiply 
          while in captivity. He delivered them from bondage in Egypt and they 
          are now a nation that is ready to take possession of the land God promised 
          their fathers. However, this was contingent on their ability to follow 
          God's commands. The generation that heard God's promise at Mount Sinai 
          does not take possession of the land because of their disobedience. 
          In spite of this, God did not go back on His promise. Under the leadership 
          of Joshua, the nation of Israel enters the promise land. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This theme continues into the Davidic era 
          and is a component of the covenant God establishes with David. God promises 
          to provide a place for His people where they will experience rest from 
          their enemies. In addition, David's heir will build a house for God. 
          However, more importantly, God will build a house for David and establish 
          his throne forever (2 Sam. 7:11-16, see <u>Eternal Dynasty and Kingdom</u>). 
          After years of unrest and persecution by the other nations, Israel experiences 
          relative peace and prosperity in their own land under the leadership 
          of David. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Later, the nation divides into two kingdoms, 
          Israel to the north with 10 tribes and Judah to the south with 2 tribes. 
          Assyria overtakes Israel and Judah fell captive to Babylon. There appears 
          to be no hope of the Jewish people regaining their status as a nation. 
          However, God speaks through the prophet Ezekiel and promises to revive 
          the nation. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Ezek. 37:12-14) &quot;Therefore prophesy, 
          and say to them, 'Thus says the LORD God, &quot;Behold, I will open 
          your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves, My people; 
          and I will bring you into the land of Israel. {13} &quot;Then you will 
          know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves and caused you 
          to come up out of your graves, My people. {14} &quot;And I will put 
          My Spirit within you, and you will come to life, and I will place you 
          on your own land. Then you will know that I, the LORD, have spoken and 
          done it,&quot; declares the LORD.'&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is not a bodily resurrection, but 
          a national resurrection before the Second Coming of Christ. God follows 
          through on His promise to provide a land and make a nation for His people. 
          In the NT, Stephen and the author of Hebrews recount this promise to 
          Abraham, in Acts 7:4-5 and Hebrews 11:8-9 respectively. They join with 
          the rest of NT authors in looking forward to the hope of a restored 
          nation and land, a nation that experiences not only a political revival 
          but also a spiritual rebirth as described in Ezekiel 37:15-28. </font></p>
        <p align="center"> <b></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="otchart2.htm" target="_self"
    style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12; font-weight: normal"></a><a href="otchart2.htm">return 
          to theme chart</a></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><a name="BlessingToTheWorld">A blessing 
          to the world</a> </b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal">(<a

          to theme chart</a>)</span></font></p>
        <p> <b></b><font face="Arial" size="2">In Genesis 12:3b, God promises 
          Abraham that in him all the families of the earth would be blessed. 
          This blessing is not exclusive to Abraham or to the nation God promises 
          him. It applies to all nations, and tribes (go'wy). Later in Genesis 
          22:17-18 God states that the source of this blessing will be Abraham's 
          seed. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This blessing is first evident when the 
          Israelites leave Egypt. In Exodus 9:20 and 12:38, Moses describes a 
          &quot;mixed multitude&quot; that includes Egyptians who fear God. Throughout 
          the Old Testament, God makes provision for people from other nations 
          who want to know Him, even placing some in very prominent positions.<sup><a NAME="Ref2"></a><a HREF="#Note2">[2]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
          This theme continues in the 9th century with the prophet Joel. He makes 
          it clear, &quot;...whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be delivered...&quot;. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Isaiah 49:5-6, God states that Israel 
          will be a light to the nations and that God's salvation will reach the 
          ends of the earth, not just Israel. In Isaiah 52:15, the Servant suffers 
          vicariously for men's sin, and will &quot;sprinkle many nations&quot;, 
          (go'wy) clearly an allusion to the high priest sprinkling the blood 
          on the mercy seat (Lev. 16:14). The Servant, the seed of Abraham, Jesus 
          Christ, is shown to cover the sins of all mankind. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another example of God's concern for the 
          entire world is seen as He goes to great lengths to bring a prophet 
          to the gentile city of Nineveh. The Ninevites were known enemies of 
          Israel and Jonah is reluctant to preach to these people. His reluctance 
          and lack of compassion for them is evident as he waits, with anticipation, 
          for God to judge and destroy their city. However, the people repent 
          in &quot;sackcloth and ashes&quot; and God withholds judgment of the 
          city, which angers Jonah, (Jonah 3:10-4:1). The book concludes with 
          God expressing His compassion for the people of Nineveh, providing further 
          evidence that God intends the blessing promised to Abraham to apply 
          to all nations. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Jeremiah, Zechariah and Malachi look forward 
          to a time when all the nations (go'wy) of the earth surround the throne 
          of God and worship Him as King.<sup><a
    NAME="Ref3"></a><a HREF="#Note3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp; Clearly, 
          these Old Testament prophets understood God's vision of all nations 
          receiving His message of salvation and blessing. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Therefore, this theme is not unique to 
          the New Testament. God intended to bless the nations from the very beginning. 
          In the New Testament, as in the Old, we see God using human agency to 
          bring the news of His blessing. Christ charges His disciples to go and 
          make disciples of all nations (ethnos) (Matthew 28:18-20; Luke 24:44-49; 
          Acts 1:8). Christ affirms in the Gospel of John that there are other 
          sheep, &quot;not of this fold&quot; who must be brought in under one 
          shepherd (John 10:16). This theme is also prominent after Christ's ministry, 
          through the disciples and Paul:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Acts 8:27-39 - The Ethiopian eunuch receives 
          Christ and is baptized. <br>
          - Acts 10:45 - After a vision from God, Peter delivers the gospel to 
          Cornelius, a Gentile and Centurion in the Roman army. <br>
          - Acts 13:46-47 - Paul quoting Isaiah 49:6 states that he and Barnabas 
          will bring the message of salvation to the Gentiles. <br>
          - Romans 10:11-13 - Paul, quoting Isaiah 28:16, affirms that whoever 
          will call on the name of the Lord will be saved. <br>
          - Romans 10:9-12 - The &quot;root&quot; of Jesse provides hope for the 
          Gentiles <br>
          - Galatians 3:8,14 - Scripture foresees that Gentiles will be justified 
          by faith. In Christ, the promised blessing to Abraham comes to the Gentiles. 
          <br>
          - Ephesians 2:11-18 - Gentiles and Jews united in one body through Christ.<br>
          - Ephesians 3:6-8 - Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members of the 
          body, and fellow partakers of the promise. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, in the book of Revelation we see 
          the multitude praising the Lamb and counting Him worthy to open the 
          book. Why was the Lamb worthy? Because through His blood He paid the 
          price for sin for men from every tribe, tongue, people and nation (Rev. 
          5:8-10). In addition, two chapters later, John describes a multitude 
          from all nations and tribes before the throne of God worshipping the 
          Lamb (Rev. 7:9-17).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">From the beginning to the consummation 
          of the age, God desires all nations to hear and take part in the blessing 
          promised to Abraham. God, through His grace, gives Christians the privilege 
          of playing a role in seeing this theme come to fruition. </font></p>

        <p> <b></b><font face="Arial" size="2">The law that God gave to the nation 
          of Israel through Moses serves several purposes. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">- First, the law of Moses reveals the character 
          of God. Commands in the law begin with the phrase, &quot;I am the LORD 
          your God,&quot; signifying that the commands are rooted in God's character. 
          The common phrase, &quot;be holy as I am holy,&quot; conveys the same 
          point. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Second, the law is given to make clear 
          to Israel how they can experience the blessings of God. As Israel follows 
          the commands of the law they &quot;live and prosper and prolong&quot; 
          their days in the land that God has given them (Deut. 5:33). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Third, the law points out the sin of 
          the people of Israel. The content of the law, in fact, contains provisions 
          for sacrifices which have to be made because of the people's general 
          uncleanness and specific sin. The prophets use the law as the standard 
          by which to measure the nation. God's judgment comes because of Israel's 
          failure to live up to the law. Conformity to the law would lead to an 
          end of the judgment and the return of blessings. The prophets also speak 
          of a future time when God will at one point provide a sacrifice for 
          the forgiveness of all their sin. Nowhere is this more clear than in 
          Isaiah 52-53 where Isaiah speaks of the &quot;servant of the Lord,&quot; 
          who will &quot;sprinkle&quot; the nations and bear the sins of people 
          so as to make them righteous. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the New Testament, we see similar purposes 
          for the law. Part of Jesus' purpose in preaching the law is to restore 
          the holy standard to which God calls His people. The Pharisees had watered 
          down the law, making it superficial and robbing it of its high claims 
          for holiness. Jesus, in his Sermon on the Mount, seeks to expose and 
          correct their misleading teaching. At times, the Pharisees contradict 
          the law by their hypocritical actions (Mt. 15.3-7). Jesus summarizes 
          the law: &quot;Love God and love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; (Matt. 
          19:19) That is to be the ruling principle which most clearly reflects 
          the character of God and the ethic that is to guide the church. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, the second purpose stated above 
          for the law in the Old Testament no longer applies in the New. Israel 
          had failed to obtain the full blessings of God through obedience to 
          the law. They had proved unfaithful and there was no indication that 
          they would improve given more time. Would God then get rid of the law 
          in order to bless his people? No. &quot;Do not think that I have come 
          to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them 
          but to fulfill them,&quot; Jesus said (Mt. 5:17). God cannot change 
          his character. Instead, he would provides a way for the righteous requirements 
          of the law to be met in his people. That solution is for Jesus to offer 
          his life as a sin offering, so that sin can be condemned and the requirements 
          of the law can be met by those who are made alive in Christ by the Spirit 
          (Romans 8:3-4). Christ's death is the atonement that God had promised 
          through Isaiah. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lastly, it is revealed in the New Testament 
          that not only was the law given to make to point out sin (Rom 7:7) but 
          also to point people to a way to be freed from sin through forgiveness, 
          that is, to point to Christ. &quot;So the law was put in charge to lead 
          us to Christ...&quot; (Gal. 3:24). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thus we see that the law serves similar 
          purposes in the Old Testament and the New, and that the law was fulfilled 
          in the New as it pointed sinners to its fulfillment in the substitutionary 
          atonement of Christ. </font></p>

        <p> <b></b><font face="Arial" size="2">In the person of David, it becomes 
          clear who &quot;the seed&quot; will be. He will be a king, a descendant 
          of David, and an heir of the promised eternal throne (II Samuel 7:11-16). 
          Thus the promises concerning the seed are inherent in the promise for 
          an eternal kingdom. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The ruler of this kingdom will crush all 
          of his enemies and will exalted above all other authorities (Psalm 89, 
          110). Micah reveals that the king will come from Bethlehem and that 
          he will have an eternal destiny. Even as Israel faces exile and is in 
          exile, God affirms that he will be faithful to his promise and that 
          out of the darkness of Israel's sin and consequent judgment, one will 
          come who will fulfill the promise, and there will be no end to his rule. 
          Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel clearly point to a future &quot;David&quot; 
          who will completely fulfill God's promises and bring about an eternal 
          kingdom. It is an awesome promise considering the circumstances God 
          had brought through his judgment at that time. God's people are in a 
          foreign land but the promise remains that God will create his own kingdom 
          for his people to dwell, led by a descendant of David. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The NT begins with the announcement that 
          the kingdom is at hand. John the Baptist first announces this, and as 
          Jesus begins his ministry he reinforces it. &quot;'The time has come,' 
          he said. 'The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!'&quot; 
          (Mark 1:15). There is an element of God's kingdom that still lies in 
          the future, but Jesus is also saying that the kingdom is present with 
          him (Mt. 12:28), because the king has arrived. It is the clear teaching 
          of the NT that Jesus is the promised seed, the anointed one who will 
          reign on David's throne forever, the servant, the root, the branch, 
          the messiah that the prophets have promised. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The NT makes this clear in two ways. First, 
          it records numerous Old Testament passages about the messiah and demonstrates 
          how Jesus fulfills them. For example, Matthew notes the fact that Jesus 
          can cast out demons fulfills the prophecy in Isaiah 53:4 that the servant 
          of the Lord &quot;took up our infirmities and carried our diseases.&quot; 
          (Mt. 8:16-17) The apostles in the book of Acts make the same sorts of 
          connections as do the writers of the epistles. Second, the NT records 
          the claims, by Jesus, that he is the Christ. Jesus himself points out 
          prophecy that he fulfills (Mt. 22:41-45). He acknowledges before Peter 
          and the High Priest that he is the Christ (Mt. 16:16; Mt. 26:64). Jesus 
          not only identifies himself as the Christ, but ha also expounds on the 
          nature of the king and teaches that he is indeed God himself (John 8:58; 
          10:30). Thus, the revelation of Jesus as the Son of God, the Christ 
          gives new meaning to the Old Testament's witness through David that 
          &quot;Yours, O LORD, is the kingdom...&quot; (I Chronicles 29:11)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Just as the Old Testament portrays the 
          promised kingdom as transcending over all other kingdoms so is Christ 
          pictured as above all other spiritual (Col. 2:15) and earthly rulers: 
          &quot;Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the 
          name that is above every name...&quot; (Phil. 2:9). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The nature of the Old Testament's portrayal 
          of the kingdom is also consistent with the portrayal in the New. The 
          kingdom will be characterized by peace, justice, and righteousness, 
          according to Isaiah (Isa. 9:6-7). Jesus communicates in his parables 
          about the kingdom that those who do evil will not be there, but only 
          the righteous (Mt. 13). Revelation 21 depicts a similar kingdom. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The NT adds to the Old Testament description 
          of God's eternal kingdom the identity of the king and the fact that 
          the kingdom has come in Jesus and yet still will come in its fullness 
          in the future. </font></p>

        <p> <b></b><font face="Arial" size="2">As described in the Old Testament 
          the &quot;Day of the Lord&quot; will be both the most terrifying and 
          the most glorious day to date - terrible for those who have not obeyed 
          God, and awesome and glorious for those who have God's special favor. 
          The day of the Lord is a future day in which God brings all of his enemies 
          to final defeat and judgment and his people to final prosperity. Generally, 
          it is pictured as judgment with the assumption that the defeat of God's 
          enemies will be good for God's people. Amos, however, alerts his audience&nbsp; 
          that they would stand under the judgment of God if they do not repent 
          (Amos 8). For the faithful, however, there is the promise of a new heavens 
          and a new earth which will endure forever (Isa. 66). Zephaniah and Zechariah 
          indicate that the day of the Lord will involve a sacrifice which will 
          consecrate the people and the removal of sin (Zeph. 1:7; Zech. 13:1). 
          The day of the Lord will be the end of time in the sense that people's 
          fates will be sealed and the kingdom that stands will endure forever. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The appearance of Jesus adds a new dimension 
          to the day of the Lord. Jesus brings some of the blessings of the day 
          of the Lord, but without the judgment, warning that judgment would occur 
          in the future, in addition to the blessings of the new heavens and the 
          new earth. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Luke 4:18-21 Jesus says that the Spirit 
          of the Lord is on him &quot;to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor&quot; 
          and that the poor will have the good news preached to them, the prisoners 
          will be set free, the blind will see, and the oppressed will be released. 
          These are the blessings of the day of the Lord upon the faithfu, and 
          Jesus brings them in his first coming. John 3:17 makes the same point: 
          &quot;For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, 
          but to save the world through him.&quot; The Pentecost in Acts provides 
          more evidence that the blessings of the last days have come. Peter explains 
          the disciples speaking in tongues as a fulfillment of a prophecy in 
          Joel 2:28-32 regarding the last days. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, the judgment that accompanies 
          the day of the Lord is still to come. Jesus and his apostles warn that 
          it will come in the future &quot;like a thief in the night.&quot; (Mt. 
          24; II Peter 3:10) The New Testament gives a rough blueprint of what 
          must occur before Jesus returns and the day of the Lord is finished 
          (Mt. 24, Mk. 13, Lk. 21, I Thess. 2). Wars, famines, and natural disasters 
          will occur leading up to it. The gospel will be preached to the whole 
          world. The &quot;man of lawlessness&quot; or the &quot;abomination that 
          causes desolation&quot; will appear. Satan will deceive people into 
          following him by performing false miracles. Then, amidst all &quot;the 
          distress of those days,&quot; Christ, &quot;the Son of Man&quot; will 
          appear in the clouds with his angels to gather his people. Then fire 
          will destroy the heavens and earth and God will create a new heavens 
          and a new earth (II Peter 3:13). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The NT affirms what the Old Testament teaches 
          about the day of the Lord. However, it also reveals that some of the 
          blessings of the day of the Lord are available now through Christ. Furthermore, 
          the NT gives more details regarding the events leading up to the day 
          of the Lord. </font></p>

        <p> <b></b><font face="Arial" size="2">The covenant that God made with 
          Israel through the law of Moses, was unsuccessful, failing to produce 
          a covenant people who would faithfully act as &quot;a kingdom of priests 
          and a holy nation&quot; (Ex. 19:6) to represent God. The people of Israel 
          proved, by their repeated disobedience, that they could not faithfully 
          follow the law. But, this covenant did succeed in pointing out the need 
          for a different, new covenant. This new covenant could not depend on 
          the response of people, but would depend alone on the faithfulness of 
          God. As Paul points out in Galatians 3:15-19, God had made a promise 
          to Abraham previous to the establishment of the law, and the law did 
          not nullify that promise. That promise also depended only on the actions 
          of God; Abraham participated in it as an individual through his faith. 
          Ezekiel had made the same point (Ezek. 16:59-60). The promise to Abraham 
          gave rise to all of the previous themes. The new covenant is the vehicle 
          through which all of the promises will be fulfilled. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The new covenant is first alluded to in 
          Isaiah and is expounded upon further primarily in Jeremiah and Ezekiel. 
          In Isaiah 49:8, God promises that he will use his &quot;servant of the 
          LORD&quot; to &quot;make you to be a covenant for the people, to restore 
          the land.&quot; In Isaiah 55, God specifies that this covenant will 
          be his &quot;faithful love promised to David.&quot; In Jeremiah 31:31-34 
          God promises to make a new covenant, not like the old one that could 
          be broken. Rather, God's law will be in his people's hearts and minds, 
          and everyone will know God for themselves and their sins will be completely 
          forgiven. With this, God will gather his scattered people from everywhere 
          and make a covenant whereby he will never stop doing good to them and 
          they will never turn away from him (Jer. 32:37-40). Ezekiel 36:22-28 
          describes how God will accomplish this miracle. Through cleansing his 
          people from all sin, God will give his people a new heart and put a 
          new spirit in them - God's Spirit which will &quot;move you to follow 
          my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thus the New Covenant includes the following 
          provisions for his people in the new heavens and new earth: universal 
          knowledge of God, universal peace, universal material prosperity, God's 
          presence among his people, and universal possession of God's Spirit. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">These stunning promises come during Israel's 
          darkest hour. Israel was exiled. Judah is facing the same fate. But 
          amidst all this failure, God reassures his people that the previous 
          promises will still be fulfilled. God will turn again to a covenant 
          that depends solely on him for its success. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the New Testament, all of these aspects 
          of the New Covenant are reaffirmed and some of them begin to be fulfilled. 
          In Jesus, there is a new mediator for a new and better covenant (Hebrews). 
          Jesus' blood which he shed on the cross seals the covenant (Mt. 26:28). 
          Jesus says he came to bring abundant life (John 10:10), a life that 
          would last forever (John 10:28). This new life will come through being 
          born again of the Spirit (John 3:3). God's Spirit brings new life, and 
          in fact, lives with the believer (John 14:17). The Spirit gives the 
          believer power to live a life that pleases God (Gal 5:22-23) and to 
          be a witness for him (Acts 1:8). The Holy Spirit is presently at work 
          in believers. He is the promise of the New Covenant which will bring 
          all the other promises to fulfillment. God finally has a people in Christ, 
          through the Spirit, who are a &quot;chosen people, a royal priesthood, 
          a holy nation, a people belonging to God, [who] may declare the praises 
          of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.&quot; 
          (I Peter 3:9). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Still in the future, the ultimate fulfillment 
          of the New Covenant awaits when Israel will be gathered to God (Romans 
          11:27) and Christ's victory over Satan and death will be complete. God's 
          people will have imperishable bodies (I Cor. 15:54-55), and will live 
          in a new heavens and a new earth where there will be no more evil and 
          the glory of God will be the only light needed (Rev. 21). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thus in the New Testament, the New Covenant 
          begins to be fulfilled in the person and work of Christ and the ministry 
          of the Holy Spirit; the final fulfillment of the New Covenant is given 
          more detail. </font></p>

            is the process of becoming more like Christ in our conduct and character. 
            But how does it occur? What disciplines, habits, and ways of thinking 
            and living do Christians need to cultivate to become &quot;sanctified&quot;? 
            In <em>Five Views on Sanctification</em><a name="ref1"></a><sup><a href="#Note1">[1]</a></sup>, 
            Protestant theologians explore these questions and share their understanding 
            of how sanctification occurs. In this paper, I will summarize and 
            react to each contributor's view of sanctification.&nbsp; At the end 
            of the paper, I will offer my own explanation of how sanctification 
            occurs. I hope you enjoy it! </font>

            Wesleyan View - presented by Melvin Dieter</a> <br>
            </b>This view derives its name from John Wesley (1703-1791), an English 
            theologian and evangelist. Wesley was a student of the writings of 
            the early church fathers. Their influence set Wesley's beliefs apart 
            from the dominant Reformed tradition of his day. </font>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For Wesley, the ultimate goal of sanctification 
              was &quot;to renew men's and women's hearts in (God's) image.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref2"></a><a href="#Note2">[2]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              Wesley worked out this definition of sanctification in a practical 
              way. He believed that true Christian maturity was primarily evidenced 
              by &quot;'a faith that works by divine love in the crucible of everyday 
              life.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref3"></a><a href="#Note3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dieter shares Wesley's belief that 
              love is the true measure of sanctification. While acknowledging 
              that the primary meaning of &quot;sanctify&quot; in the Old Testament 
              is &quot;to set apart to God,&quot; Dieter claims that the New Testament 
              word strongly emphasizes the ethical. Love, he says, is the true 
            test of holiness. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Wesley taught that sanctification begins 
              at conversion, when the Spirit regenerates the heart of the believer, 
              and that it's appropriated by faith, the same way that salvation 
              is. Sanctification is &quot;faith working by love&quot;: not merited 
              but appropriated by faith. When a Christian appeals to God in faith 
              for the power to live a life of Godly love, the Holy Spirit takes 
              away his or her &quot;bent to sin&quot; and replaces it with a &quot;bent 
              to loving obedience.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref4"></a><a href="#Note4">[4]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Original Sin and Prevenient Grace 
              </em><br>
              Wesley believed that fallen man is utterly depraved and that any 
              movement toward God should be attributed to prevenient, or antecedent, 
              grace - the work of God in drawing all men to himself. The law written 
              on the Gentiles' hearts, their inner moral compass, is a product 
              of the prevenient grace of God extending itself to man and drawing 
              him to Himself. Prevenient grace is the initial and necessary agent 
              in the process of salvation. It is &quot;the beginning of the process 
              by which God begins to lighten the darkness of the Fall for all 
              men and women; it will bring those who faithfully receive it to 
              saving grace, sanctifying grace, and grace for the life of love.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref5"></a><a href="#Note5">[5]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Perfection </em><br>
              Can a Christian lead a sinless life? Wesley taught that mature Christians 
              will always be capable of falling into sin but they need not necessarily 
              do so. Christians are free from the dominion of sin and can choose 
              against it. But because we live in a fallen world dominated by sin 
              and its effects, we will have to wait for total delivery from the 
            presence of sin until the life to come. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Wesley admitted there is always room 
              for a Christian to develop in maturity. But he believed that Christians 
              can enjoy greater degree of freedom from sin than Reformed theologians 
              thought possible. He went as far as to assert that Christians can 
              be delivered from willful sin<sup><a name="Ref6"></a><a href="#Note6">[6]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              and that this level of sanctification can occur before death<sup><a name="Ref7"></a><a href="#Note7">[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;. 
              For this reason, Wesley often said that Christians should not be 
              &quot;content with any religion which does not imply the destruction 
              of all the works of the devil, that is, of all sin.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref8"></a><a href="#Note8">[8]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              We can fulfill God's law of love in this life, despite all the failings 
              and imperfections of the world. This is what Wesley calls the &quot;optimism 
            of grace.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Wesley's understanding of sin in the 
              life of a believer is seen most clearly in his doctrine of entire 
              sanctification. Dieter defines entire sanctification as &quot;a 
              personal, definitive work of God's sanctifying grace by which the 
              war within oneself might cease and the heart might be released from 
              rebellion into whole hearted love for God and others.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref9"></a><a href="#Note9">[9]</a></sup> 
              &nbsp; Entire sanctification can occur at the moment of salvation 
              but typically occurs during a crisis point in the life of a Christian 
              sometime after conversion. Those who have experienced entire sanctification 
            are characterized by: </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">- a wholehearted love for God and neighbor 
              <br>
              - having the mind of Christ <br>
              - bearing the fruit of the Spirit <br>
              - both inward and outward righteousness and true holiness in life 
              <br>
              - complete devotion to God <br>
              - giving thoughts, words, and actions as a sacrifice of thanksgiving 
              to God <br>
              - salvation from all sin <sup><a name="Ref10"></a><a href="#Note10">[10]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Entire sanctification involves freedom 
              from willful sin, but it is not the final destination of Christian 
              growth. Dieter says, &quot;the idea of a gradual progression in 
              sanctification is extended beyond the boundaries of this life, even 
              though the basic relationship that nourishes such development is 
              established in the crisis moment of entire sanctification.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref11"></a><a href="#Note11">[11]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dieter also believes that the Reformation 
              tradition, with its emphasis on imputed righteousness, neglects 
              Paul's teaching that existential deliverance from sin is available 
              in Christ. Since the life of Jesus is being revealed in them, Christians 
              should &quot;not let sin reign in their mortal bodies.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref12"></a><a href="#Note12">[12]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              They have been &quot;set free from sin and have become slaves to 
              God.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref13"></a><a href="#Note13">[13]</a></sup> 
              &nbsp; For Wesley and his followers, then, any view of sanctification 
              that doesn't hold out the possibility of real, experiential deliverance 
            from sin in this life falls short of the full Gospel. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>The law </em><br>
              Wesley taught that Christians who follow the &quot;royal law&quot; 
              of the Sermon on the Mount are fulfilling the ten commandments and 
              the requirements of the law. He believed, &quot;the ten commandments 
              are renewed in the Sermon on the Mount in their sanctifying purity 
              and spirituality and... describe the life of practical Christian 
              holiness, which is the end of faith and the commandments.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref14"></a><a href="#Note14">[14]</a></sup> 
              &nbsp; Wesley also said that faith establishes the practice of the 
              law in the life of the believer. The result of this faith is holiness 
            expressed by love for God and neighbor. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Wesley disagreed with the notion that 
              Christians are free from their obligation to keep the law. Dieter 
              disagrees. He believed that &quot;freedom,&quot; when used in conjunction 
              with the law, was not freedom from obligation to keep it, but rather 
              freedom to love and serve God. The Christian is still under &quot;obligation 
              to fulfill the law on the basis of faith.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref15"></a><a href="#Note15">[15]</a></sup> 
            &nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>The Holy Spirit </em><br>
              Wesley tied the ministry of the Holy Spirit to promises throughout 
              the Bible (Duet. 30; Jer. 31; Ezek. 36) that God will give His people 
              the ability to truly love God, to keep His statutes, and to obey 
              Him. As a result of the Spirit's empowering, true believers (the 
              people of God) will be &quot;enabled to live in righteousness and 
              true holiness all their lives.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref16"></a><a href="#Note16">[16]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              God demands perfection and makes provision for it through the Holy 
            Spirit. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><a name="Reaction to the Wesleyan view">Reaction 
              to the Wesleyan View</a> <br>
              </b>Dieter does not directly discuss Wesley's teaching on the sin 
              nature. At first glance, he seems to affirm that the sin nature 
            is still operative within the life of a Christian: </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&quot;The presence of Christ 
              and the freedom from the rebellious nature of the old Adam in the 
              Christian's life in the Spirit, however, are not the final release 
              from the presence and threat of sin. Its power and presence threaten 
              and tempt us through our fallen bodies and minds as well as in all 
              that surrounds us in a world that is yet to be redeemed.&quot;</font><font face="Arial" size="1"><sup><a name="Ref17"></a><a href="#Note17">[17]</a></sup> 
            &nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But what is the source of the temptation? 
              Dieter and Wesley imply that the temptation to sin doesn't come 
            from within but rather from the fallen world around us: </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&quot;After declaring freedom 
              from the dominion and inner presence of sin in the life of the Spirit-filled 
              Christian (Rom. 8:1-17), he (Wesley) nevertheless acknowledges that 
              we still live in a fallen, sinful world...&quot;</font><font face="Arial" size="1"><sup><a name="Ref18"></a><a href="#Note18">[18]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dieter grants that the flesh is a source 
              of temptation (Matt. 26:41) but doesn't give a well-developed explanation 
              of the role of the sin nature in the life of the believer. Dieter's 
              essay leaves the reader uncertain about the Wesleyan position on 
            this important issue. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In The John Wesley Reader, a compilation 
              of Wesley's sermon notes and journal entries, Wesley translates 
              Rom. 6:6 as &quot;Our old man is crucified with Christ, that the 
              body of sin might be destroyed (katargeo), that henceforth we should 
              not serve sin.&quot; Translating katargeo as &quot;destroyed&quot; 
              is consistent with Wesley's belief in the removal of the sin nature. 
              This is confirmed&nbsp; when he adds, &quot;an immediate fruit of 
              this faith... is power over sin... for it purifies the heart from 
              every unholy desire and temper.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref19"></a><a href="#Note19">[19]</a></sup> 
            &nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Wesley minimized the role of the sin 
              nature in the life of the believer and the conflict it causes within. 
              This conclusion is also supported by the Wesleyan doctrine of entire 
            sanctification. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Entire sanctification is an important 
              doctrine in Wesleyan theology. It offers the hope that Christians 
              are able to live without sin during their lives on Earth.<sup><a name="Ref20"></a><a href="#Note20">[20]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              But this claim doesn't account for numerous New Testament texts 
              which describe a struggle between the flesh and the spirit. In Galatians 
              5:17, Paul describes struggling against the sinful tendencies of 
              our flesh as if it were a normative part of the Christian experience. 
              In Romans 7:18 Paul says, &quot;the wishing (of doing good) is present 
              in me, but the doing of the good is not.&quot; How does the doctrine 
              of entire sanctification explain how statements like these can come 
            from a mature Christian? </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dieter cites Matt 5:48 as proof that 
              it is possible to live free of willful sin. In this passage, Jesus 
              tells his listeners that their current standard of righteousness 
              is not good enough to satisfy God, saying, &quot;you are to be perfect, 
              as your heavenly Father is perfect.&quot; As long as they insist 
              on approaching God by their works, the standard they'll be measured 
              by is perfection. But perfection was not a state Jesus expected 
              his audience to reach in this life. If it was, why did he model 
              a prayer for his disciples in which he said, &quot;forgive us our 
              trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us&quot;? His 
              prayer clearly implies that Christians can and will sin from time 
              to time. Dieter also quotes Colossians 1:28, in which Paul expresses 
              his wish to &quot;present every man perfect (teleios) in Christ.&quot; 
              But does teleios mean &quot;morally perfect&quot; in this verse? 
              Probably not. Many commentators translate teleios in Colossians 
              1 as &quot;mature.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref21"></a><a href="#Note21">[21]</a></sup> 
              Equating sinless perfection with teleios in Colossians 1 contradicts 
              other verses that teach Christians continue to sin. For example, 
              in 1 John 2:1, John assures his Christian listeners, &quot;I am 
              writing these things to you that you may not sin. And if anyone 
              sins, we have an advocate with the Father.&quot; Instead of insisting 
              that Christians achieve sinless perfection in this life, 1 Thessalonians 
              5:23-24 suggests that human perfection is a future event that God 
            will accomplish at the second coming of Christ. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I still can't forget the words of Oswald 
              Sanders<sup><a name="Ref22"></a><a href="#Note22">[22]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              when I heard him speak a few years ago. This 88 year-old mature 
              Christian worker who had spend a lifetime following Christ said, 
              &quot;the older I get, the more deeply I am aware of how sinful 
              I am.&quot; This has certainly been my experience and the experience 
              of countless other Christians who have wrestled with the issue of 
            sin in their lives. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Wesley's doctrine of entire sanctification 
              leans heavily on his vague definition of sin. He believed that a 
              Christian who has experienced entire sanctification enjoys freedom 
              from deliberate sins.<sup><a name="Ref23"></a><a href="#Note23">[23]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              Slip-ups in behavior can still occur, but these result from living 
              in a fallen world. Wesley called these lapses &quot;mistakes.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref24"></a><a href="#Note24">[24]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              He said, &quot;because we are imperfect persons in an imperfect 
              world, perfection 'in love' is consistent with a 'thousand mistakes.' 
              But limited as we are by our own and the world's imperfections, 
              we may still enjoy a relationship in which, through the power of 
              the Holy Spirit, we can fulfill the great and final commandment 
              of loving God with our whole heart...&quot;<sup><a name="Ref25"></a><a href="#Note25">[25]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">By creating the categories of willful 
              sin and &quot;mistakes,&quot; Wesley erodes a broader definition 
              of sin found in Romans 14:23: &quot;whatever is not from faith is 
              sin.&quot; The Bible portrays sin as any action, deed, or thought 
              that falls short of God's perfect character (Rom. 3:23). This is 
              clear from Jesus' repeated contrasts, &quot;you have heard... but 
              I say to you,&quot;&nbsp; in the Sermon on the Mount. By equating 
              murder with anger and lust with adultery, Jesus is trying to expose 
              the superficial, shallow view of sin held by his audience. Wesley's 
              attempt to separate &quot;sins&quot; from &quot;mistakes&quot; misses 
              the all-inclusive spirit of these and other New Testament passages.

              and enables us to live lives that are pleasing to Him.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref26"></a><a href="#Note26">[26]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              When we are justified, our guilt before God is removed. Sanctification 
              is the process of removing the corruption caused by sin polluting 
              our lives. This is consistent with the meaning of the Greek word 
              for sanctify, hagiadzo. Hagiadzo literally means to make holy: to 
              be set apart for service to God and to abandon practices that displease 
            Him. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>How sanctification occurs </em><br>
              Hoekema says there are three essential requirements for sanctification. 
              First, sanctification can only occur in the context of a growing 
              union with Christ. We will not grow unless we are identified with 
              Christ. Second, he points out that we are sanctified by the truth. 
              The Bible is &quot;one of the chief means whereby God sanctifies 
              His people.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref27"></a><a href="#Note27">[27]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              Lastly, faith is the means by which we appropriate our sanctification. 
              Faith helps us to live in union with Christ, accept the fact that 
              we are no longer mastered by sin, and results in the production 
              of fruit in the life of the Christian. Like justification, sanctification 
            comes by faith. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>The goal of sanctification </em><br>
              What is the process of sanctification accomplishing in the life 
              of a Christian? Hoekema distinguishes between two end results: the 
              proximate and final goals of sanctification. The final end of our 
              sanctification is the glorification of God. This is implied by Paul's 
              use of the phrase, &quot;to the praise of his Glory&quot; in Ephesians 
              1:12. The proximate goal of sanctification is our perfection: God's 
              desire that every Christian be conformed to the likeness of Christ 
              (1 John 3:2; 1 Corinthians 15:49; Ephesians 5:27; Hebrews 12:23). 
              As a result of being conformed to His image, Christians share in 
              Christ's glorification and become an eternal testimony to His glory. 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>God's role and man's role in sanctification 
              </em><br>
              To reach this goal, both man and God play a part. God set our sanctification 
              in motion by electing us for conformity to Him and scripture indicates 
              that all three persons of the trinity are involved. We read, for 
              example, that the Father disciplines us and sanctifies us by the 
              truth (Heb. 12:10; John 17:17), the Son cleanses the church through 
              the word (Eph. 5:25-27), and the Holy Spirit is responsible for 
              our washing, rebirth and renewal (Titus 3:5). The role, or roles, 
              that each member of the Godhead plays in sanctification are not 
              compartmentalized; &quot;sanctification (is) ascribed to the triune 
              God without any designation of persons.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref28"></a><a href="#Note28">[28]</a></sup> 
            &nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Sanctification is accomplished by God, 
              but it still requires the cooperation of men and women. We must 
              fight against sin, express gratitude toward God, and offer ourselves 
              fully to him. We also should imitate the example of Christ (Phil. 
            2:5-7; John 13:14-15). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The interplay between man's role and 
              God's role in conforming us to Christ is seen clearly in passages 
              like Philippians 2:12-13: &quot;(you) work out your 
              salvation in fear and trembling.... for it is God at who is at work 
              in you to will and work for his good pleasure...&quot; But Hoekema 
              carefully points out that the relationship between our work and 
              God's work shouldn't be thought of strictly in terms of cooperation. 
              Instead, he follows John Murray who said, &quot;God's working in 
              us is not suspended because we work, nor our working suspended because 
              God works... the relation is that because God works we work.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref29"></a><a href="#Note29">[29]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Definitive and progressive sanctification 
              </em><br>
              Reformed theologians claim that scripture speaks about sanctification 
              in two ways: as an ongoing process and as an accomplished event. 
              The latter use can be seen in 1 Corinthians 1:2 and 6:11. In 1 Corinthians 
              1:2, believers are spoken of as &quot;those who have been sanctified 
              in Christ Jesus.&quot; In 1 Corinthians 6:11, Paul says the Corinthians 
              &quot;were sanctified.&quot; The Greek word for sanctify in 6:11, 
              hagiadzo, is used by Paul in the aorist tense to emphasize that 
              the Corinthian's sanctification is a past, completed action. This 
              statement, made to an audience that could hardly be called mature, 
              implies that Christians are somehow sanctified in a way that has 
              no bearing on the condition of their day-to-day life. Hoekema calls 
            this use of hagiadzo &quot;definitive sanctification.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Romans 6, the passage with the most 
              detail about definitive sanctification, teaches that Christians 
            have been: </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(1) freed from the power of sin <br>
              (2) enabled to live in newness of life under the reign of grace 
              <br>
              (3) unified with Christ in his resurrection <br>
            (4) made new creatures </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Definitive sanctification differs from 
              Wesley's notion of entire sanctification in two important ways. 
              First, definitive sanctification does not produce sinless perfection 
              in the Christian. Hoekema asserts that Christians will always &quot;struggle 
              against sin and sometimes fall into sin.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref30"></a><a href="#Note30">[30]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              A true believer is genuinely a new creature, but they are not fully 
              transformed into Christ's image. Second, definitive sanctification 
              does not occur in an experience subsequent to salvation but rather 
            coincides with it. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Other passages describe what Hoekema 
              calls &quot;progressive sanctification.&quot; They imply that sin 
              continues to be present to some extent in the life of the believer 
              (1 Kings 8:46; Psalm 19:12; Psalm 143:2; Proverbs 20:9; Isaiah 64:6; 
              James 3:2). According to Paul, sin is dealt with over time by putting 
              to death the deeds of the flesh (see Romans 8:13). Progression in 
              sanctification can also be seen in Colossians 3. Verses 1 and 3 
              affirm that definitive sanctification has occurred (&quot;we have 
              died in Christ and been raised up with him&quot;) but, in verse 
              5, Paul advises one must still &quot;consider the members of your 
              earthly body to be dead to sin.&quot; Colossians 3:9-10, 2 Corinthians 
              7:1 and 2 Corinthians 3:18 all convey this same progressive sense 
            of sanctification. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Reflecting on these two types of sanctification, 
              Hoekema concludes, &quot;One could think of definitive sanctification 
              as the beginning of the process and of progressive sanctification 
              as the continual maturing of the new person who was created by definitive 
              sanctification.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref31"></a><a href="#Note31">[31]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Old self and new self</em><br>
              Reformed theologians have differed over the presence of the old 
              and new self in the life of the believer. Standing with Murray, 
              Hoekema believes that Christians are &quot;no longer the old selves 
              they once were. They are not, as has often been taught, both old 
              selves and new selves but are indeed new selves in Christ.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref32"></a><a href="#Note32">[32]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            He makes his case by citing: </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(1) the crucifixion of the old self 
              in Romans 6:6 <br>
              (2) the use of the aorist tense in Colossians 3:9-10 to describe 
              how Christians have taken off their old self and put on their new 
              self <br>
              (3) the New International Version's rendition of Ephesians 4:20-24 
              which implies that the old self was put off when we came to know 
            Christ </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Christians are new creatures - not 
              sinless, nor totally conformed to the image of Christ, but genuinely 
              new people headed in that direction. This is why we are still repeatedly 
              urged in the New Testament to fight sin and the influence of evil 
              in our lives (Ephesians 6:11-13; Galatians 5:16; Hebrews 12:4). 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Reformed theology and perfectionism</em><br>
              Hoekema advances several reasons why the Wesleyan hope of living 
            a life without sin is flawed: </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(1) The hope of perfection requires 
              a weakening of the definition of sin (e.g. only deliberate sins). 
              <br>
              (2) The Wesleyan goal of perfection in this life is admitted to 
              be less perfect than our eschatological perfection. <br>
              (3) The Bible doesn't encourage believers to seek a 'second experience' 
              like entire sanctification that follows conversion; the emphasis 
              is on pursuing ongoing growth (Rom. 12:2; Col. 3:10; Eph. 4:23; 
              2 Pet. 3:18). <br>
              (4) Many passages in the Bible indicate that Christians still sin 
              (Matt. 6:12; James 3:2, etc.). <br>
              (5) Gal. 5:16-17 indicates that an internal&nbsp;struggle exists 
            between our sinful flesh and the Holy Spirit.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The above observations make it evident 
              that sinful tendencies still exist in the life of even the most 
              mature Christian. As a result, no one is able to live a life truly 
            free from sin. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>The law </em><br>
              Reformed theologians believe that the law (the 10 commandments and 
              other precepts given to guide our lives) should be obeyed by Christians. 
              Christians who fail to keep the law do not face God's condemnation 
              (in this sense, they are not &quot;under the law&quot;), but they 
              should express their thankfulness to God by attempting to keep it. 
              John Calvin called this the &quot;third and principle use of the 
            law.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hoekema claims that obedience to the 
              law out of gratitude toward God is taught in the Old and New Testaments. 
              Old Testament examples include Exodus 20:2-17 and Psalm 19:7-8. 
              In the New Testament (Rom. 8:3-4, for example) Paul says the Holy 
              Spirit came in part to empower Christians to fulfill the law (Rom. 
              8:3-4). Hoekema even goes as far as to equate keeping the law with 
              walking in the Spirit. In addition, James 1:25 and 1 John 2:3-5 
              prove that law keeping is an avenue through which God sanctifies 
            us and brings us freedom. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><a name="Reaction to the Reformed view">Reaction 
              to the Reformed View</a> <br>
              </b>Hoekema takes an in-depth look at Col. 3:9-11, Eph. 4:22-26, 
              and Rom. 6:6 and concludes that &quot;the person who is in Christ 
              is no longer an old man or old self, but is now a new self&quot;<sup><a name="Ref33"></a><a href="#Note33">[33]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              This statement is accurate with regard to our position in Christ, 
              but less than accurate when describing our day-to-day experience. 
              To be sure, Rom. 6:6 teaches that the old man was crucified. I would 
              also agree that the putting off of the old self is described as 
              a past event in Col. 3:9-10. Paul is clear that at conversion, Christians 
              are freed from the life they used to live under the rule of sin. 
            In this positional sense, the old self has truly passed away. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Having said this, there are numerous 
              passages that suggest that our old lifestyle is not easily put off 
              and needs to be resisted. Paul urges his audience in Romans 6:11, 
              for example, to consider themselves &quot;to be dead to sin, but 
              alive to God in Christ Jesus.&quot; In Colossians 3:10, Paul says 
              the new self is going through an ongoing process of renewal. This 
              theme is repeated in Ephesians 4:23 where Paul urges: &quot;be renewed 
              in the spirit of your mind.&quot; Verse 23, which Hoekema describes 
              as an ongoing process,<sup><a name="Ref34"></a><a href="#Note34">[34]</a></sup> 
              comes in the middle of a discussion about putting off the old self 
              and putting on the new. If verse 23 describes a process, should 
              we read verses 22 and 24 any differently? The plain sense of Ephesians 
              4:20-24 implies that Christians must regularly lay aside the habits 
              associated with the old self and put those associated with the new. 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hoekema believes that Christians are 
              free from the law only in the sense that &quot;we are no longer 
              under condemnation because of our failure to keep the law.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref35"></a><a href="#Note35">[35]</a></sup> 
              &nbsp; &quot;In another sense,&quot; he continues, &quot;believers 
              are not free from the law. They should be deeply concerned about 
              keeping God's law as a way of expressing their gratitude to Him 
              for the gift of salvation.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref36"></a><a href="#Note36">[36]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              But Rom. 7:1-6 says that when someone becomes a Christian, their 
              relationship to the law fundamentally changes. Just as a widow is 
              no longer obligated to her husband, we have died to and been freed 
            from the law. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Some theologians argue that we are 
              only free from the ceremonial and civil portion of the law. However, 
              the law Paul discusses Romans 7 is the moral law. This is evident 
              when he quotes the moral part of the law in verse 7: &quot;I would 
              not have known about coveting if the law had not said, 'You shall 
              not covet.'&quot; Christians are free from the law - all of it. 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If this is true, how should we relate 
              to the law? Several passages indicate that the law still has a role 
              to play in the life of a Christian: Jesus says he did not come to 
              &quot;abolish the law but to fulfill it&quot; (Matt 5:17) and Paul 
              admits he is &quot;not without the law but under the law of Christ.&quot; 
              (1 Cor. 9:21) What role does the law play? The law acts as an objective 
              standard of morality that exposes sin (Rom. 7:7), it can stimulate 
              sin (Rom. 7:8,9), and it shows our need to depend of God for the 
            power to lead a moral life (Rom. 7:9b-24). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hoekema is correct in saying that we 
              are freed from the condemnation incurred by failing to keep the 
              law. But Paul says we are also free from trying to meet its demands 
              by our own power. In place of Hoekema's law keeping, Paul suggests 
              we walk in the newness of the Spirit (Rom. 7:6). It is the Spirit 
              inside us that is then able to keep the requirements of the law 
              (Rom. 8:3-4). Unfortunately, Hoekema takes Rom. 8:3-4 to mean &quot;Spirit-led 
              believers are precisely the ones doing their best to keep God's 
              law.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref37"></a><a href="#Note37">[37]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              He reduces walking in the Spirit to law keeping and entirely misses 
              the point of the passage: it is the power of the Spirit that enables 
            Christians to keep the law. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Departing from the traditional Reformed 
              view, Hoekema understands Rom. 7:13-25 to be Paul's recollection 
              of his struggle with sin as a non Christian. John Walvoord makes 
              an excellent defense against this view. He says, &quot;It is not 
              demonstrable that an unbeliever has two inner, contending natures.&quot; 
              I will leave further arguments in favor of Romans 7:13-25 describing 
            a Christian experience for an upcoming paper. </font></p>

              they must first undergo the crisis experience of entire sanctification. 
              This type of sanctification was seen as a definitive work of God's 
              grace that a believer receives much in the same way he receives 
            salvation. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Other Pentecostals (like those who 
              later formed the Assemblies of God) argued that putting one's faith 
              in Christ's forgiveness is the only precondition for receiving the 
              baptism of the Holy Spirit. They downplayed the importance of a 
              second (or third) work of grace in which Christians are entirely 
            sanctified, and instead viewed sanctification as process. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Further refinement of the Pentecostal 
              understanding of sanctification grew out of disagreements over the 
              nature of the trinity. In 1916, trinitarian disputes compelled the 
              Assemblies of God to clearly delineate their beliefs in the form 
              of a 16-point statement of faith. This document touched on sanctification, 
              but leaders soon recognized that the definition provided was vague 
              and poorly formulated. Over time, however, the definition of sanctification 
              was fleshed out. Instead of entire sanctification, they favored 
              instantaneous sanctification (see 1 Cor. 6:11-12) and progressive 
              sanctification (2 Cor. 3:15), that is, that Christians are positionally 
              sanctified at conversion but then progressively sanctified over 
              the course of their lives. The distinction between instantaneous 
              and progressive sanctification, promoted by the Assemblies of God, 
              moved away from the belief in entire sanctification espoused by 
            the Holiness wing of the Pentecostal movement. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The bulk of Horton's essay explains 
              the view of sanctification being taught today in the Assemblies 
              of God and focuses on the meaning of instantaneous, progressive, 
            and entire sanctification. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Instantaneous/ positional sanctification 
              </em><br>
              Instantaneous or positional sanctification is similar to the Reformed 
              notion of definitive sanctification. This type of sanctification: 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">- occurs at the moment of belief <br>
              - involves the believer being set apart from the world to follow 
              Christ <br>
              - is symbolized by baptism (Col. 2:11-12) <br>
              - occurs because we are united with Christ and given new life (1 
              Cor. 1:30) <br>
              - puts us in perfect relationship with God <br>
              - sets Christians free to do God's will <br>
            - is based on the finished work of Christ </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Progressive sanctification <br>
              </em>Horton cites a number of verses to show that Christians don't 
              always measure up to their positional sanctification. He points 
              out that the Corinthians, despite being called sanctified in 1 Cor. 
              6:11, were still addressed as &quot;infants&quot; in 1 Cor. 3:1. 
              Other passages indicate that self-control needs to be learned (1 
              Thes. 4:3-4), and that old habits, like lying, must be renounced 
            (Col. 3:5-10). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While Wesleyans claim they have been 
              released from willful sin through entire sanctification, Horton 
              believes these claims result in &quot;making God out to be a liar.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref39"></a><a href="#Note39">[39]</a></sup> 
              &nbsp; He also holds that the blood of Christ cleanses us from our 
              sin in an ongoing way. This is in contrast to the notion that there 
              is no need for Christians to repeatedly seek to be cleansed from 
            their sins. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">What does progressive sanctification 
              look like? According to Horton, Christians moving forward in this 
              process regularly put God's will into practice, demonstrate the 
              fruits of obedience, and exhibit a selfless willingness to do whatever 
            God asks them to do.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Entire sanctification </em><br>
              Pentecostals in the Assemblies of God reject Holiness claims to 
              be able to reach a state of sinless perfection in this life. They 
              contend that the old nature is still active in a Christian and that 
              claims of perfection depend on a weakened definition of sin. Despite 
              these objections, however, they still use the term &quot;entire 
              sanctification.&quot; Instead of abandoning the term, they redefine 
            it as: </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(1) following the purposes and desires 
              of God to the best of one's ability <br>
              or <br>
              (2) an event that occurs when Christ comes back and gives us glorified 
            bodies. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thus, the term entire sanctification 
              is being used here in a way that is entirely different than Wesley's 
            usage. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>The Spirit's Work in sanctification 
              </em><br>
              Pentecostals, mindful that the work of the Holy Spirit is often 
              neglected by other theological schools, are quick to point out the 
            role the Spirit plays in sanctification. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Horton believes that of all the works 
              of the Spirit, the New Testament highlights sanctification foremost. 
              &quot;The Holy Spirit here is the agent, and His work is the most 
              important means of our progressive sanctification.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref40"></a><a href="#Note40">[40]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              To underscore his point, he cites numerous verses that teach the 
            central role that the Holy Spirit plays in our growth (1 Cor. 6:11; 2 Thes. 2:13; Rom. 15:16; 1 Peter 1:1-2). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One of the most important ways that 
              the Holy Spirit helps sanctify Christians is by helping them to 
              understand and benefit from the Word of God. The Word itself is 
              the Spirit's primary tool in accomplishing our growth and maturity. 
              The Spirit teaches us the Word, guides us to the truth (John 14:17,26; 
              15:26; 16:12-13; 1 John 4:6) and uses the Word to &quot;give us 
              a clear vision of Jesus and inspire us with a deep desire to be 
              like him.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref41"></a><a href="#Note41">[41]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              Of course, Christians must cooperate with the Spirit's work in 
              their lives by depending on his Word for guidance and being willing 
            to obey it. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Baptism of the Holy Spirit </em><br>
              Perhaps the most unique feature of Pentecostal theology, and the 
              one that distinguishes it from other views on sanctification, is 
              the emphasis placed on the baptism of the Holy Spirit. This event 
              occurs in the life of a Christian after their salvation and &quot;empowers 
              (them) through the filling of the Spirit.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref42"></a><a href="#Note42">[42]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              Those who receive this baptism initially speak in tongues (Acts 
              10:46) and go on to lead lives of service &quot;marked by gifts 
              of the Spirit that bring power and wisdom for the spread of the 
              Gospel and the growth of the church.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref43"></a><a href="#Note43">[43]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Horton is quick to dispel misconceptions 
              about the baptism of the Holy Spirit. He agrees that it is not necessary 
              for salvation and that those who receive it may never have a continuing 
              ministry of speaking tongues in the church. But he warns that &quot;rejection 
              of the Pentecostal position and the evidence of other tongues often 
              leads to a downward trend that ends in the neglect of the Spirit's 
              work in the believer's life.&quot; In other words, it is hard to 
              experience the full life we were meant to have as Christians without 
            undergoing this baptism. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Having said that, Horton admits that 
              being baptized in the Holy Spirit is not a sanctifying experience 
              in and of itself. It doesn't elevate one to a higher level of sanctification 
              like Wesley's entire sanctification. Christians still need to deepen 
              in maturity and grow as they become more involved in selfless ministry 
            to other people. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Horton studiously avoids the overemphasis 
              on tongues often associated with the baptism of the Holy Spirit. 
              He says that Christians should strive for the &quot;greater gifts&quot; 
              mentioned in 1 Cor. 12:31, and believes gifts in general are most 
              likely to be discovered in the context of active service to God. 
              Horton also points out that love is &quot;necessary to make (spiritual) 
              gifts effective to the highest degree and to bring the proper reward.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref44"></a><a href="#Note44">[44]</a></sup>&nbsp;

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Summary </em><br>
              Holiness and Assemblies of God Pentecostals agree that justification 
              and positional sanctification occur at the same time. They also 
              agree that both man and God play a role in Christian growth. They 
              differ as to the definition of entire sanctification and whether 
              it is possible to live a life free from sin. The Assemblies of God 
              maintain that sin is not entirely removed in the life of a believer 
              and that sanctification is a long process of growth and change. 
              Holiness Pentecostals tend to view sanctification as a defining, 
            post-conversion event in the life of a Christian. </font></p>

              to the Pentecostal View</a> <br>
              </b>Horton believes that Christians are indwelled by the Spirit 
              when they are converted. In addition to the Spirit's indwelling, 
              Horton claims that Christians receive a second blessing called the 
              baptism of the Holy Spirit. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is a 
              post-conversion<sup><a name="Ref45"></a><a href="#Note45">[45]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              experience in which a Christian enjoys the true fullness of the 
              Spirit. It results in a higher level of devotion and increased ability 
              to evangelize and worship. This life-defining event is evidenced 
              by speaking in tongues, and enables believers &quot;to respond to 
              the full working of the Spirit.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref46"></a><a href="#Note46">[46]</a></sup> 
            &nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I find no biblical basis for the existence 
              of an additional work of the Spirit as described by Horton. His 
              belief that such an experience exists relies on (1) his interpretation 
              of 1 Cor. 12:13 and (2) a distinction he makes between baptism by 
            the Spirit and baptism in the Holy Spirit. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>1 Cor. 12:13 </em><br>
              The first part of 1 Cor. 12:13 says that Christians are baptized 
              by the Spirit and put into Christ. The second part says that Christians 
              are made to drink of one Spirit. Horton teaches the baptism and 
              the drinking describe two distinct events; being baptized into Christ 
              occurs at conversion and drinking of the Spirit (baptism of the 
              Holy Spirit) happens later. Refuting this claim, Hoekema says, &quot;the 
              second clause of (1 Cor. 12:13) is clearly parallel to the first 
              clause, since both clauses stress the oneness of all believers.&quot; 
              In other words, the second clause does not describe a new event, 
              but provides more information about what is being discussed. Verse 
              13 describes two aspects of one event: when we were baptized by 
              the Spirit, we were (1) put in the body of Christ and (2) indwelled 
              by the Holy Spirit. This interpretation is preferable, because it 
              takes into account Paul's repeated use of &quot;one&quot; throughout 
            the verse. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>&quot;by&quot; and &quot;in&quot; 
              </em><br>
              According to Horton, the phrase &quot;baptized by the Spirit&quot; 
              (1 Cor. 12:13a) refers to our being placed in Christ at conversion; 
              the phrase &quot;baptized in the Spirit&quot; refers to the second 
              blessing of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. This second baptism, 
              he claims, is described in several passages, including Luke 24:49, 
              Acts 1:8, and Acts 2:4. Remarkably, however, none of these passages 
            contain the phrase &quot;baptism in the Spirit.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A survey of passages where baptism 
              in, with, or by the Holy Spirit is used shows that in every case, 
              being indwelled with the Spirit is in view. In Matt 3:11, Mark 1:8, 
              Luke 3:16, and John 1:33, for example, Jesus is identified as one 
              who will baptize with/in the Holy Spirit. This baptism is described 
              as a future event. In Acts 1:5, Jesus reminds the disciples of this 
              baptism and says, &quot;John baptized with water, but you shall 
              be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.&quot; Jesus 
              is clearly associating the baptism with the Holy Spirit promised 
              in the gospels with the coming of the Holy Spirit on the day of 
              Pentecost. At Pentecost, followers of Christ were indwelled by the 
              Spirit for the first time.<sup><a name="Ref47"></a><a href="#Note47">[47]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Acts 11, Peter recounts how God 
              arranged a meeting between him and Cornelius. God told Peter to 
              visit Cornelius' household and preach the gospel. Before Peter came, 
              his audience was not saved (see verse 14 and 18) and therefore not 
              indwelled by the Spirit. After Peter preached the gospel to them, 
              they believed and were saved. Luke says the Holy Spirit came upon 
              them while they listened to Peter. He also associates the experience 
              with the baptism of the Spirit promised by John the Baptist. In 
              this passage, then, the baptism of the Holy Spirit occurs simultaneously 
            with salvation and involves the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In 1 Corinthians 12:13, which we have 
              already discussed, Paul tells us that when we were put into Christ 
            we were made to drink of (were indwelled by) one Spirit. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So when the New Testament discusses 
              the baptism of the Holy Spirit, it refers to an event in which the 
              Spirit comes to indwell a new believer. There is no reason to assume 
            that a second post-conversion event is in view. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Acts 2, Acts 8, Acts 19 </em><br>
              In a few passages in Acts, we find believers receiving the Spirit 
              well after they are converted. Doesn't this imply that a post-conversion 
              blessing of the Spirit is possible? I would say it's unlikely for 
            the following reasons: </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(1) In Acts 2 and 19, old covenant 
              Christians are being indwelled by the Spirit for the first time. 
              Tongues and other miraculous signs help to confirm that God's promise 
              to pour out the Spirit is being fulfilled and that the new covenant 
              is in effect. Peter calls the crowd's attention to this very fact 
            in his speech in Acts 2:17-21. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(2) Acts is a historical narrative 
              of an extraordinary time and, as such, should not be taken to record 
              normative Christian experiences. One would expect a doctrine as 
              important as the Pentecostal understanding of baptism of the Holy 
              Spirit to be explicitly taught elsewhere in scripture. But when 
              we look to the epistles, we search in vain for a single command 
              to seek a second, definitive baptism of the Spirit after our conversion. 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(3) In Acts 8:14-17, the coming of 
              the Holy Spirit may have been delayed to allow Peter to be the one 
              who opened the door of the gospel to the Gentiles. This is consistent 
              with Matt 16:19, where Jesus gives Peter the keys to the kingdom. 
              The outward sign of tongues also helped to confirm to Jewish Christians 
            that Gentiles could be included in the kingdom of God. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, a word should be said about 
              the notion that the tongues must accompany the baptism of the Holy 
            Spirit. This assertion is flawed for several reasons: </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(1) Episodes in Acts during which tongues 
              are spoken at the coming of the Holy Spirit are unique historical 
              situations. In these instances, tongues provide confirmation that 
              a new covenant is in effect (Acts 2, 19) and proof that those previously 
              viewed as not being God's people can now be included in the kingdom 
              (Acts 8, 10). There was a lot of resistance in the early church 
              to including Gentiles in the movement; tongues helped to prove to 
              Jews that Samaritans and Gentiles were also able to receive the 
            indwelling Spirit. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(2) Acts 2, 8, 10, and 19 are the only 
              places in scripture in which tongue-speaking is associated with 
              the baptism of the Holy Spirit. In other passages, the baptism of 
              the Holy Spirit occurs but no mention is made of tongues.<sup><a name="Ref48"></a><a href="#Note48">[48]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(3) In 1 Corinthians 12:30, Paul asks, 
              &quot;all do not speak with tongues, do they?&quot; The required 
              answer is: &quot;No, they don't.&quot; Yet despite this verse, Horton 
              maintains that everyone should receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit 
              and upon receiving it, everyone will speak in tongues. How is this 
              possible when Paul clearly says not every Christian can speak in 
              tongues?<sup><a name="Ref49"></a><a href="#Note49">[49]</a></sup>&nbsp;

              </b>According to J. Robertson McQuilkin, and those who hold the 
              Keswick view, the normal Christian life should be one of progress 
              and victory: victory over temptation, growth in obedience, improving 
              in self-control, and increasing in joy. Unfortunately, the average 
              Christian experience is far from normal. Church-goers are adept 
              at moving through the routines of the Christian life, yet they show 
              no excitement or evidence that anything supernatural is going on.

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">What can Christians do to break out 
              of this malaise? The Keswick view offers a message of hope to defeated 
              and backslidden Christians. Since 1875, proponents of this view 
              have offered four- and five-day conferences focusing on the spiritual 
              renewal of those who attend. These conferences expose those attending 
              to the depth of their sin, teach them a way to live a victorious 
              life, and challenge them to fully commit their lives to God and 
            to His service. A typical conference schedule includes: </font></p>

              </em>Since Keswick organizers and attendees have come from a variety 
              of theological persuasions, the Keswick view has no official or 
              well-defined statement on sanctification. Despite this, the core 
              values and emphases of the Keswick movement are well summarized 
            in the following quote from Steven Barabas: </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&quot;From the beginning 
              until the very present (the Keswick Movement) has taught that a

              of every child of God, and that he may step into it ..., 'not by 
              long prayers and laborious effort, but by a deliberate and decisive 
              act of faith.' It teaches that 'the normal experience of the child 
              of God should be one of victory instead of constant defeat, one 
              of liberty instead of grinding bondage, one of 'perfect peace' instead 
              of restless worry.'&quot;</font><font face="Arial" size="1"><sup><a name="Ref51"></a><a href="#Note51">[51]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>The Keswick view and perfectionism 
              </em><br>
              The Keswick movement has no clear stance on perfectionism. McQuilkin 
              claims that the Spirit makes it possible for Christians to consistently 
              avoid deliberate violations of God's will. And, like the Wesleyans, 
              McQuilkin believes there is a biblical basis for making a distinction 
              between willful, deliberate sin and unwitting sin. He claims a distinction 
              is clearly made in the Old Testament (see Exod. 21:12-14; Num. 15:27-31) 
              and is implied in several New Testament passages (see 1 John 1:8-10 
              and 1 John 3:6,8-10). In day to day life, however, McQuilkin concedes 
              that distinguishing between volitional and involuntary sin is difficult. 
              Departing from the Wesleyan view, he concludes that a definition 
              of sin should include all types (deliberate and accidental) and 
              expectations of perfection in this life are more frustrating for 
            sincere Christians than helpful. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Even though McQuilkin believes everyone 
              sins (1 John 1:8-10), he takes a dim view of Christians who continue 
              in a pattern of sinful activity. He suggests that they are probably 
              not Christians (1 John 3:6;8-10). In other words, everyone sins 
              unintentionally but ongoing deliberate sin is evidence that someone 
              is not genuinely converted. He goes as far as to say, &quot;(Christians) 
              need never - and should never - deliberately violate the known will 
              of God.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref52"></a><a href="#Note52">[52]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              Although he never says it directly, the implication is that if a 
              pattern of sin is established in the life of a Christian, part of 
              the healing process is reconsidering the validity of one's original 
            conversion experience. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, McQuilkin does concede that 
              believers still have a tendency to sin and must constantly rely 
              on the Holy Spirit to lean against this tendency. He attributes 
              this attraction to sin to the &quot;old nature&quot; and affirms 
              that our old nature remains in conflict with the indwelling Holy 
              Spirit even after conversion. It is because of their old nature 
              that committed Christians still commit unintentional sins. Growth 
              in the Christian life, then, is focused on minimizing the damage 
              caused by the sin nature in the area of involuntary sin. As McQuilkin 
              puts it, &quot;... much of our behavior falls short of Christ likeness 
              involuntarily and even unconsciously. It is in this area that the 
              normal Christian grows steadily to reflect more and more accurately 
              the likeness of Christ.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref53"></a><a href="#Note53">[53]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>The Keswick definition of sanctification 
              </em><br>
              Like most of the theologians in <em>Five Views of Sanctification</em>, 
              McQuilkin defines sanctification as a setting apart for service 
              to God. And, like the others, he says a moral dimension is involved: 
              those who are sanctified are set apart from sin and consecrated 
            to God. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">McQuilkin then breaks sanctification 
              down into three main types: positional, experiential, and permanent 
              sanctification. Positional sanctification occurs at conversion and 
              results in our forgiveness, justification in God's eyes and regeneration. 
              The new life of the Spirit indwells new believers and makes it possible 
              for righteousness to prevail over sin in their lives. This is the 
              sanctification spoken of in Heb. 10:10, Eph. 4:24, and 1 Cor. 1:2; 
            6:11. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Experiential sanctification is very 
              similar to the reformed idea of progressive sanctification. McQuilkin 
              defines it as &quot;the outworking of one's official position in 
              daily life.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref54"></a><a href="#Note54">[54]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              When we are given our new bodies and transformed to be like Christ, 
              permanent sanctification occurs. It results in the complete removal 
            of sin.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In parts of his essay, McQuilkin describes 
              sanctification as a process of growth that occurs over time in the 
              life of a Christian (2 Cor. 3:18, Col. 3:10, Eph. 4:15,16, 1 Thes. 
              4:1,10)<sup><a name="Ref55"></a><a href="#Note55">[55]</a></sup>&nbsp;. 
              However, he also believes the process is aided by a crisis experience 
              in which a Christian is profoundly struck by the depth of his sin, 
              made aware of God's provision for victorious living, challenged 
              to commit his whole person to Him, and taught to serve out of the 
              fullness of the Holy Spirit. McQuilkin says, for the backslidden 
              Christian, &quot;reentry into normal, supernatural Christian living 
              is through the gate of surrender.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref56"></a><a href="#Note56">[56]</a></sup>&nbsp;He 
              adds, &quot;for such a person, a normal, successful Christian experience 
              is not the product of a gradual process of spiritual development, 
              let alone automatic progress. A decisive turning point is needed.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref57"></a><a href="#Note57">[57]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Like the other four views of sanctification, 
              McQuilkin believes sanctification brings about changes in the way 
              we act (1 Cor. 6:9-10) and the way we think (Rom. 12:1,2). The overall 
              effect is that our lives more and more approximate the likeness 
            of Christ. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Ignorance and unbelief: the cause 
              of spiritual failure </em><br>
              More than other the other views we have studied so far, the Keswick 
              view of sanctification seeks to address the problem of the stumbling 
              or back-sliding Christian. According to McQuilkin, spiritual failure 
            results from two main causes: ignorance and unbelief. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Some Christians are ignorant of their 
              ability to live victorious lives. They are not aware of the provisions 
              God has made to enable them to conduct a vital walk with Him. Usually, 
              though, struggling Christians are defeated by unbelief. According 
              to McQuilkin, unbelief is the root cause of disobedience and lack 
              of faith. Disobedient Christians, for example, often are afraid 
              to trust God because they do not believe what He says. For some, 
              this leads to outward rebellion, but most drift away from God through 
              sins of omission and a failure to pursue Him. Christians who lack 
              faith are reluctant to depend on God's power for ministry. Their 
              fundamental unbelief and distrust of God leads them to rely on themselves 
            in an attempt to attain godliness through their own power. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>The cure for spiritual failure 
              </em><br>
              Whatever the cause, McQuilkin's solution to a subnormal Christian 
              experience is faith. &quot;Simple faith is the secret.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref58"></a><a href="#Note58">[58]</a></sup> 
              &nbsp; Faith is the ultimate answer to the question of sin in the 
              life of the believer. No one can bring about his own sanctification. 
              It is only as we place our faith in God and His resources that we 
            can experience a victorious Christian life. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">McQuilkin defines simple faith as &quot;a 
              choice to commit all of oneself unconditionally to the person of 
              God, who is revealed in the Bible and witnessed to by the Holy Spirit.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref59"></a><a href="#Note59">[59]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              This is in contrast to &quot;false faith,&quot; which occurs when 
              the object of faith is someone or something other than God, or when 
              faith is not a commitment of the whole person. The commitment inherent 
              in sanctifying faith is demonstrated by a willingness to step out, 
              in obedience to the truth, to do God's will. This commitment to 
              do God's will, is, according to McQuilkin, &quot;the most important 
              evidence of faith.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref60"></a><a href="#Note60">[60]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Those who continue in deliberate violation 
              of God's will are not exercising faith and for them, no growth is 
              possible. They must first surrender to God and obey him. This need 
              for surrender often results in a crisis in the life of Christians. 
              Accustomed to living as they see fit, they are forced to decide 
              if they will abandon rebellion and make a decision to wholly commit 
              to God. This crisis does not arise in the life of every Christian, 
            but from McQuilkin's experience it does more often than not. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Filling of the Spirit </em><br>
              When someone becomes a Christian, Christ gives them the indwelling 
              presence of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. As a result, a process 
              of change is initiated with a view to the renewal of the person 
              in the image of God. Now, for the first time, they have the ability 
              to choose against sin. With God's power they are able to follow 
              Him. This new power, mediated through the Spirit, is available to 
              Christians through a process called &quot;filling.&quot; McQuilkin 
              explores the meaning of the phrase &quot;filling of the Spirit&quot; 
              and advances a definition centered around the concept of control: 
            </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Filled with the Spirit 
              is a figurative, poetic expression that refers primarily to the 
              relationship between two persons in which one is in charge.&quot;</font><font face="Arial" size="1"><sup><a name="Ref61"></a><a href="#Note61">[61]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&quot;(filled with the Spirit) 
              means that the Holy Spirit dominates, has full control, possesses... 
              though the dominion (is) gracious, by invitation only, and does 
              not... override one's personal choice.&quot;</font><font face="Arial" size="1"><sup><a name="Ref62"></a><a href="#Note62">[62]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">McQuilkin is not clear in his essay 
              as to the duration of this experience. He says that the expression 
              &quot;filled with the Spirit&quot; refers to a &quot;state or condition&quot; 
              and that &quot;we are commanded to be filled continually.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref63"></a><a href="#Note63">[63]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">McQuilkin concludes that being filled 
              with the Spirit is the key to living an effective and victorious 
              Christian life. Additionally, there may be times of special empowering 
              that go above and beyond normal filling. These special empowerings 
              enable Christians to serve effectively in more challenging situations. 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>The means of growth </em><br>
              According to the Keswick view, sanctification is facilitated by 
              the means of growth: prayer, learning the scripture, fellowship 
              and suffering. Each of these avenues are used by God to bring us 
              into conformity with Him. In the midst of suffering, for example, 
              Christians are presented with an opportunity to look to God for 
              the good he can perform and to grow in dependence on Him. McQuilkin 
              also points out that the means of growth should be pursued aggressively 
              and with the realization that God is the one bringing about change. 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The impact of the means of growth on 
              individuals varies widely. As a result, Christians should resist 
              the temptation to measure their own growth in comparison with others 
            and should instead keep before them the example of Christ. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Summary </em><br>
              Over the years, the Keswick movement has drawn inspiration from 
              leaders of a variety of theological perspectives. For this reason, 
              McQuilkin sees the Keswick view as a mediating position on sanctification 
              that avoids the extremes of some views. He concludes that it has 
              a balanced perspective on the Biblical data and much to contribute 
            to the discussion on sanctification. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><a name="Reaction to the Keswick view">Reaction 
              to the Keswick View</a> <br>
              </b>I agree with McQuilkin's statement that &quot;sin according 
              to the Bible is defined as any falling short of the glorious moral 
              perfection of God himself.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref64"></a><a href="#Note64">[64]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              But like Wesley, McQuilkin muddies the definition of sin by introducing 
              a distinction between sins that are deliberate and those that are 
              &quot;unconscious&quot; or &quot;unwitting.&quot; In my reaction 
              to the Wesleyan view, I argued that the New Testament does not make 
            such a distinction. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Assuming a distinction can be made 
              between deliberate and unwitting sin, McQuilkin asserts that sanctification 
            is only concerned with the latter area. He says, </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Growth into more Christlike 
              behavior is in areas of unconscious sin or sins of omission, falling 
              short of Godlike qualities. In deliberate sin, there is no pattern 
              of gradual growth.&quot;</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> <sup><a name="Ref65"></a><a href="#Note65">[65]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For McQuilkin, Christian growth is 
              restricted to improving on godlike qualities that are yet to be 
              fully developed. Christians don't sin less; they become more godly. 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Certainly, developing Godlike qualities 
              is an important part of sanctification. These qualities are the 
              fruit of the spirit and every Christian should pursue them. However, 
              the renewal of our new man into Christ's image (Col. 3:10) is not 
              enough. Our old man must also be put off (Eph. 4:22). While character 
              is being developed, sin must also be dealt with. In Gal. 5:16-6:10, 
              Paul portrays Christians engaged in a struggle between the flesh 
              and the Spirit (5:17). Sometimes they lose this struggle and fall 
              into sin (6:1). If this occurs, members of the body should recognize 
              their own vulnerability to temptation and restore the fallen brother 
              (6:2,3). Christians should not lose heart in this war over the flesh; 
              they should strive to continue doing good (6:9,10). We don't know 
              the nature of the trespass mentioned in verse 1 or whether the act 
              was deliberate or unconscious, ongoing or isolated. We are not given 
              information about the severity of the sin or the nature of the consequences. 
              We are simply told that sinning Christians need to be restored and 
              that everyone should strive to continue doing good. Christian growth 
              is not limited in this passage to the developing of Godly qualities. 
              Sin is a reality that must be faced and overcome in the life of 
            a Christian. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Instead of taking the redemptive approach 
              suggested by Paul, McQuilkin claims that real Christians &quot;need 
              never - and should never - deliberately violate the known will of 
              God.&quot; To McQuilkin, the issue is settled by passages like 1 
              John 3:4-10. In verse 9, John says, &quot;no one who is born of 
              God practices sin.&quot; Here, McQuilkin infers that if someone 
              sins deliberately, his salvation is called into question. I believe 
              this is a misunderstanding of what John is trying to say. Earlier 
              in the same letter (1:8-10), John tells those who say they don't 
              sin that they deceive themselves. In the next chapter (2:1,2), he 
              implies that Christians can and do sin and affirms that Jesus' death 
              covers their sins. John also says those who focus on the hope of 
              their future conformity to Christ &quot;purify themselves.&quot; 
              (1 John 3:3) John clearly assumes that there is sin in the life 
            of a Christian to be purified from. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">What then is the meaning of 1 John 
              3:4-10? We've seen above that Christians sin, but John seems to 
              rule out the possibility of sin in this passage. The problem is 
              resolved when we consider the language John uses and the situation 
            he is addressing. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Language:</em> The present tense 
              of the verbs for sin and repeated use of &quot;practice&quot; in 
              1 John 3:4,8a,9a suggest that an ongoing lifestyle of sin is being 
            addressed. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Situation:</em> Most commentators 
              agree that John's readers were influenced by Gnostic teachers who 
              advocated throwing off moral restraints. John's warning in 1 John 
              3:8, &quot;let no one deceive you; the one who practices righteousness 
              is righteous,&quot; indicates that he has these teachers primarily 
            in mind. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When we understand the language and 
              the situation, John's message becomes clear: false teachers who 
              claim to be Christians betray their true identity by their ongoing 
              sin and disregard for God's will. John is not saying, however, that 
              someone who sins deliberately is not a Christian. That interpretation 
              adds a distinction to the definition of sin that John never makes, 
            and it also completely contradicts the tone of 1 John 2:2. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Christian growth, therefore, involves 
              a combination of laying aside our old sinful habits and embracing 
              the positive character qualities God wants to bring about in our 
            lives. The Keswick view misses this balance. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">McQuilkin's description of being filled 
              with the Spirit is helpful. It is, indeed, the key to living an 
              effective Christian life. The reader is left wondering, though, 
              how this &quot;filling&quot; is obtained. As John Walvoord comments, 
              &quot;it would be helpful... if the means by which one may be filled 
              with the spirit would be more carefully delineated.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref66"></a><a href="#Note66">[66]</a></sup> 
            &nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is also difficult to determine the 
              importance and nature of the crisis experience that McQuilkin discusses 
              on page 171. He suggests that there comes a point in the life of 
              most Christians when they must decisively surrender their own self-will 
              and place themselves under the authority of Christ. This crisis 
              experience is a turning point in their lives and is very important 
              to their growth. McQuilkin doesn't tell us, however, whether the 
              experience is a one time event or repeated at regular intervals. 
            A single, definitive event seems to be in view. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Certainly, the New Testament narrates 
              important crises in the life of Christians that play a major role 
              in their sanctification. Paul, for example, indicates that on at 
              least two occasions, adverse circumstances helped him to gain deeper 
              insight into God's character. In 2 Cor. 1:8,9, he says, &quot;we 
              had the sentence of death within ourselves in order that we should 
              not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead.&quot; And 
              when suffering from his famous &quot;thorn in the flesh,&quot; God 
              was able to teach him, &quot;my grace is sufficient for you, for 
              power is perfected in weakness.&quot; (2 Cor. 12) The call for total 
              surrender to God in passages like Rom. 12:1,2 has no doubt produced 
              a crisis in the life of many Christians. But the New Testament does 
              not urge Christians to seek or to expect life-defining post conversion 
              crisis experiences. These times may come for some, but our challenge 
              is instead to &quot;not lose heart,&quot; to &quot;not growing weary&quot; 
              (Gal. 6:9-10) and to &quot;press on&quot; (Phil. 3:12,14) knowing 
              all the while we are far from perfect (Phil. 3:12-14). Hoekema adds, 
              &quot;I agree... that some, possibly many, Christians need to surrender 
              their wills in total commitment to the Lord sometime after their 
              conversion... I disagree, however that a specific post-conversion 
              crisis experience needs to be programmed into the lives of most 
              Christians.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref67"></a><a href="#Note67">[67]</a></sup>&nbsp;

              <br>
              </b>According to John Walvoord, differences in the various approaches 
              to sanctification center mainly on the degree to which a person 
              is transformed after becoming a Christian. Some say that at conversion 
              people are completely changed. Others argue that vestiges of their 
              old life remain. At the center of the debate is the term &quot;nature&quot; 
              and, more specifically, &quot;sin nature.&quot; Walvoord maintains 
              that differences of opinion can be resolved if these terms are more 
            carefully defined. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In contrast to a substantive use of 
              the word &quot;nature,&quot;<sup><a name="Ref68"></a><a href="#Note68">[68]</a></sup> 
              Walvoord's definition of &quot;sin nature&quot; focuses more on 
              a Christian's capacity for or inclination towards sin. This can 
              be seen in Walvoord's definition: &quot;The concept of a sin nature 
              can probably best be summarized as a complex of human attributes 
              that demonstrate a desire and predisposition to sin.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref69"></a><a href="#Note69">[69]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Walvoord also discusses the relationship 
              between the sin nature and the terms &quot;flesh&quot; and &quot;old 
              man/ new man.&quot; He believes that Augustine's concept of the 
              flesh is synonymous with the biblical use of sin nature. Here, the 
              flesh is seen as that which remains in a person following his conversion. 
              Walvoord takes a different approach with the old man/ new man language 
              used in Colossians 3 and Ephesians 4. He says these terms shouldn't 
              be confused with the sinful nature and the new nature inside a Christian. 
              Old man/ new man instead refers to the change of lifestyle that 
              occurs when someone is saved; Christians lay aside their old manner 
              of life and put on a new one. Sin nature and new nature, by contrast, 
              refer to a state of being, not just a lifestyle. Walvoord points 
            out: </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Once a person is saved, 
              the spiritual state of that person includes a new nature and an 
              old nature... The believer still has an old nature - a complex of 
              attributes with an inclination and disposition to sin; and the new 
              nature... a complex of attributes... (that) incline and dispose 
              the Christian to a new manner of life, one that is holy in the sight 
              of God.&quot;</font><font face="Arial" size="1"><sup><a name="Ref70"></a><a href="#Note70">[70]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Like proponents of the Reformed view, 
              Augustinian-Dispensationalists affirm that a sin nature, or sinful 
              tendency, exists in the life of every Christian (see Rom. 7:14-25 
              and Gal. 5:16-17). Because Walvoord maintains that an old nature 
              is still present, he believes that Christians may progress in their 
              sanctification, but that they will never be free from sin in this 
            life. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Regeneration and the baptism of 
              the Holy Spirit </em><br>
              Walvoord says that two things occur at conversion: regeneration 
              and the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Regeneration occurs at the point 
              of conversion, involves the granting of eternal life and the new 
              nature, and moves a Christian from spiritual death to life. It does 
              not, as some suggest, &quot;bring perfection of character or freedom 
              from a sin nature.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref71"></a><a href="#Note71">[71]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              The baptism of the Holy Spirit, spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12:13, 
              is the placement, at the moment of conversion, of the convert into 
              the body of Christ. When we are identified with Christ in this way, 
              we share in his death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:1-4; Col. 
              2:12). As a result, we can utilize God's power and guidance for 
              our lives. This experience was inaugurated on the day of Pentecost 
              and occurs to anyone the moment they repent and turn to Christ. 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>The indwelling and filling of the 
              Holy Spirit </em><br>
              All Christians, at the point of conversion, are indwelled by the 
              Holy Spirit. The Spirit's indwelling is God's first phase in His 
              plan to conform us to His image. It is also the basis for our sanctification, 
              because through the Spirit we receive spiritual gifts and the power 
              to live effective Christian lives. This indwelling ministry of the 
              Holy Spirit is unique to the church age (the period of time following 
              the day of Pentecost) and is qualitatively different than the pre-Pentecost 
            ministry of the Spirit (see John 7:37-39). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While all Christians can be said to 
              be indwelled by the Holy Spirit, not all have been filled by the 
              Spirit. Walvoord defines the filling of the Spirit as &quot;the 
              unhindered ministry of the Holy Spirit in the life of a Christian.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref72"></a><a href="#Note72">[72]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
              Unlike the baptism of the Holy Spirit, which is a one-time event 
              that permanently places us in Christ, filling is a temporary state, 
              an experience that Christians should regularly seek to have. This 
              is implied by the present continuous tense of Ephesians 5:18: &quot;Don't 
              be drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled (or, 
            'go on being filled') with the Holy Spirit.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When someone is filled with the Spirit, 
              they are empowered to carry out the will of God. This is evident 
              from numerous passages that describe the Spirit's filling (including 
              Acts 2:4; 4:8,31; 6:3,5; 7:55; 9:17; 11:24). Much in the same way 
              that alcohol permeates our body and effects the way we act, when 
              one is filled with the Spirit, the Spirit is in control. Walvoord 
              writes that being filled by the Spirit &quot;brings for the time 
              being a control of a believer's life by the Holy Spirit and the 
              infusion of spiritual power, enabling a Christian to do far more 
              than he or she could do naturally.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref73"></a><a href="#Note73">[73]</a></sup> 
            &nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Becoming filled by the Holy Spirit 
              is a matter of yielding oneself wholly to God. This yielding must 
              occur both in the area of God's revealed will and in accepting the 
              life circumstances that God has placed us in. According to Paul, 
              in Romans 6, believers must choose whether they will yield themselves 
              to God or to sin. When someone fully places his life under God's 
              control (e.g. Rom. 12:1-2) the Spirit is given free reign to empower 
              him. A good example of this attitude can be seen in Philippians 
              2:5-11 when Jesus completely submits in obedience to God and places 
            all trust in Him. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When Christians stumble and sin, the 
              indwelling Spirit is grieved (Ephesians 4:30) and is hindered in 
              His ability to minister to them. But there is no danger of loss 
              of salvation; the person still remains indwelled by the Spirit. 
              Instead, Christians should confess their sins to God and appropriate 
            the forgiveness that Jesus obtained for them on the cross. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">According to Walvoord, living an effective 
              Christian life requires that we cultivate an attitude of continuous 
              dependence on the power of the Spirit to energize us and make us 
              effective for service. When we turn from God and continue in sin, 
              we won't be filled with the Spirit. Instead of experiencing power, 
              we will experience God's corrective discipline (1 Cor. 11:31-32; 
              Heb. 12:5-6). But if we yield our selves fully to him, he will fill 
              us with the Holy Spirit, and do things through us we could never 
            do on our own. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>The resulting experience of progressive 
              sanctification </em><br>
              Christians who put their full trust in God and walk in dependence 
              on the Spirit's power may never attain to God's standard of perfection 
              in this life, but they can expect to steadily grow in sanctification. 
              The Holy Spirit makes this possible by giving us increasing assurance 
              of our salvation, providing insight into God's will for our lives, 
              helping us to worship and pray, and using us as a channel of His 
              life in our service to others. The fruit of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22-23) 
              is evidence that this process is occurring and the result is that 
              &quot;a mighty work for God can be accomplished&quot;<sup><a name="Ref74"></a><a href="#Note74">[74]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            in the life of the believer. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>God and man's role in sanctification 
              </em><br>
              Walvoord maintains that some Calvinists have overemphasized God's 
              sovereignty, not just in relation to conversion but also in their 
              view of sanctification. He claims that this imbalance has had detrimental 
              effect, making some Calvinists reluctant to carry out the great 
              commission. This reluctance, Walvoord says, stems from a belief 
              that minimizes human responsibility (e.g. &quot;If God has elected 
              some to salvation, they will surely be saved regardless of our efforts.&quot;).<sup><a name="Ref75"></a><a href="#Note75">[75]</a></sup> 
              &nbsp; A Calvinist himself, Walvoord sees a need to balance an emphasis 
              on God's sovereignty with the awareness that human choices have 
              a critical impact on Christian growth. Walvoord writes, &quot;God 
              is the sanctifier... however... people are responsible for responding 
              to the truth of God and to the work of the Holy Spirit.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref76"></a><a href="#Note76">[76]</a></sup>&nbsp;

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Ultimate perfection </em><br>
              Walvoord says we are destined, eventually, to be conformed to the 
              image of Christ and perfectly sanctified, regardless of our present 
              shortcomings. Sanctification in this life is shaped by our choices 
              and will never be complete, but scripture promises the full removal 
              of sin and imperfection from our lives when we stand before God 
              (Eph. 5:25-27; 1 John 3:2). In light of this, Walvoord concludes 
              that &quot;sanctification is the work of God for human beings rather 
              than our work for him.&quot; In the future, we will be conformed 
              to the image of Christ and reflect His glory. Then, all of the credit 
            for that work will go to God. </font></p>

              Christian life. I believe his description of how to be filled with 
              the Spirit, however, to be focused too narrowly on submission and 
              obedience. Walvoord suggests that total surrender to Christ and 
              avoiding actions that might grieve the Spirit are the keys to being 
              filled by the Spirit. While surrender to Christ allows the Spirit 
              to characterize our actions, this is only one of many ways that 
              Christians can facilitate their being filled by the Holy Spirit. 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">More insight into how to be filled 
              by the Holy Spirit can be found when we realize how similar the 
              concept is to walking according to the Spirit (e.g. Rom. 8:1-11). 
              Both are temporary states that Christians must choose to enter into<sup><a name="Ref77"></a><a href="#Note77">[77]</a></sup>&nbsp;. 
              Both involve being empowered by the Spirit to live effective Christian 
              lives (Acts 4:8; Acts 7:55ff; Gal. 5:22-23). Once this connection 
              is established between walking and filling, several suggestions 
            can be made about how to enjoy the full power of the Spirit: </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(1) Develop the correct mental outlook. 
              Paul urges the Romans to set their minds on the things of the Spirit 
              (see Rom. 8:5-7). <br>
              (2) Cultivate an attitude of dependence on the Spirit (Rom. 8:3-4) 
              through the regular expression of gratitude and recognition of what 
              God has done for you (Eph. 5:18-20). <br>
              (3) Respond to God's personal leading. Gal. 5:18 and Rom. 8:14 suggest 
              that being led by the Spirit and walking by the Spirit are virtually 
              synonymous. <br>
              (4) Realize that engaging in bitter disputes and sinning against 
              others will grieve the Spirit and minimize His ability to work through 
            you (Eph. 4:30). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><a name="My view of sanctification">My 
              View of Sanctification</a> <br>
              </b>The key components of my view of sanctification have been suggested 
              in my comments on the other views. I will present my view, then, 
            in summary form: </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Definition </em><br>
              - Sanctify comes from the Greek word <em>hagiadzo</em>, meaning 
              to be set apart or made fit for service (2 Timothy 2:19-22). <br>
              - Sanctification has a moral dimension (1 Thes. 4:3-7). It involves 
              turning away from immorality and turning towards God (Eph. 4:22-24; 
              Gal. 5:16-6:5). <br>
              - Sanctification is spoken of as an accomplished event (1 Cor. 1:30,31;1 
              Cor. 6:11;Col. 3:9-10) <em>and</em> as an ongoing process (Eph. 
              4:15-16,23). We are sanctified in our position in Christ but our 
              condition is far from perfect. We still sin and won't be perfected 
            until Jesus returns (1 Thes. 5:23-24). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Sin </em><br>
              - Sin is any word, thought or action that that falls short of God's 
              perfect character (Rom. 3:23; Matt. 5; Rom. 14:23). Distinctions 
              between &quot;deliberate&quot; and &quot;unconscious&quot; sins, 
              or &quot;willful&quot; sins and &quot;mistakes,&quot; are not made 
              in the New Testament. <br>
              - No Christian is without sin (1 John 2:2; James 3:2; Phil. 3). 
              <br>
              - There is a struggle between the flesh and the Spirit inside every 
              Christian (Gal. 5:17). Sometimes Christians lose this struggle and 
              fall into sin (Gal. 6:1). If this occurs, other Christians should 
              recognize their own vulnerability to temptation and restore the 
              fallen brother (Gal. 6:2,3). Christians should not lose heart in 
            this process, but continue doing good (Gal. 6:9,10). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Sin nature/ old man </em><br>
              - Christians are new creatures (2 Cor. 5:21) who have been freed 
              from sin (Rom. 6:6-7). <br>
              - The old self is laid aside when a Christian is put into Christ 
              (Col. 3:9-11; Rom. 6:6), but our habits and ways of thinking still 
              present problems (Eph. 4:22-24). <br>
              - We still have our body of sin to reckon with (Eph. 4:22-24; Gal. 
              5:16-17). <br>
              - As a result, the habits of the old self need to be put aside daily 
              as we learn to act consistently with our new identity in Christ 
            (Eph. 4:22-24). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Perfection </em><br>
              <em>- </em>Christians will never reach a sinless state on this side 
              of the grave (Phil. 3:12-16; James 3:2; 1 John 1:8-10). I reject 
              the Wesleyan notion of freedom from known sin and the Keswick teaching 
              on freedom from deliberate sin. Claims to perfection are fertile 
            ground for self-deception and rationalization. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Process/ Crisis </em><br>
              <em>- </em>Numerous passages teach that sanctification is an ongoing 
              process (Gal. 3:3; Eph. 4:15-16; 1 Thes. 4:1,10; 2 Peter 1:3-8). 
              During this process, the new man is transformed into Christ's image 
              (2 Cor. 3:18; Eph. 4:23; Col. 3:10) and increased victory is won 
              over sin (Eph. 4:22-24; Gal. 5:16-6:5; 1 Thes. 4:3-7). <br>
              - Crises that promote growth can and do occur in the life of a Christian 
              (2 Cor. 1:8-11; 2 Cor. 12:1-10). The New Testament teaches nowhere, 
              however, that crises such as surrender (Keswick), entire sanctification 
              (Wesley), or the Baptism of the Holy Spirit are normative experiences 
              that should be sought by all Christians. Christians are never urged 
              to seek life-defining post-conversion crisis experiences. Instead 
              we hear more about not losing heart, not growing weary (Gal. 6:9-10) 
              and pressing on with the acknowledgment we have not become perfect 
            (Phil. 3:12-16; Gal. 5:16-6:10). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>God's role and man's role </em><br>
              <em>- </em>God accomplishes our sanctification (1 Thes. 5:24;Phil. 
              1:6; Hebrews 13:20-21) through the agency of the Holy Spirit (1 
              Peter 1:2). He causes us to grow and change, and we cooperate (Phil. 
              2:12-13). We pursue our sanctification (1 Tim. 6:11; Heb. 12:14), 
              trust God that we are free from sin (Rom. 6:11) and that he can 
              renew us (Col. 3:1-11), and participate in the means of grace: learning 
              the Word of God (1 Peter 2:2), participating in fellowship (Eph. 
              4:15-16), responding to God's discipline (Heb. 12:11), praying (Rom. 
              8:26; James 5:16), and giving our lives away to serve others (John 
            13:17). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Maturity </em><br>
              <em>- </em>The Bible does make distinctions between the maturity 
              level of different Christians (Heb. 5:11-14; Gal. 5:13-15; 1 Cor. 
              2:6). But this distinction is based on knowledge of the Word of 
              God, not on whether or not someone has had an experience such as 
            entire sanctification. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Baptism of Holy Spirit </em><br>
              <em>- </em>The Baptism of the Holy Spirit occurs at conversion and 
              involves the placement of a new convert into the body of Christ 
              and the receiving of the indwelling presence of the Spirit (1 Cor. 
              12:13). Nowhere does the Bible urge Christians to seek a second 
              baptism of, in, by, or with the Holy Spirit after their conversion. 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Role of the Holy Spirit in sanctification 
              </em><br>
              <em>- </em>The Spirit fills believers and empowers Christians for 
              service (Eph. 5:18; Acts 4:8; Acts 7:55) and is responsible for 
              transforming them into conformity with Christ (Rom. 8:4,11). <br>
              - The filling of the Holy Spirit is a temporary experience that 
              Christians must repeatedly seek. Through this filling, the Holy 
              Spirit empowers Christians to serve God more effectively (Acts 4:8,31; 
              6:3,5; 7:55; 9:17; 11:24). <br>
              - The filling of the Holy Spirit is similar if not identical to 
              Paul's notion of &quot;walking according to the Spirit&quot; in 
              Rom. 8:1-11. <br>
              - The Spirit also helps Christians to understand the meaning of 
              scripture (1 Cor. 2:12; I John 2:27), assures believers they are 
              God's children (Rom. 8:16), and distributes gifts to help Christians 
            serve more effectively (1 Cor. 12:7; 1 Peter 4:10). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A Final Word About Crisis Experiences 
              <br>
              </b>In this paper, I have been critical of two crisis experiences: 
              the Keswick notion of surrender and the Pentecostal description 
              of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. If someone is urged to pursue 
              one of these experiences or is told that these experiences are normative 
              for Christians, I believe damage can result. He or she may become 
              unnecessarily disappointed that the experience never comes, or they 
              may be tempted to fake the experience in order to be viewed as spiritual. 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is not to say that life-changing 
              post-conversion experiences never happen to Christians. The Keswick 
              experience of surrender no doubt occurs in the lives of some Christians 
              (although it does not result in freedom from deliberate sin). Other 
              life-defining post-conversion experiences occur as well. But we 
              are never told in the Bible that Christians should seek out these 
            experiences or that they are normative for all believers. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Despite potential for excesses and 
              potential for problems, Christians should not avoid spiritual or 
              crisis experiences altogether. Francis Schaeffer points out, &quot;Christianity 
              is not only intellectual...Christianity is the reality of communion 
              with God in the present life; it is the understanding that there 
              is the indwelling Spirit; it is the understanding that there is 
              the moment by moment empowering of the Holy Spirit... It is the 
              understanding that the fruit of the Spirit is something real to 
              all Christians. It is the understanding that prayer is real and 
              not just a devotional exercise. Indeed we must not overreact to... 
              super-spirituality, but we must stress that Christ... means us to 
              affirm life and not negate life. Such is the ideal. May God show 
              us the living balance and help us to live, by his grace, in that 
              balance.&quot;<sup><a name="Ref78"></a><a href="#Note78">[78]</a></sup>&nbsp; 
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Altogether rejecting crisis experiences 
              would strip our Christian lives of some of the most profound and 
              rewarding events that occur in our lives. The result would be a 
              dead and lifeless orthodoxy that is just as destructive as overemphasizing 
              experience. We should be grateful, as Paul was, when, through adversity 
              or the overflow of the Spirit, we are granted accelerated growth 
              or deeper insight into God's character. But we can't expect that 
              these events will <em>always</em> occur in the life of <em>every</em> 
            Christian. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While affirming healthy spiritual experiences, 
              we should teach people to view sanctification as a process. During 
              this process, Christians enjoy the power and presence of the Holy 
              Spirit as He helps them to live in dependence on Him, have victory 
              over sin, and serve effectively</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">.

              Many Pentecostals believe that the baptism of the Holy Spirit typically

              I believe that John 7:39 (&quot;the Spirit had not been given, since 
              Jesus had not yet been glorified&quot;) and John 17:1 (&quot;Father, 
              the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you&quot;) 
              imply that the disciples were not indwelled by the Holy Spirit prior 
              to Jesus' glorification. Most theologians believe Jesus was glorified 
              in his crucifixion, resurrection and exaltation (John 13:31-32). 
              So the disciples could not have been indwelled by the Spirit prior 
              to Jesus' resurrection. In John 20:22, during a post resurrection 
              appearance, Jesus breathes on the disciples and says, &quot;receive 
              the Holy Spirit.&quot; Does this mean they were indwelled by the 
              Spirit? That is a possible interpretation. If true, at Pentecost 
              the disciples were given a special filling to be effective witnesses 
              while everyone else was being Indwelled for the first time. Another 
              possible interpretation of John 20:22 recognizes that Jesus breathed 
              the spirit on them in connection with his sending them out to witness 
              (20:21) and that this act anticipated the future indwelling of the 
              Holy Spirit to empower them to witness (Acts 1:7). Admittedly there 
            are some difficulties with either view. <i>Return to <a href="#Ref47">Text</a></i></font></p>

              &nbsp; Baptism of the Holy Spirit, as I have defined it, occurs 
              at conversion. Luke records several conversions (Acts 8, 16) where 
            no mention is made of tongues. <i>Return to <a href="#Ref48">Text</a></i></font></p>

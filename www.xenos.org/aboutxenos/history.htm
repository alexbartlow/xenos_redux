        <h1><img src="graphics/hstphil4.gif" width="270" height="220" align="right" />History of Xenos</h1>
        <p>In 1970, some Ohio State University students, including future lead 
          pastor, <a href="../personal/den.htm">Dennis McCallum</a>, began printing 
          an underground newspaper in the basement of their rooming house, a practice 
          that was popular among students in those days. But theirs was no ordinary 
          underground newspaper. <i>The Fish</i> derived its name from the Greek 
          word for &quot;fish,&quot; <i>Icthus</i>, which was also an acronym 
          used by early Christians meaning &quot;Jesus Christ, God's Son, the 
          Savior.&quot; <i>The Fish</i> was dedicated to helping other students 
          discover that Jesus Christ holds the key for humanity's problems.</p>
        <p><img src="graphics/fish.png" alt="Early editions of The Fish" width="200" height="137" align="right" />Their 
          rooming house on East 16th Avenue was no ordinary student house either. 
          Known as &quot;The Fish House&quot; because of its association with 
          the paper, it became a center for regular Bible studies. These meetings, 
          referred to as &quot;The Fish House Fellowship&quot; attracted students 
          searching for answers during turbulent times. Future co-lead pastor, 
          <a href="../personal/gary.htm">Gary DeLashmutt</a> moved into the house 
          in 1971.</p>
        <p><i>The Fish</i> newspaper has long since vanished, but today the Bible
           studies it spawned are flourishing. The old Fish House Fellowship,
          which 
          adopted the name &quot;Xenos Christian Fellowship&quot; in 1982, has
           grown into an interdenominational, evangelical church that, as of
          2004, 
          includes more than 4,500 people from all walks of life.</p>
        <h3>Foundations </h3><table width="180" align="right">

		    <p>For years, Xenos was a disorganized association of house-based groups 
          scattered around the campus of The Ohio State University and the north 
          side of Columbus. The leading figures who began the group continued 
          to set direction through counsel and personal influence rather than 
          through leadership offices. From the beginning Xenos leaders encouraged 
          individual Bible teachers and evangelists to start home study groups 
          as they were able, sharing knowledge informally. By 1974, the fellowship 
          consisted of a dozen different groups comprising more than 200 people. 
        </p>

          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>During this period, the group's theology was influenced most by four 
          strangely contradictory sources: Francis Schaeffer and the L'Abri group, 
          Plymouth Brethren teaching as typified by authors like T. Austin Sparks 
          and Miles Stanford, grace-oriented Bible commentary like that of William 
          R. Newell and Watchman Nee. Yet, such eclectic approaches were common 
          in the milieu of the Jesus revolution, which was in full swing in those 
          years. The theological emphases they gleaned from these authors were: 
          (1) The centrality of the grace of God 2) The importance of learning 
          Christian truth content--including the Bible, theology, church history 
          and contemporary social criticism. (3) The importance of staying in 
          touch with contemporary culture. (4) The importance of developing deep 
          Christian community, including a network of relationships that are not 
          superficial. </p>

        </table>
        <p>Xenos leaders often attended Bible studies taught by former Campus 
          Crusade staffers, Gordon Walker and Ray Nethery. These men were instrumental 
          in the early equipping of Xenos leaders and Xenos enjoyed an alliance 
          with groups in town these men had founded. But when Walker and Nethery 
          joined a larger group and moved in a different direction theologically 
          in 1974, Xenos leaders broke with them and the associated groups in 
          our area. Nethery later also broke with the group, which eventually 
          became convinced that the Eastern Orthodox tradition is the truest expression 
          of the Body of Christ. Today they have become Eastern Orthodox priests, 
          while Xenos has continued to develop the ideals they taught earlier, 
          including a return to primitive Christianity as seen in the New Testament. 
        </p>
        <p>After struggling with whether the interpretive community of the post-apostolic 
          fathers should be considered authoritative today, Xenos leaders finally 
          and definitely settled on a view that church tradition should have no 
          authority whatsoever in the life of the church. They concluded that 
          all authority accorded tradition is at the direct expense of biblical 
          authority. Although these same leaders later got graduate degrees in 
          historical theology, they have come to see the history of interpretation 
          as important for comparison, but in no way determinative in understanding 
          the Bible. The incident had the effect of confirming Xenos' radically 
          non-traditional path. Xenos teachers continue to see human tradition 
          as more often the enemy of good exegesis than a help. While recognizing 
          that no group is without traditions, we see all human tradition, including 
          our own, as carrying the dangerous potential of becoming an idol&#151;a 
          familiar pattern of thought and practice to which people often will 
          cling, even if it means defying God's will and causing lost people to 
          stay lost. </p>
        <p><img src="graphics/compass.gif" width="220" height="150" align="right" />At that time, several leaders, including the two main teachers for 
          the group, McCallum and DeLashmutt, decided to seek formal graduate 
          study. They went to Los Angeles where they studied for two years at 
          Christian Associates Seminary, an unaccredited seminary specializing 
          in training leaders of &quot;street-oriented&quot; ministries. Most 
          of the seminary's faculty had been Campus Crusade staffers earlier in 
          their careers.</p>

        </table>
        <p>Upon returning to Columbus in 1976, the group from California joined 
          those leaders who had remained behind to take up leadership of the now 
          smaller group of about 60 students. An eldership was elected and they 
          set about starting new home Bible study groups, some for students and 
          some for adults. McCallum's mother, Martha, had been active in teaching 
          home Bible studies for several years and was instrumental in starting 
          several groups. </p>
        <table width="120" align="left">
          <tr>

          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Xenos leadership had clarified their vision for the church during their 
          time of study in California, settling on the central values that continue 
          to characterize Xenos to this day: That the church is people in community, 
          actively growing through using their gifts in ministry and reaching 
          out to those outside the church. The group shared a dread of shallowness, 
          of outward &quot;churchy&quot; piety, and of formalism. McCallum and
          DeLashmutt envisioned a radically involved church where everyone took
          part in ministry, virtually erasing the usual clergy-laity distinction
          in western Christianity. They saw the importance of keeping the church
          outward focused, and sought to avoid what they perceived as a tendency
          in the American church to be inward-focused and out of touch with contemporary
          culture. Evangelism and personal discipleship were the means for building
          the church. In Xenos, all leaders sought to disciple
        younger believers, and that was supposed to lead to duplication. Duplication
        of mature Christians would hopefully lead to duplication of house churches.
        And as house churches multiplied, a church planting movement would erupt.
        To the present day, Xenos strives to be a church planting movement.</p>
        <table width="150" align="right">
          <tr> 
            <td height="81"><h4>By 1980, the group had grown to more than 400 
                adults.</h4></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Very quickly, people were attracted to the Bible studies they started.
           By 1980, the group had grown to more than 500 adults. During this
          entire 
          period, all leadership participated on a volunteer basis. McCallum,
           DeLashmutt and many other teachers made their livings as house painters.
          
          That year, the group decided to open a bank account so they could lease
           space for their meetings. They leased 9,000 square feet in an office-warehouse&#151;a
            venue unimaginatively dubbed &quot;Building 4,&quot; from its name
            in  the complex. Others called it &quot;The Warehouse.&quot; Not
            until 1981  did Xenos hire its first paid staff, as McCallum and
            DeLashmutt were 
          placed on part-time salary. By now the church had grown to nearly 800
             members. During the decade in which there were no paid leaders in
            the 
          church, Xenos members developed deep convictions about lay ministry.
             To this day, Xenos members shoulder the bulk of ministry including
            extensive 
          training. Xenos leaders are convinced that without the many years of
             serving as soldiers at their own expense, they never would have
            been 
          able to develop the same level of certainty about the equality of all
             members' responsibility for ministry. </p>
        <p><img src="graphics/xenmag.png" alt="Xenos Magazine" width="250" height="212" align="right" />When 
          it became evident that &quot;The Fish House Fellowship&quot; was becoming 
          a large church, the leadership decided to incorporate the church under 
          Ohio law. The group had been publishing a magazine called <em>Xenos 
          Magazine</em>, and they decided to call the new corporation Xenos Christian 
          Fellowship. The name <em>Xenos</em> is derived from a Greek word whose 
          primary use in the New Testament denotes sojourners in a foreign land, 
          a biblical description of Christians whose ultimate home is in heaven. 
          A secondary usage of the word <em>xenos</em> denotes &quot;one who provides 
          hospitality.&quot; 
        </p><p>From the beginning, Xenos has strived to reach not only unchurched 
          people, but anti-church people&#151;those who are determined to stay 
          away from more traditional churches. This is why Xenos reaches out with 
          the message of Christ in an unconventional, contemporary, informal setting. 
          Visitors from other churches are often confused and even startled by 
          how different Xenos meetings are from other churches. We don't feel 
          we are trying to be strange as an end in itself, but for <a href="strange.htm">reasons 
          that arise out of our unique calling</a>.</p>
        <h3>Rapid Growth </h3>
        <p>As the home Bible studies, or &quot;home churches&quot; multiplied 
          and spread throughout the city, they became increasingly successful 
          at reaching not only students, but also people in their 30s, 40s, and 
          50s. Xenos leaders increasingly sensed the potential of a self-replicating 
          house-church movement for reaching the lost. The leadership team in 
          each house church sets as its goal from the beginning to raise up new 
          leadership and plant a new home church. </p>
        <p>In addition to home groups, McCallum and DeLashmutt each led a so-called &quot;<a href="../ministries/ct/ct.htm">Central Teaching</a>.&quot; 
          The Central Teachings were labeled &quot;central&quot; because clusters
          of home groups would share space at these lectures. One Central Teaching
          was comprised mainly of students, the other mainly adults. </p>
        <p>During the 1980s, the church also developed a fairly elaborate system 
          of <a href="../classes/index.htm">coursework </a>intended to support 
          home church leaders in their efforts to raise up qualified new leaders. 
          Every quarter, hundreds of people would take courses, most of which 
          met for two- to three-hour sessions every Wednesday evening. The courses 
          generally charged tuition of $30 to $50, assigned homework, and gave 
          graded quizzes and tests. Students had to pass a minimum list of courses 
          in order to qualify as a home church leader. </p>
        <p>Between 1980 and 1984, the number of participants in home churches 
          doubled every 18 months. By then, the total number of participants had 
          reached 2,050. Concurrently, the number of lay leaders rose from 50 
          in 1980 to more than 200 in 1984. The two Central Teachings grew accordingly. 
          We added a third Central Teaching in 1986, a fourth in 1988.</p>
        <h3>A Different Decade </h3>
        <p>By 1991, Xenos had grown to more than 3,500 people. Because of the
           hundreds of children now involved, the &quot;Warehouse&quot; no longer
            could meet the group's needs. The elders made the decision that the
           
          church needed to build a facility to house the increasingly complicated
            ministry of the church.</p>
        <p>As the church searched for a suitable site that would not limit future
           growth, the membership had to face several grave issues, including
          our 
          longtime tradition of weak giving to the local church. Although Xenos
           members had a strong ethic of self-sacrifice, giving had never been
          strong. 
          Xenos meetings never passed the plate, but merely referred to a box
           in the rear where people could leave donations. Our annual budget
          was 
          barely over $1 million with attendance of 3500! To the displeasure
           of some, the leaders began taking formal collections, and organized
          
          a pledge system and a <a href="../classes/papers/fst.htm">fiscal support
           team</a> to take the lead in fiscal matters. Today, the church gives
           nearly five times per capita what they did then.</p>
        <p>During the early 90's Xenos underwent internal
          upheaval, eventually resulting in our first large-scale church division.
          The
          causes for
          the 
          division were complicated, involving some interpersonal, affective
          conflict. But the differences also included important issues of substance.
          Many
          
          members came to distrust some elders, who were taking the church
          in  new directions but were unable to reach their goals, such as erecting
          
          the new facility. Some members interpreted this failure as a sign that
           God's power had departed from the leadership of the church. The introduction
          
          of new features like formal pledges and collections were also seen
          by  some as a sellout of the original Xenos vision. </p>
        <p><img src="graphics/buildmix.gif" width="300" height="219" align="right" />In addition to these problems, the leadership of the church was divided 
          over issues of doctrine and practice. A group of leaders and counselors 
          in the church were increasingly involved in victim advocacy, including 
          recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse, occult ritual sexual abuse, 
          and an emphasis on the emotional lives of Christians, as over against 
          what was pejoratively called a &quot;functional approach&quot; to Christian 
          living. Some leaders were calling for an approach to Christian leadership 
          that the elders felt would exclude leaders' ability to call for a high 
          level of commitment even when some members felt marginalized by such 
          calls. During a colloquium scheduled by the elders to voice views on 
          these issues, the different sides in the dispute wrote papers and debated 
          their views. A large meeting of the whole church followed where leaders 
          and elders presented their areas of agreement and disagreement. But 
          none of these measures resulted in a resolution to the growing conflict 
          over the future vision for the church. </p>
        <p>This dispute also correlated with the rise of the so-called Toronto
           blessing. Some Xenos members were caught up in related area conferences
          and urged other members to join in. Xenos elders decided this revival
          reflected extremist views and practices that had no place in Xenos
          Fellowship,
          and went
          on record
        publicly with their criticisms to the dismay of many members.</p>
        <p>To add to the confusion, Xenos elders picked this time to completely 
          reorganize the church! Home fellowship groups were diversified and the 
          ministry was divided into five divisions. Full-time administrators were 
          hired to take over the bulk of administrative burden. Such sudden change 
          added to the impression that the leaders of the church were lurching 
          away from the church's historic approach, where everything was handled 
          in an informal and rather disorganized way. </p>
        <p>As dissent in the church reached a crescendo in 1993, there were calls
          for founder, Dennis McCallum, to resign. He and the other elders met
          to discuss whether they were somehow in the wrong for their direction,
          or whether the problem was more the result of a negative attitude toward
          human leadership in general. </p>
        <p>Finally, the elders decided to &quot;have
          it out&quot; with the dissident group in the church. At a meeting of
          all church leaders and their spouses (about 500 people) they announced
          there would be a debate on the suitability of our current elders to
          lead the church. They urged everyone to bring their suspicions and
          complaints out in public, and after three hours of debate, the group
          would vote on whether to keep or remove each existing elder. Instead,
          the debate began at 9:00 A.M. and lasted until 5:00 P.M. without a
          break! After heated exchanges, complete with accusations and counter-accusations,
          the leaders
          voted. All existing elders were retained by margins of not less than
          85%. Two-thirds majority had been required to pass.</p>
        <p>After the referendum, Xenos elders decided to authorize McCallum
          to set in writing his <a href="../essays/vision.htm">vision for the
          church</a>.
            After revisions by the rest of the elders, they presented the paper
            to a meeting of the combined leadership and called for a vote of
            affirmation
            from the majority. The paper established a <a href="../admin/steam.htm">Servant
             Team</a> with new restrictions and requirements for leaders in the
            church. The paper was affirmed by 85 percent of the 350 leaders and
            staff, much
            to the dismay of a vocal minority. </p>
        <p>People began to leave. During 1993 and 1994, more than 1,400 people
           left the church. The church, now down to 2,100 in attendance, went
          through 
          a period of recovery as members sought to recover our earlier focus
           as a cell-based church. Within two years, the church again began to
          
          grow, and today about 5000 people attend our meetings.
          The changes in the Servant Team have proven to be a great success,
          and
          today, the team numbers more than 800 members. </p>
        <p><img src="graphics/Xenoscampus.png" alt="The Xenos campus today" width="250" height="92" hspace="10" align="left" class="block" />Notwithstanding 
          the chaos of those years, we find ourselves today happy with the organization 
          and tone of the church, and we feel we are headed for a great future. 
          We succeeded in erecting our facility in 1997, and have seen excellent 
          growth and morale in the church as a result. </p>
        <h3>Our Ministry Today</h3>
        <p>Aside from our numerous home fellowship groups, Xenos conducts ministry 
          through <a href="../admin/minteam.htm">ministry teams</a>. These teams 
          go through an accreditation process after developing a defined ministry 
          plan. Some of the key ministry teams in the church include: </p>
        <h4><a href="../homegroups/index.htm">Home Groups</a></h4>
        <p>&quot;Home churches,&quot; are the backbone of Xenos home group ministry. 
          These groups usually range from 15-60 people who meet for fellowship 
          and Bible teaching. Home churches are also open to non-Christian neighbors 
          and friends, and are a major entry point for new people into the church. 
          Each home church also has a discipleship program involving men's and 
          women's groups and supervised ministry experience, usually combined 
          with some one-on-one mentoring. By the end of a typical three-year cycle, 
          the leadership team of a given home church tries to have a new leadership 
          team in place, along with new members and discipleship groups. When 
          everything is ready, the group has a harvest meeting where testimonies 
          are shared, and the group divides to plant a new home church.</p>
        <h4> <strong><a href="../admin/equip.htm">Training</a></strong></h4>
        <p>In the mid-1970s, Xenos began offering courses for those wanting to 
          expand their knowledge of the Bible and ministry skills. Today, we offer 
          one series of courses that revolve around leadership training and another 
          that focuses on introductory information aimed at young Christians and 
          those investigating Christianity. </p>
        <p>Our <a href="../classes/index.htm">courses</a> address theology, biblical 
          studies, counseling, family life, and other subjects of interest to 
          members. Xenos has developed much of its own curricula, which is regularly 
          taught by the church's pastors and other trained teachers and professionals. 
        </p>
        <p>The <a href="../ministries/studycenter/index.htm">Study Center</a>, 
          is Xenos' lending library and place to prepare for leading home group. 
          The center offers a unique place to study, set in a wooded ravine with 
          a deck and stream. We maintain an extensive audio and video tape library, 
          in addition to thousands of books that address Christianity and related 
          disciplines from a variety of perspectives. Our index of Study Center 
          resources are computerized for quick access, and most books are available 
          for loan.</p>
        <h4><a href="../admin/evang.htm">Adult Outreach </a></h4>
        <p>Most of our adult outreach occurs at the ever-popular public lectures 
          we call Central Teachings. We also see big results from innovative outreach 
          projects such as <a href="../ministries/justforfun/playgroups.htm">Play 
          Groups</a> and <a href="../ministries/justforfun/cc1.htm">Conversation 
          and Cuisine</a> groups. </p>
        <p>Xenos began as a student movement, but during the 1980s, the student 
          component in the church gradually decreased. During the '90s, the church 
          launched a determined effort to recover our voice with secondary and 
          college students in our area. The campaign has been successful, as students 
          in this age range increased from under 200 to around 1,000 by 2004. 
        </p>
        <h4><a href="../admin/studnt.htm"><strong>Student Ministries</strong></a></h4>
        <p>For younger kids, <a href="www.xenosschools.org">Xenos Christian Schools</a> 
          has three locations in Columbus, Ohio, offering quality academic and 
          biblical education. <br />
          Calumet Christian School, founded in 1983 by Xenos Christian Fellowship, 
          includes preschool through grade 8; Xenos Christian School, started 
          in 1997, offers preschool through grade 5; Harambee Christian School, 
          our urban program, opened in 1998 with full-day kindergarten, and now 
          has classes through grade 5. </p>
        <p>Our popular children's ministry operating during Central Teachings 
          is called <a href="../ministries/oasis/index.htm">Oasis</a>. Leaders 
          of this ministry have written their own curriculum, available on this 
          site. </p>
        <h4><a href="../admin/extrel.htm">External Relations</a></h4>
        <p>Xenos' External Relations division forges relationships with other 
          churches to explore cooperative ministries and ways to share resources. 
          This division also enhances the community's understanding of Xenos and 
          demonstrates unity among Christians. We offer conferences for the larger 
          church in our area and maintain this web site. Xenos also maintains 
          membership in interdenominational missions networks, such as the Association 
          of Church Missions Committees. </p>
        <h4><a href="http://urbanconcern.org">Urban Concern</a></h4>
        <p>Xenos is strong in the conviction that God has given us blessing only 
          so we can share his love with others in need. In 1991 we launched Urban 
          Concern with the mission of transforming one of the most disadvantaged 
          neighborhoods in Columbus. </p>
        <p>Urban Concern seeks to empower individuals and families to be agents of positive change in South Linden and the world. Our strategy is to raise up indigenous leadership in a targeted area of Columbus. We accomplish this 
          mission through various activities, including a private inner city school, 
          an after school program, spiritual mentoring, 
          job training, community development activities, and more.</p>
        <h4> <a href="../ministries/missions/worldmin.htm"><strong>World Ministries 
          </strong></a> </h4>
        <p>World Ministries provide opportunities for every Christian to be involved 
          in evangelism and the establishment of churches among non-Christian 
          peoples around the world. Today, Xenos has planted teams in Southeast 
          Asia, Eastern Europe, Taiwan and Cambodia.</p>
        <p>The <a href="/missions/mobilization">Missions Mobilization</a> 
          department educates and mobilizes Xenos members for worldwide evangelism.</p>
        <p>Volunteers also coordinate <a href="../ministries/missions/hsupport.htm">Home 
          Support Teams</a>, who are dedicated to supporting the needs of our 
          mission fields.</p>

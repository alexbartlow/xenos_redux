<p><a name="top" id="top2"></a>Some observers have noted that Xenos is unusual. We agree.  Our observations of other churches indicate that we are different than most  churches in quite a few ways. Some are central; others are fairly peripheral.  Of course every group has its idiosyncrasies, but Xenos seems stranger than  usual. Why do we feel the need to do things differently?</p>
<p>That depends. Xenos didn't come out of an existing church, so we had no  tradition to serve. And we realize that other churches have approaches that may  be just as good or even better than ours. We have agreed we don't want to be  different just to be different. But at the same time, we find that these  differences are a good way to understand the thinking and values behind Xenos. </p>
<p>For each feature, click to read a short explanation of what the difference  is, and why we do it that way. Please note that we don't claim other churches  should be like us. We learn from other churches all the time, and appreciate  that there are more than one way to skin a cat!</p>
<h4><strong>Explanations</strong></h4>
<h3><strong><a name="involve" id="involve"></a>Involvement in home church</strong></h3>
<p>At Xenos, virtually everyone attends a home church. Attendance at home  church is more than 30% higher than large meetings. Historically, home meetings  came before large meetings for us, and still today, they are considered more  important.</p>
<h3><strong><a name="leadership" id="leadership"></a>Home group leadership training</strong></h3>
<p>How churches manage to train competent leaders during a one- to eight-week  training program is a complete mystery to us at Xenos. Our training program  takes several years of classroom and field training. Part of this training  takes place while within leadership and part before. Our typical leader has  completed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>190 hours of classroom       instruction with homework and graded exams; </li>
  <li>Two to five years of personal       mentoring from an older believer </li>
  <li>Have either won       non-Christians to Christ, or at least brought people who were converted </li>
  <li>Have won one or more       individuals into a personal discipleship relationship; </li>
  <li>Have a proven character like <a href="/classes/um1-4.htm">that required for deacons</a> in 1 Tim. 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do we call for such a high level of <a href="/teachings/?series=72">training  for leaders</a>?</p>
<p>First, Xenos home group leaders are responsible for leading and caring for  groups that typically range from 15 to 60 people. These groups are &quot;home  churches,&quot; <a href="/aboutxenos/strange.htm#3level">not  cell groups like in many churches</a>. A home church is a medium-sized group  with a team of leaders. Since each home church takes care of its own leadership  training, evangelism, pastoral work, teaching, worship, etc., we believe  leaders need to be competent spiritual ministers (deacons) who are well-trained  and capable of some sophistication. When you think about what leaders have to  do, you see why:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We expect our leaders to       motivate their people biblically, which entails not just relying on       group-think or sociological pressure, but actually persuading members that       a biblical lifestyle is the way to live. </li>
  <li>Such persuasion implies       leaders know the Bible well enough to be persuasive in all major areas of       Christian teaching. </li>
  <li>Our leaders have to be       prepared to answer questions about all areas of Christian teaching and       thought. </li>
  <li>They have to be prepared to       lead their home church in waging spiritual warfare, so they must know       about Satan and how to avoid aberrant teaching in this area. </li>
  <li>They need to be competent to       counsel people through typical non-clinical problems. </li>
  <li>They have to conform to the       character requirements of deacons as detailed in Scripture, which often       entails some years of growth. </li>
  <li>In most cases, they have to       be mature enough to work on a leadership team without competing or       fighting. </li>
  <li>They have to be able to train       their upcoming leaders in evangelism, follow-up, discipleship, pastoral       work, Bible teaching, etc. This implies they know these areas themselves. </li>
  <li>They have to serve as models       of Christian living. In other words, their own lives must be stable and       their relationships (including marriages) should be basically healthy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering what leaders need to be able to do, we doubt anyone could  develop good leaders in a few weeks or even a few months. In fact, we think one  of the reasons churches are reluctant to fully delegate true responsibility to  their lay leaders is their insufficient training. They know intuitively they  can't trust their under-trained leaders with sophisticated ministry because  they are incompetent. But if this is true, who's fault is it?<a href="/aboutxenos/strange.htm#top"><br />

<h3><strong><a name="minhouse" id="minhouse"></a>Ministry Houses</strong></h3>
<p>Xenos singles live in over 100 rooming houses dedicated to discipleship and  evangelism. These houses typically have five to 12 men or women (but not both)  living in them. The members subscribe to a <a href="/ministries/college/minhouseagmt.htm">ministry house covenant</a>,  which is an agreement to be accountable to their room mates for involvement and  basic Christian living. During our history, ministry houses have been  exceptionally effective at developing leaders in Xenos. They also cooperate  with their respective home churches in outreach projects and parties. Single  Christians in Xenos commonly live in a ministry house for several years. <a href="/ministries/college/minhouse.htm">College home  churches</a> all operate two to four houses each, and the overwhelming majority  of college members live in ministry houses. Adult home churches also sometimes have  ministry houses for their singles.</p>
<p>Ministry houses have proven to be a superb alternative to sending kids to  Christian colleges. At Xenos, we have been very disappointed with the fruit  born at Christian colleges, where students constantly surrounded with  Christians seem to begin viewing Christianity as ho-hum. These students  commonly come back spouting doctrinal trivia, but with no idea how to witness  or relate to the real world.</p>
<p>We also notice kids sent to secular universities without the support of a  strong Christian community usually lose their spiritual vigor or worse. With  ministry houses, kids get personal support and real community strong enough to  counteract the powerful draw of our culture. At the same time, they venture  into the secular world every day where they have to fight for their faith, and  that leads to strength and realism in their walks.<br />

<h3><strong><a name="giving" id="giving"></a><a name="converts" id="converts"></a><a name="elderlimit" id="elderlimit"></a>Elders  Limited in Income and Assets</strong></h3>
<p>Some of the <a href="/aboutxenos/leaders.htm">elders at  Xenos</a> work full-time for the church, some part time, and others in secular  careers. But they have all agreed to limit their incomes and assets, whether  from the church or from other sources, including spouses' incomes. Our reason?  First, we believe materialistic avarice is the curse of American society, often  including the American church. As elders, we want to set an example for the  church that says we can live at the need level, not at the greed level. Notice  Paul did this by working hard and living simple in Thessalonica. &quot;We did  this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to make  ourselves a model for you to follow.&quot; (2 Thess. 3:9) </p>
<p>The level to which elders' incomes are limited is very comfortable so this  is hardly asceticism!</p>
<p>We also observe that many churches are controlled by the wealthy, and are  insensitive to the poor and even to students. When wealthy people get the  church to commit to expensive options, the church ends up in debt and even more  beholden to the wealthy. </p>
<p>For a number of reasons, we feel it's good for elders to live at an income  level similar to, or below most of our membership. Wealth can easily develop  into an attraction that competes with the Lord for our attention. We want only  elders who would gladly disown their wealth in order to have the opportunity to  serve God. Those who refuse to divest themselves may be signaling a problem. We  want our elders to have their attention focused on spiritual matters, not on  the playthings of the wealthy.</p>
<p>Not only elders' incomes, but also their assets, come under scrutiny. In  American culture, it is not unusual for adults to receive an inheritance from a  wealthy relative that could unbalance their lives. A man or woman who hardly  thought about money before, may become fascinated by money after receiving a  million dollar inheritance. Therefore, we call on elders to disclose their  assets, and if they are excessive (beyond a home and some modest savings or  retirement), we agree to divest ourselves of the excess.</p>
<p>Although we feel our policy on this matter is somewhat soft, we think it is  in general harmony with 2 Tim. 2:3,4, where Paul urges Timothy, &quot;Suffer  hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. No soldier in active  service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so that he may  please the one who enlisted him as a soldier.&quot;</p>
<p>On more than one occasion, the elders' limited income and assets have served  to dissuade would-be elders from joining the board.</p>

<h3><strong><a name="worship" id="worship"></a>No Worship Services</strong></h3>
<p>Visitors to Xenos are always amazed (and often appalled) that we don't  conduct worship services. This often leads to the commonly heard question,  &quot;Why doesn't Xenos worship?&quot; Xenos leaders are never happy to hear  this question, since it signals a misunderstanding. We certainly do worship the  Lord! The problem is that the modern Western church has a very specific  understanding of what worship is, and visitors do not find that particular form  of worship at Xenos. </p>
<p>Xenos leaders are not convinced the New Testament supports the modern  American concept of the &quot;worship service.&quot; The early church had large  meetings as well as home church meetings (Acts 2, 22). However, as we have  studied these and related passages, we do not believe these large meetings were  for the purpose of corporate worship, at least not as we see it in America today,  with music, choirs, liturgy, etc. The descriptions of these large meetings  never mention worship as their goal. Instead, they appear to be meetings for  teaching and evangelism. Some forms of worship, including hymns, revelations,  and tongues, were practiced at the home group meetings, according to 1 Cor.  14:26. This suggests to us that <a href="/homegroups/worship.htm">home groups are the best  place for group worship</a> in song. </p>
<p>At a deeper level, we believe the modern church's idea of a worship service  is based on the <a href="/classes/um1-1.htm">Old Testament  concept</a> of temple service, and in this sense is misleading. We believe the <a href="/classes/um2-2.htm">New Testament teaches that  worship</a> is something we do <a href="/teachings/?teaching=1417">all the time</a>,  through at least five different modalities, of which singing is only one.  Others specifically mentioned in the New Testament (using worship terminology)  are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Financial giving (Heb. 13:16; Phil. 4:18)</li>
  <li>Evangelism (Rom. 15:15,16) </li>
  <li>Works of service (Heb. 13:16) </li>
  <li>Praise through prayer (Heb. 13:15) </li>
  <li>Devoting your whole life to       Christ (Rom.       12:1).</li>
</ul>
<p>Xenos charges home churches with the mission of corporate worship. Our large  meetings are for teaching and for outreach to non-Christians. Some home  churches worship in song, and some just worship in prayer. Celebrating <a href="/teachings/?teaching=316">communion</a> and baptisms are also handled by home churches. The approach is up to each  group. See a <a href="/teachings/?teaching=2136">central  teaching outline</a> or <a href="/teachings/?teaching=316">view a  RealMedia presentation</a> on this topic.</p>
<p>Our approach to this issue has had an interesting and unintended result.  Christian visitors visiting Xenos are often dismayed to learn the worship  services they are used to are not available in our church. Some also miss the  cross, altar, and other forms of iconography in our auditorium. As a result,  many of these visitors leave Xenos for a church more in line with their  expectations. As those who long for a church worship service move on, they open  up space for those in our field of outreach who are delighted they don't have  to sing Christian songs at our big meetings. Over the years, this filter has contributed  to the high percentage of converts at Xenos.<br />
  <a href="/aboutxenos/strange.htm#top"></a><a href="/admin/unsimilarform.htm"></a></p>
<h3><strong><a name="weddings" id="weddings"></a>Home group leaders handle all weddings, visitations  and funerals</strong></h3>
<p>In most churches, the staff handles functions such as these. In order to  marry members, home church leaders have to be ordained by the church, and this  is something most churches are reluctant to do. Churches don't want to  proliferate ordained pastors who may not be well qualified. This, of course,  leads to the conclusion mentioned earlier: that we must hold <a href="/aboutxenos/strange.htm#leadership">higher  qualifications for our home church leaders</a>. </p>
<p>At Xenos, we not only allow home church leaders to carry out these functions  with their members, we require it. If a couple approached one of the senior  elders and asked to be married, we would point out that they need to ask their  home church leaders to marry them. In a church where scores of marriages may  occur every year, our top leaders would be unable to do much besides marry  people every weekend if not for this policy. Visitation of the sick would  require even more hours for the pastoral staff. </p>
<p>At Xenos, sick people are visited and counseled by people in their home  churches. This frees up more time for discipleship and equipping. Our elders  consider this one of the really important features of Xenos, opening the door  to lay ministry in a number of ways.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Return to the List</a><br />
  <a href="/aboutxenos/strange.htm#top"></a><a href="/admin/unsimilarform.htm"></a></p>
<h3><strong><a name="homegrpstaff" id="homegrpstaff"></a>All staff and eldership required to be in a home  group</strong></h3>
<p>This is certainly not unique, but in our experience, it is relatively  unusual. Particularly important to us is that our top leadership is fully  involved and actually lead home churches. When consulting with churches  interested in building their home group networks, we often find that the senior  pastor and others aren't in a home group for a variety of reasons, and have no  intention of joining one. We find it unlikely that such churches will succeed  in building high-caliber home-based body life. </p>
<p>For one thing, if the top leadership isn't on board with the home group idea,  how likely is it that the church will see this as a central issue? People will  quickly draw the conclusion that community of this kind must not be essential  for spiritual health, because what's good for the goose is apparently not good  for the gander. </p>
<p>We think it is important that those on staff for pastoral counseling be  leaders of home groups. This is because we have noticed a tendency in those  involved in healing ministries to discount the importance of mission and  leadership unless they are themselves vitally involved as leaders. Finally, top  leaders who aren't involved weekly in personal discipleship and motivating a  home group will not be drawing their illustrations and lessons from that  experience set. We want our leaders to regularly relate what they are learning  in their groups when teaching and speaking.</p>
<p>We also believe the realities of group leadership and personal discipleship  often bring to light the truth about Christian leaders' lives. We have seen  repeatedly that when a Christian leader begins to develop a personal spiritual  problem, it comes to light first in that person's home group. Likewise, leaders  who are drifting into negative territory spiritually are usually the first to  begin to downplay the importance of home fellowship ministry, discipleship and  personal evangelism. Large-group preaching can be ego-enhancing, but personal discipleship  is quiet and obscure background work. That's another reason we consider  effective discipleship to be a prerequisite to public ministry. </p>
<p>Finally, we want our paid staff to live the same struggle the rest of our  leaders do: balancing career, family and volunteer ministry.<br />

<h3><strong><a name="discipline" id="discipline"></a>Home group leaders handle church discipline</strong></h3>
<p>Xenos home churches are like real churches. They carry out all the  ministries a normal church would, including all the normal leadership  functions. The only difference is that these leaders work under the oversight  of our board of elders. Therefore, pastoral problems including those requiring  discipline normally come up in the home church.</p>
<p>We expect leaders in these groups to initiate discipline along the lines of  Mat. 18. If a case reaches the extreme of exclusion from fellowship, the home  church leaders are expected to recommend such action to the elders. The elders  and oversight staff will review the case and must agree with the discipline  proposed in advance, but the home church leaders will carry out the discipline. </p>
<p>Normally, if the first several attempts to bring change have failed, a  meeting is scheduled for committed members of the home group where the errant  member can be confronted and admonished by the church. Group members have to be  counseled and prepared for an experience so foreign to modern individualistic  society. Leaders have to chair the meeting, making sure the tone is loving but  firm. They have to make sure <a href="/classes/leadership/appdis.html">Xenos policy</a> and <a href="/classes/leadership/discip.html">biblical  standards</a> are followed. </p>
<p>All of these functions require considerable maturity and good judgment on  the part of home group leaders, arguing for thorough training.</p>

<h3><strong><a name="hiring" id="hiring"></a>Staff hiring mostly limited to members</strong></h3>
<p>At Xenos, we hire all our staff from within the church. We don't consider  this to be a biblical mandate, and for that matter, we could hire from outside  if the need was great, just as they did in Antioch when Barnabas went to get Paul (Acts  11:25ff). However, we feel we should prefer hiring within the church because of  the message conveyed to the church. What will our people conclude if, every  time we need a highly qualified leader, we look out to the job market rather  than to our own people? Doesn't this suggest they are qualified to lead and  serve unless it's a high-level position; but in that case, we have to hire a  pro from outside?</p>
<p>Another reason for hiring only members is that people need to know those  their leaders. If a person comes from outside, how do the &quot;sheep know his  voice,&quot; to paraphrase Jesus' words. We find it hard to see how a community  can feel confidence in a person they don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We know other churches often hire from within, and some even hire <em>most</em> positions from within. But we feel we should hire <em>all</em> positions from  within. If we feel some positions are so sophisticated that they require  graduate degrees, we should challenge members to get those degrees. If the  church is charged with equipping the saints for the work of ministry, we  believe we should not go outside the local church for ministers except in very  unusual circumstances, probably involving extraordinary growth too rapid to  allow internal equipping.<br />

<h3><strong><a name="content" id="content2"></a><a name="3level" id="3level"></a>Three-level structure instead of two</strong></h3>
<p>Most cell-based churches in America  today have a two-level structure. The large meetings are the corporate worship  meetings, and the small meetings are the cell groups, small groups, life  groups, or similar. Small groups are usually six to 15 adults. Some churches  have their small groups limited to believers only. Others welcome new people.  But we have talked to a number of leaders who find themselves torn with this  arrangement. Some worry their believer-only small groups will turn inward and  lose interest in outreach. The small groups could become Bible clubs for  Christians, or &quot;holy huddles.&quot; Others worry that because their small  groups are always geared toward new people, there are no meetings in the life  of their church devoted to discipleship, deep learning, and transparent sharing.</p>
<p>At Xenos, most groups have a three-level structure. We have our big meetings  like other churches, although they are <a href="/aboutxenos/strange.htm#worship">not worship services</a>.  We also have home churches, which are groups of 15 to 60 adults. Home churches  are open to non-Christian guests, and are really small communities. Within each  home church there are typically two or more <a href="/classes/leadership/cellmod.htm">cell groups</a>. Our  cell groups are usually six to 18 men or women only. The men's or women's cell  groups are for believers only, and usually have a fairly aggressive study  schedule. They share and pray for each other as well. These are groups devoted  to discipleship, friendship building, and spiritual growth.</p>
<p>Thus, with our three-level structure, we have home group meetings devoted to  outreach as well as some devoted to growth. For many groups, this means a third  meeting each week. Other groups alternate the home church and the cell group  meetings. We find that our three-level structure addresses all the needs in the  church in a way no two-level structure is likely to do. We have experimented  with two-level approaches on several occasions, but our leaders feel the  results were poor.</p>

<h3><strong><a name="planters" id="planters"></a>Home church planting is a prerequisite for high  leadership roles</strong></h3>
<p>Selecting good leaders is always difficult, and it's important, since the  quality of any church is not likely to be higher than the quality of it's top  leaders. We have observed many churches come under deficient leadership at  times, and we want to avoid that. To select good leaders, we begin by <a href="/aboutxenos/strange.htm#hiring">limiting our search</a> to our own church. This way, we know the person we are hiring and aren't  dependent on secondhand reports from other groups. We try to get people with  proven character as the top requirement. Then too, we find that for top  staff—those directly involved in leading large sections of the church—we want leaders  who are successful church planters.</p>
<p>Planting home churches in Xenos is very difficult. Home church leaders not  only have to take care of a group of 25 or more people, they have to promote  evangelism, train new leaders and provide field experience for their new  leaders. They have to develop, not just a leader, but a balanced team of  leaders and a following to go with the new team. The group grows to 35-45  people, mostly through conversion. All of this takes some years of work and  sacrifice. If the new church plant fails, they come right back to the planting  church—this makes weak church planting a waste of time.</p>
<p>We find the challenge of home church planting is so tough that only quality  leaders with a fair amount of experience are able to pull it off. In Xenos,  everyone respects successful church planters as those who know what they are  talking about when it comes to ministry. That's why we select successful  planters as home church coaches, course teachers, elders and other high-profile  roles. It's great to be able to pick from those who have repeatedly  accomplished a task we are all familiar with. We don't have to wonder how good  such leaders are!<br />
</p>
<h3><strong><a name="uc" id="uc"></a>High commitment to urban community development ministry</strong></h3>
<p>Xenos is very heavily committed to Christian community development. Urban  Concern, City Light, and Renegade are efforts to reach the inner city in Columbus, and to  eventually transform neighborhoods through the love of Christ.</p>
<p>The strategy is to focus on children, and stay with them over a 10 to  20-year period, hopefully raising up indigenous leaders.</p>
<p>We focus on both spiritual development and educational/vocational  development. Over 20 full-time staff and hundreds of volunteers work in this  ministry which operates an after-school program, an inner-city school, job  training programs, Bible studies and church planting. Our inner city school has  demonstrated improvement in student SAT  scores from the 20th percentile typical of that part of town to a startling  60th percentile performance! These kids are in great position to break the  cycle of poverty. </p>
<p>Xenos is mainly a church-planting ministry, but we believe the Bible also  charges those with money to <a href="/classes/um2-10.htm">care  for the poor</a>. Not only do we believe we should care for the poor, but we  also should invest in long-term change as opposed to handouts and short term  relief.</p>

<h3><strong><a name="missions" id="missions"></a><a name="leaderteams" id="leaderteams"></a>Leadership Teams in Xenos</strong></h3>
<p>In the New Testament, <a href="/classes/um1-2.htm">eldership</a> is always plural. The accountability of collective leadership is an important  control that we believe God prescribes because of the fundamental  untrustworthiness of human nature. By entrusting the local church to a group of  leaders, the likelihood that one person will go bad or be misled and destroy  the church is reduced. Satan's task is made more difficult—he must not only  mislead and tempt an individual, but must win over a whole group of leaders to  his ends.</p>
<p>We know churches in the New Testament were organized with group elderships  in each city. But we also know that there were often <a href="/teachings/?teaching=1647">multiple home  churches within a given city</a>. How were the eldership teams related to the  house churches in that city? Of this, we know very little. Therefore, we  conclude we are free to improvise in this area, as long as our structures  result in the outworking of <a href="/classes/um2-1.htm">key  principles</a> of church life. </p>
<p>In addition to eldership, New Testament churches had deacons, which means  ministers, or servants. Nobody knows exactly what these ministers did, but  judging from their qualifications, they were trusted servants of the church at  a high level. While churches debate whether elders could include females, we  think it is very clear that deacons could be <a href="/classes/um1-4.htm">male or female</a>.</p>
<p>In Xenos, we have a board of 10 elders overseeing the network of house  churches, but our home churches are led by deacons. We don't believe the Bible  calls for plurality of deacons when they lead groups, but we often prefer plurality,  not only for elders but for deacons, especially if they are going to lead  sizable groups. Here are a number of practical and theological considerations  regarding plural leadership:</p>
<ul>
  <li>With smaller group plants,       forming a team would be a waste of manpower. We can't raise up enough       leaders to form teams for even smaller group plants.</li>
  <li>A plurality of untrained,       ignorant, and immature leaders is no more reliable than a single leader.       Only if the leaders on a team are all trained and relatively mature Christian       workers can we assume that a group will be more reliable than an       individual.</li>
  <li>We used to view our leaders       as coequal within a team. Now we prefer to have a senior leader. Having a       senior leader allows some insignificant decisions to be made without a meeting,       which is easier for everyone. Also, recognizing a senior leader authorizes       that person to take initiative in leading the leadership team. This       counters the paralysis that may result from &quot;leadership by       committee.&quot; However, a majority of the team can overrule a senior       leader, so accountability is preserved.</li>
  <li>Medium sized groups, like       home churches, are large enough to have an identity as a group or a       community, and may develop loyalty to their own home church, more than to       the larger church. On the positive side, this makes home churches very       hardy—nearly indestructible. On the other hand, many churches are       reluctant to establish medium sized groups because of their history of       divisiveness. We think plurality of leadership is one answer to this       negative tendency found in some medium-sized groups. While plural       leadership may decide to divide from the rest of the church, it seems much       less likely that an entire well-trained team would decide to take this       unrighteous direction. During over 30 years of ministry, Xenos has       experienced very little divisiveness from home churches. On the other       hand, sometimes churches' efforts to prevent division cause more harm than       division itself. We would rather have one of two home churches leave if       they want to than have all our groups suffer based on the fear of       division.</li>
  <li>Planting groups with       plurality of leadership is slower than planting with single leaders.       Another potential negative for leadership teams is conflict within the       team. Corporate leadership requires a willingness to accept limitations on       autonomy and decision making that the immature find irksome if not       unacceptable. Leaders must develop skills of negotiation and patient       communication in order to form a successful team. Certain self-willed and domineering       individuals are weeded out by their inability to function as team players,       and this is all to the good.</li>
  <li>In Xenos, home church leaders       are not empowered to remove other home church leaders from leadership.       Only the elders can remove a home church leader. This prevents a majority       from overrunning a minority in a team without outside confirmation.</li>
  <li>Since so many pastoral issues       involve sensitive judgment calls, elders may find themselves wondering       whether to trust the judgment of single leaders at times. But when a team       of trained leaders concur in a judgment call, we have a good basis for       trusting their view.</li>
  <li>Not only the elders' minds       are eased by plurality; home church leaders find their own minds eased by       the opportunity to bounce ministry questions off other leaders who are       actually involved in the same community. A lot of potential leaders who       would not feel comfortable taking on leadership by themselves are more       willing to consider being part of a leadership team.</li>
  </ul>

<h3><strong><a name="discipleship" id="discipleship"></a>Over 70 percent of attendees involved in discipleship  pairings</strong></h3>
<p>Xenos is an indigenous church planting ministry. Our approach to ministry  assumes qualified leaders constantly are rising up in our midst. We have to  generate more than 60 leaders (net) a year just to keep up, and that number  continues to rise. To succeed it&rsquo;s best not to depend on the staff to  accomplish leadership development. Instead, every mature Christian in the  church sees it as his or her job to help raise up new leaders. This philosophy  of discipleship ministry is explained in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Organic-Discipleship-Mentoring-Spiritual-Leadership/dp/0983668108">Organic Disciplemaking</a>.</p>
<p>Today, around 2000 adults and students at Xenos have someone they are  discipling in private meetings (and many have several). This is in addition to  our home churches, cell groups and classes. We find that these one-on-one, or  three-way times are good for building friendships, and addressing many issues  of application and personal character development. Also, nothing is better than  these small meetings for coaching in ministry development. </p>
<p>We are careful to avoid any definition of discipleship that implies the  discipler has control or authority over the disciple, like in the so-called  &quot;Shepherding Movement.&quot; We teach our people that <a href="/classes/leadership/leadershipandauth.html">discipling  is a facilitating and helping role, not a controlling role</a>. </p>
<h3><strong><a name="xenosyouth" id="xenosyouth"></a><a name="unscripted" id="unscripted"></a><a name="studentteachers" id="studentteachers"></a>Students  do expository Scripture teachings to large and small meetings</strong></h3>
<p>Our visits to other churches reveal students are called on to speak at their  student meetings, but nearly always to give a personal testimony, tell a story  or discuss a topic. So far, we have never seen a student speaker in another  church give an expository Bible teaching. Adults, yes, but never students.  Actually, most youth groups don't have expository teaching even from adults.</p>
<p>We find this curious, especially in churches that believe in frequent  expository teaching. Why not teach students how to interpret and present a  passage of Scripture to their peers? Some churches believe such an approach  would be too boring. But we don't find it's boring unless students have had  inadequate training. Nothing is more exciting than a well-exposited passage of  Scripture! Students study <a href="/classes/hermeneutics/index.htm">hermeneutics</a>, <a href="/classes/homiletics/index.htm">homiletics</a> and <a href="/classes/discussion/index.htm">discussion-leading</a> in class. They also usually go over and even give the teaching to a mentor who  can correct any shortcomings. We think our approach has some benefits. For  instance, students learn their Bible better when they teach it, and they gain  experience teaching and preaching. Later, when they take over their own groups,  they will already have significant experience speaking in front of groups.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Return to the List</a></p>
<h3><strong><a name="missionssupport" id="missionssupport"></a>Home support teams for missions</strong></h3>
<p>Each Xenos mission team also has a home support team. We organize the home  support team as a <a href="/admin/minteam.htm">ministry  team</a> like any other. The leader has to be a Servant Team member. Other  participants usually include the prayer and support team for all the  missionaries on the team. They regularly meet for prayer and to share news  about the ministry. They also assist the team by helping with their newsletters  or stories in the Xenos News.</p>
<p>Missions expert Tom Telford says Xenos is the only church he knows of that  has such missions teams. He felt it was a good idea, because it served to  entwine missions into the fabric and strategy of the church as a whole. Our  missionaries love it! They have work to focus on where they are, and can still  do a good job raising awareness in Columbus  by giving their information to their support team, and letting them take it  from there. On some occasions, the teams raise money for special projects, or  gather clothes or other wish list items for the field.</p>
<h3><strong><a name="membership" id="membership"></a>No formal membership</strong></h3>
<p>This certainly is not unique, but it is somewhat unusual, especially for  large churches. Our refusal to establish a formal membership is the result of  our theological <a href="/classes/um1-1a.htm">understanding  of church membership</a>, and our efforts to <a href="/classes/um3-1.htm">emulate the early church</a>. Our  definition of the church is spiritual, (i.e. all true believers are part of the  body of Christ whether they attend meetings or not) and therefore we feel it  would be impossible for humans to accurately know who is a member and who is  not. We believe efforts to establish membership can result in an institutional  definition of the church rather than an organic or spiritual definition. Some  that we define as members would be truly non-members, while others who we deny  are members would in fact be members.</p>
<p>We see this distinctive as a good thing, but at the same time, a minor  thing. We don't feel strongly critical of churches that have formal  memberships, and in fact, it would be difficult to say how much actual impact  this feature has had on Xenos' development. Our leadership feel that refusing  to define membership contributes to a proper view of the spiritual nature of  the church. We tell people that we let God keep our membership rolls for us.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Return to the List</a></p>
<h3><strong><a name="2pastors" id="2pastors"></a>Two senior pastors instead of one</strong></h3>
<p>Xenos has two lead pastors, or elders, Dennis McCallum and Gary DeLashmutt. </p>
<p>We consider this distinctive to be an unimportant and peripheral feature, by  no means mandated in Scripture. In fact, both Dennis and Gary have stated they  would not recommend this arrangement for most churches. The arrangement at  Xenos is based on the <a href="/aboutxenos/history.htm">unique  history</a> of these two men who have worked as partners for 30 years, after  knowing each other since kindergarten! They were not only partners in ministry,  but also co-owned a business for years before Xenos put them on staff. </p>
<p>Their partnership has been mutually beneficial, as they believe their  personalities are complementary. But they believe it would be both difficult  and pointless to try to duplicate such a partnership in most cases, and if one  of them were to die or leave, almost certainly no effort would be made to  replace the lost partner in a coequal role. Usually coequal partnerships become  a deadlock and a liability, but in our case it seems to work out well.</p>
<p>Today, the two men share the same office (like most staffers at Xenos, where  office sharing is encouraged). They meet for breakfast, sharing and occasional  prayer on Tuesday mornings at McDonald's, as they have for 25 years. </p>
<h3><strong><a name="questions" id="questions"></a>Question and Comment time at main meetings</strong></h3>
<p>Visitors are surprised when our main &quot;service&quot; ends and the pastor  asks if there are comments or questions. People hold up their hands and speak,  either with or without cordless microphones, depending on the acoustics of the  venue. People can ask questions, share an experience, or add a point.</p>
<p>This part of our Central Teachings is very popular, especially with new  people. Of course, we have no way of knowing what people will say. Some guests may  use this time to express outrage or disagreement with what was said. When this  happens, the speaker gives a rejoinder and we move on. Once in awhile, someone  may share something inappropriate or really crazy! Our teachers ask them to sit  down and offer some appropriate response.</p>
<p>Usually, the questions or points are quite good. It gives the church an  opportunity to correct imbalances in the teaching, or to clarify points that  were unclear or misleading. We love it!</p>
<p><a href="#top">Return to the List</a></p>
<h3><strong><a name="name" id="name"></a>Strange name</strong></h3>
<p>People are always asking about the name Xenos Christian Fellowship. Some of  our members regret this name, because it can cause suspicion, like anything  that is unusual. The name actually makes sense. Xenos is the Greek word for  alien or sojourner, and the Bible says Christians are sojourners in this life;  our citizenship is in heaven (Phil. 3:20).  Also, the word means host, which we feel we are to non-Christian guests. But  the reason we have the name goes back to the time of our incorporation as a  church in 1982.</p>
<p>By 1982, we had already existed for 12 years under the even stranger name,  &quot;Fish House Fellowship.&quot; We never chose the name, but people created  it as a description of &quot;the fellowship meeting at the Fish House.&quot;  Fish House was the original house on The Ohio State University campus we used  as a headquarters. By the 1980s, the house had long since ceased to exist, so  calling our church by that name was absurd.</p>
<p>When we incorporated, the elders left the choice to our home church leaders.  They voted for Xenos Christian Fellowship over several more conventional  options.<br />
</p>
<h3><strong><a name="confidentiality" id="confidentiality"></a>View of Confidentiality</strong></h3>
<p>Xenos leaders take exception to the modern American view that counseling  should necessarily be done in confidentiality, especially if confidentiality  means counselors and pastors are not allowed to confer with other pastors and  counselors. We find the <a href="/classes/servanthood2/counstools.htm#confidentiality">notion  of unqualified confidentiality may conflict with the biblical notion of  corporate leadership and church discipline</a>. </p>
<p>How can leaders pastor collectively, if they are not free to share what they  know from conversations with members? We feel the idea of collective or  corporate leadership becomes a dead letter any time members can forbid leaders  to discuss cases with each other.</p>
<p>Likewise, today's view of confidentiality flatly contradicts Jesus' call to  &quot;tell it to the church&quot; when someone refuses to repent for sin.  Sinful acts are usually those which clients are most eager to keep in  confidence.</p>
<p>As a result of these findings, clients seeking pastoral counseling from  Xenos staff counselors must sign a waiver of confidentiality. The waiver makes  clear that information will only be shared with pastoral staff except in cases  of formal church discipline. If a client feels the need to counsel in complete  confidence, we refer them to professional counselors outside the church.</p>
<p>The same goes for informal counseling with Xenos leaders. We are on public  record as rejecting the validity of unqualified confidentiality across the  board, because as secrecy increases, community decreases.</p>

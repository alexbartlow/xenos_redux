      <h1>What Are the Roles of <br />
        Leaders in Xenos?</h1>
      <p>We have a big 
        emphasis in Xenos on home groups and the qualifications and requirements 
        for home group leadership within Xenos. We think it&#146;s the way people 
        get connected in a large church, similar to what we read about in the 
      early New Testament churches described in the book of Acts.</p>
      <p>We&#146;ll look at some of the roles of our home group leaders. This 
        article is abstracted from <a href="../strange.htm">information</a> 
        published by Lead Pastor Dennis McCallum.</p>
      <h3>home group leaders handle all weddings, visitations and funerals</h3>
      <p>In most churches, the staff handles functions such as these. In order 
        to marry members, home church leaders have to be ordained by the church. 
        This is something most churches are reluctant to do, since they don&#146;t 
        want to proliferate ordained pastors who may not be well qualified. This, 
        of course, leads to the conclusion mentioned earlier: that we must hold 
        higher qualifications for our home church leaders.</p>
      <table align="right" width="220">
        <tr> 
          <td width="150" height="2"> 
            <h2>our approach to ministry assumes qualified leaders constantly 
              are rising up in our midst</h2>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>At Xenos, we not only allow home church leaders to carry out these functions 
        with their members, we require it. If a couple approached one of our lead 
        pastors and asked to be married, we would point out that they need to 
        ask their home church leaders to marry them. In a church where scores 
        of marriages may occur every year, our top leaders would be unable to 
        do much besides marry people every weekend if not for this policy. </p>
      <p>Visiting the sick would require even more hours for the pastoral staff. 
        But at Xenos, sick people are visited and counseled by people in their 
        home groups. </p>
      <p>When visiting pastors ask how we find time to disciple new leaders, write, 
        study, travel and teach classes, we point out that half the hours normal 
        
        pastors would spend in basic pastoral functions are covered by our home 
        group leaders. This enables leaders to focus more time on discipling and 
        equipping. Our elders consider this oddity one really important feature 
        of Xenos, opening the door to lay ministry in a number of ways.</p>
      <h3>home group leaders prepare their own Bible teachings</h3>
      <p>Most churches we have studied provide a curriculum or lesson plan for 
        their home groups. These may be based on the sermon that week, or may 
        be nationally published small group curriculum like Serendipity or Touch. 
        We have looked at these options and experimented with some, but in the 
        end prefer not to use any.</p>
      <p>Our leaders are equipped to develop their own lessons, mainly based on 
        expository study of the Bible. By far the majority of our groups are engaged 
        in expository Bible study of a New or Old Testament book at any one time. 
        In addition, groups occasionally do topical series on subjects of interest, 
        like marriage, finance, social ethics or theological topics. Our Study 
        Center provides all the materials leaders need to do personal research, 
        and groups also leave copies of series they have developed at the Center 
        for other groups to use. </p>
      <table align="right" width="200">
        <tr> 
          <td width="150" height="2"> 
            <h2>our leaders are equipped to develop their own lessons, mainly 
              based on expository Bible study </h2>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>In recent years, our leaders have also benefited greatly from our extensive 
        Web site. We find that leaders who base their groups on prepared curriculum 
        lose interest in teaching. The curriculum is often oversimplified and 
        seems to do too much for the teacher. Teaching people the ways of God 
        becomes something anyone can do and loses its challenge. People who are 
        doing sophisticated work in their careers may come to lead their Bible 
        study group and find themselves doing childishly simple work. No wonder 
        they lose interest!</p>
      <h3>home group leaders get others involved in discipleship</h3>
      <p>Xenos is an underground indigenous church planting movement. Our approach 
        to ministry assumes qualified leaders constantly are rising up in our 
        midst. We have to &quot;raise up&quot; more leaders every year just to keep up. When you consider how high our standards 
        are for leadership, you realize this isn&#146;t an easy task. </p>
      <p>But we continue to succeed because we don&#146;t depend on the staff 
        to accomplish our leadership development. Instead, every mature Christian 
        in the church sees it as his or her job to help raise up new leaders. 
        Today, nearly 1,000 adults and students at Xenos have someone they are 
        discipling in private meetings (and many have several). This is in addition 
        to our home churches, cell groups and classes. </p>
      <p>We find that these one-on-one times are good for building friendships, 
        and that many issues of application and personal character development 
        can only come out in these meetings. Also, nothing is better than a one-on-one 
        meeting for coaching in ministry development. </p>
      <p>We are careful to avoid any definition of discipleship that implies the 
        discipler has control over the disciple, like in the so-called &#147;Shepherding 
        Movement.&#148; We teach our people that discipling is a facilitating 
        and helping role, not a controlling role. We are optimistic today that 
        leaders will be ready when needed tomorrow, because so many of 
        our people are actively engaged in personal discipleship.</p>

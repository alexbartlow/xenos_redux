      <h1>What Importance Does Xenos Give to the Act or Ordinance of Communion?</h1>
      <p>We find only two remaining ordinances in New Testament Christianity &#151;water 
        baptism and the Lord's Supper (i.e. communion). These ordinances are very 
        simple in comparison to the elaborate ritual of the Old Testament. </p>
      <p>Baptism is only practiced once in a person's life, and the New Testament 
        gives no instruction on how often to celebrate communion. (It only says 
        &quot;as often as you do it&#133;&quot;) This is a striking contrast to 
        the Old Testament forms spelled out in exacting detail. </p>
      <p>In Xenos, baptism and the Lord's Supper are practiced in the more intimate 
        setting of our home groups with other Christians. We also take the Lord's 
        Supper at large meetings attended only by Christians in Xenos, such as 
        Servant Team retreats for our lay leadership. </p>
      <p>Apart from the logistics and time it would take, we do not include communion 
        as part of our Central Teachings (CT) primarily because these meetings 
        are also designed for people who have not yet begun a personal relationship 
        with Jesus Christ. We do not want to confuse or make them feel excluded 
        while they investigate the claims of the Bible and the offer of forgiveness 
        from Christ.</p>
      <h3>What is Communion?</h3>
      <p>In Paul's letter of 1 Corinthians (chapters 11-13), he addresses problems 
        the Corinthian churches were having in their house meetings. Paul not 
        only rebukes them for their wrong attitude; he also explains the right 
        way to meet together, and he begins this description by explaining the 
        Lord's Supper in 11:23-26. </p>
      <p>So much misunderstanding and superstition surrounds this ritual. It is 
        actually a very beautiful way for Christians to come together, but we 
        must understand its meaning and purpose before we can benefit from it. 
      </p>
      <p>Having been directly instructed by the risen Lord on this matter (vs 
        23a), Paul explains it to them and us:</p>
      <p>For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that 
        the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread; and when 
        He had given thanks, He broke it, and said, &quot;This is My body, which 
        is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.&quot; In the same way He took 
        the cup also, after supper, saying, &quot;This cup is the new covenant 
        in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.&quot; 
        For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the 
        Lord's death until He comes. </p>
      <p>The Lord's Supper is not a magical reenactment of Christ's death by which 
        God's acceptance is doled out to us. This view of ritual is totally foreign 
        to the Bible. Rather, the Lord's Supper is a symbol of Christ's gift to 
        us. </p>
      <p>The first Lord's Supper was a Passover meal, highly symbolic of God's 
        provision of a blameless substitute to exempt us from God's judgment for 
        sin (Exodus 12). This ritual meal was a foreshadowing of Christ's death. 
        When Jesus took it with his disciples, he was announcing that he was about 
        to fulfill what the first Passover foreshadowed, which is why we don't 
        sacrifice animals anymore. Instead, Jesus focuses our attention on new 
        symbolic elements, namely the bread and the wine.</p>
      <h3>Why bread and wine?</h3>
      <p>The <i>bread</i> is not magically turned into Christ's body. When Jesus 
        said, &quot;This is my body,&quot; his disciples knew where his physical 
        body was. They knew he was speaking figuratively, as he often did (e.g. 
        &quot;I am the door&quot;; &quot;I am the vine&quot;). </p>
      <p>The bread <i>represents</i> his body, his person containing God's spiritual 
        life that is now available to us (John. 6:35). Through union with Christ, 
        we have access to the spiritual life of God. The hunger in our hearts 
        for love, meaning, security and significance can be fundamentally satisfied 
        by knowing Christ, instead of restlessly seeking to fill that emptiness 
        with poor substitutes (John. 6:27).</p>
      <p>The <i>wine</i> is not magically turned into Christ's blood. It signifies 
        &quot;the new covenant in (at the cost of) my blood.&quot; That is, the 
        wine represents the death of Jesus, which makes this new life available 
        to us. God's life is available to us only because he forgives us of our 
        sins. This forgiveness is available solely through Jesus' voluntary and 
        substitutionary death.</p>
      <h3>Why take communion?</h3>
      <p>Paul explains three purposes for taking the Lord's Supper: </p>
      <p><b>First, it is a remembrance</b> (vs 24,25). It is one way to remind 
        ourselves of this precious, awesome gift from a gracious God. What a tragic 
        irony that a ritual, which beautifully emphasizes God's gift to us has 
        been perverted into a work that we do to earn God's favor! We need to 
        be reminded because we so easily drift into a spoiled, thankless attitude 
        toward God.</p>
      <p><b>Second, it is a proclamation</b> (vs 26). Taking the Lord's Supper 
        is one way of communicating to God and others that you have personally 
        received Christ's gift, and that you have personally trusted in his death 
        to forgive your sins and unite you with God. This is why it is inappropriate 
        to observe communion unless you've received Christ. </p>
      <p><b>Third, it is also an expression of our unity with each other</b> (1 
        Corinthians 10:16,17). Just as we are united to Christ, we are also united 
        to one another. Thus, communion is a &quot;sharing&quot; (Gr. koinonia)&#151;a 
        way of expressing our spiritual unity in Christ as our high priest (Hebrews 
        4:14-15).</p>
      <p>That's why we observe it in a personal way with Christian friends who 
        know and love one another&#151;not in a formal, ceremonial way with a 
        minister or priest acting as our mediator.</p>

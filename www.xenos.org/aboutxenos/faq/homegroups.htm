      <h1>Why Are Home Groups So Important and What Are They Like?</h1>
      <p>The following article is abstracted from <a href="../strange.htm">information</a> 
      published by Lead Pastor Dennis McCallum.</p>
      <p>Xenos is a movement of about 200 house churches, which are grassroots 
        groups that meet in someone&#146;s home. Most cell-based churches in America 
        today have a two-level structure. The large meetings are the corporate 
        worship meetings, and the small meetings are the cell groups. <br />
        Cell groups, or small groups are usually six to 15 adults. Some churches 
        have their small groups limited to believers only. Others welcome new 
        people. But we have talked to a number of leaders who find themselves 
        torn with this arrangement. </p>
      <p>Some pastors worry their believer-only small groups will turn inward 
        and lose interest in outreach. The small groups could become Bible clubs 
        for Christians, or &#147;holy huddles.&#148; Others worry that because 
        their small groups are always geared toward new people, there are no meetings 
        in the life of their church devoted to discipleship and deep learning. 
        Churches have trouble raising up good leaders when no meetings offer deep 
        learning and accountability.</p>
      <h3>Three-Level Structure</h3>
      <p>At Xenos, we have a three-level structure. We have our big meetings (Central 
        Teachings or &#145;CTs&#146;) like other churches, although they are not 
        worship services. We also have home churches, which are groups of 12 up to 
        60 adults. Home churches are open to non-Christian guests, and are really 
        small communities. </p>
      <p>Within each home church there are typically two or more cell groups. 
        Our cell groups are usually four to 10 men or women, but not both. The 
        men&#146;s or women&#146;s cell groups are typically for Christian believers 
        only, and usually have a fairly aggressive study schedule. They usually 
        share and pray for each other as well. These are groups devoted to discipleship 
      (mentoring) and spiritual growth. </p>
      <p>        Thus, with our three-level structure, we have home group meetings devoted 
          to sharing about God with people investigating Christianity, as well as 
          some devoted to spiritual growth. For many groups, this means a third 
          meeting each week or every other week. Other groups alternate the home 
        church and the cell group meetings. </p>
      <p>We find that our three-level structure addresses all the needs in the 
        church in a way no two-level structure is likely to do. We have experimented 
        with two-level approaches on several occasions, but the groups always 
        seem to go back to three-level arrangements after a time.</p>
      <h3>Leadership Guidelines</h3>
      <p>All staff and elders are required to be in a home group. This is certainly 
        not unique, but in our experience, it is relatively unusual. Particularly 
        important to us is that our top leadership is fully involved and actually 
        leading regular home churches. </p>
      <p>When consulting with churches interested in building their home group 
        networks, we often find the senior pastor and others aren&#146;t in a 
        home group for a variety of reasons, and have no intention of joining 
        one. We find it unlikely that such churches will succeed in building high-caliber 
        home-based community. For one thing, if the top leadership isn&#146;t 
        on board with the home fellowship agenda, how likely is it that the church 
        will see this as a central issue?</p>
      <p>People also will quickly draw the conclusion that community of this kind 
        must not be essential for spiritual health, because what&#146;s good for 
        the goose is apparently not good for the gander. </p>
      <p>We think it is important those on staff for pastoral counseling be leaders 
        of home groups. This is because we have noticed a tendency in people involved 
        in healing ministries to discount the importance of mission and leadership 
        unless they are themselves vitally involved as leaders.</p>
      <p>Finally, top leaders who aren&#146;t involved weekly in personal discipleship 
        and motivating a home group will not be drawing their illustrations and 
        lessons from that experience set. We want our leaders to regularly relate 
        what they are learning in their groups when teaching and speaking.</p>
      <h3>Leaders&#146; Lives Matter</h3>
      <p>We also believe the realities of group leadership and personal discipleship 
        often bring to light the truth about Christian leaders&#146; lives. We 
        have seen repeatedly that when a Christian leader begins to develop a 
        personal spiritual problem, it comes to light first in that person&#146;s 
        home group.</p>
      <p>Likewise, leaders who are drifting into negative territory spiritually 
        are usually the first to begin to downplay the importance of home fellowship 
        ministry, discipleship and personal evangelism. Large-group preaching 
        can be ego-enhancing, but personal discipleship is quiet and obscure background 
        work. That&#146;s another reason we consider effective discipleship to 
        be a prerequisite to public ministry. </p>
      <p>Finally, we want our paid staff to live the same struggle the rest of 
        our leaders do: balancing career, family and volunteer ministry.</p>

<h1>Xenos Christian Fellowship<br>
1994 Annual Report</h1>

<hr>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>By God's grace, Xenos recovered this year from significant setbacks sustained during
1993. After experiencing a large-scale division, including the departure of well over a
thousand people, we might have expected huge cutbacks in budget, programs and ministry.
Instead, we have seen actual advances in giving and very little loss of programs or
ministry. </p>

<p>1994 was the first year Xenos experienced the benefits of a voluntary pledge program
and the Fiscal Support Team. The results have been impressive. Though overall attendance
was down by almost one third from 1993, our giving was stronger than ever! In fact, giving
in 1994 was almost $30,000 above budget. Also, while our giving increased, our spending
was actually down from the previous year, so we ended the year with a sizable surplus
which will help us to build our new facility. God has granted additional large-scale
growth in Community Development, growth in course offerings and attendance, reduced
deficits at Calumet Christian School, significant growth in student outreach and final
pay-off of our building site--all while reaping a steady harvest in the main adult
outreach meetings. </p>

<p>Today, we can feel confident that we stand unified as a church under God's blessing,
and that we are well situated for an aggressive ministry campaign during 1995. At the 1994
Fiscal Support Team retreat last month, the team elected to increase our ministries and
giving budget by 9% during 1995. </p>

<p>Once again, we will present our assessment of each ministry division for the past year,
along with summaries of important goals for 1995. Each division will also report its
budgetary needs and staffing levels. In addition to the expansion described in the
following sections, the Fiscal Support Team voted to raise staff pay levels by an average
of 4% and to raise elders and management team pay levels by an average of 3%. </p>

<hr>

<h3><a href="../../admin/ops.htm">OPERATIONS DIVISION</a></h3>

<hr>

<p><font size="2">The mission of Xenos Christian Fellowship's Operations Division is to
facilitate the ministries conducted by the other Xenos Christian Fellowship divisions.
This mission is accomplished by providing the other divisions with timely, accurate
financial and statistical data, a mechanism ensuring effective inter-divisional
communication, objective periodic evaluation of program effectiveness, human resources
support, clean and comfortable facilities, and professional administrative support.</font>
</p>

<hr>

<h4>SUMMARY OF 1994</h4>

<p>The Operations Division managed 1994 expenditures to ensure a positive cash flow for
the year. We also developed a Ministry Assessment Process, completed our new database
design, and developed a Salary Administration Plan. Additionally, we met all of our
internal reporting deadlines (monthly financial statements, budgets, etc.). As authorized
by the Fiscal Support Team in early 1994, we hired Alan Burkholder as fiscal controller,
which has contributed to substantial improvement in Xenos' accounting. We also hired Andy
Ault, a data professional, as our new data processing manager. During 1994, Andy completed
our new database design. The Operations Division itself finished the year $45,000 or 7%
below budget. </p>

<h4>1995 PRIMARY GOALS</h4>

<p>In addition to meeting ongoing goals such as providing timely monthly financial
statements, we plan to implement several new programs in 1995. The Human Resources
Department will facilitate the evaluation of accredited ministry teams using the new
Ministry Assessment Process. Additionally, we will implement a Salary Administration Plan
and a new Employee Benefit Plans. These plans should result in greater fairness and
enhanced security for our staff. The Data Processing Department will implement our newly
designed, user-friendly database. This new database will reduce work-loads significantly
and greatly enhance the efficiency of our organization. </p>

<h3><a href="../../admin/evang.htm">EVANGELISM DIVISION</a></h3>

<hr>

<p><font size="2">The mission of Xenos Christian Fellowship's Evangelism Division is to
serve God by administrating an effective witness for Christ in Greater Columbus, other
cities in the United States, and to unreached people groups throughout the world. This
mission contributes to the mission of Xenos Christian Fellowship in that it encourages
people to respond to God's love through loving service toward Him and all people by
providing effective structures that will help facilitate Xenos members in their attempts
to help those in Central Ohio establish a personal relationship with Christ, by mobilizing
all Xenos members to carry out their specific roles in the evangelistic task, and by
administrating Xenos extra-local evangelistic projects, including cross cultural mission
work.</font> </p>

<hr>

<h4>SUMMARY OF 1994</h4>

<p>Student outreach moved ahead with approximately 30% growth and dozens of salvations.
The development of student leadership seemed to be a main contributor to this growth.
High-school and junior-high groups contributed most of the growth. As always, a
significant number of college graduates entered the adult meetings. As authorized by the
Fiscal Support Team, we hired Tom Dixon as our part-time Student Outreach Assistant
Director. </p>

<p>Adult Central Teaching attendance grew in 1994, even though we sustained significant
departures in connection with our church division. This means, of course, that many new
people have begun attending these meetings in 1994. It is difficult to determine the
actual number of these new people, but we believe outreach was good, especially during the
last half of the year. Attendance in recent weeks has reached 1600 adults, which
represents a substantial upswing since this spring. &quot;Moms' Play Groups&quot; and
&quot;Conversation &amp; Cuisine&quot; ministry teams grew to include over 30 groups, and
hundreds of guests attended their events. </p>

<p>The World Ministries (missions) Department accredited our Brazilian missionaries for
field work in Southern Brazil and established a Missions Mobilization Team. In a year of
financial uncertainty, the Evangelism Division operated frugally, ending the year 10%
under budgeted spending. </p>

<h4>1995 PRIMARY GOALS</h4>

<p>Again, we will prioritize outreach to students. This year we will clarify our high
school strategy to accommodate the rapid growth on the north end. We will continue to
emphasize student leadership, and develop a tracking program for all students. The
investment in these young people should bear fruit in the future leadership needs of our
church. </p>

<p>In our Adult Special Outreach Department, we hope to mobilize another 10-15 outreach
groups, such as &quot;Moms' Play Groups&quot; and &quot;Conversation &amp; Cuisine.&quot;
We also plan to implement a tracking program that will help improve our follow-up efforts
with guests. </p>

<p>In the World Ministries Department, we hope to form a World Ministries leadership team,
develop a common strategy for foreign teams, and orient all the department's ministry
teams around that strategy. We also hope to place our Brazilian missionaries on the field
by June, 1995. </p>

<h3>PASTORAL DIVISION</h3>

<hr>

<p><font size="2">The mission of Xenos Christian Fellowship's Pastoral Division is to
assist Xenos members in drawing close to God by providing an environment suitable for long
term growth and service to them and their families. This mission is accomplished by
providing home fellowship groups, various ministries which strengthen family life,
Christian education for children, and pastoral counseling and support to members in times
of need.</font> </p>

<hr>

<h4>SUMMARY OF 1994</h4>

<p>The Home Fellowship Department facilitated increases in home group attendance--from 685
in 1993 to 835 in 1994. (Home groups do not include grounding groups or ministry teams.)
But overall home group involvement is down significantly from previous years.
Unfortunately, a substantial number of people who completed grounding groups have not yet
joined a new home group. This situation stands as a challenge for 1995. On the bright
side, many new members joined home groups in 1994. We planted one new small group in 1994
from an existing small group, and grew overall last year by seven groups. In order to meet
this growth, we increased our supervision of home groups and added Doug Patch to our
staff. We also experimented with the &quot;Meta-church&quot; supervision model and will
evaluate it soon. This model assigns experienced volunteers to help in the oversight of
home groups. &quot;Home Group Enhancement Night&quot; is a new meeting for leaders and
assistants, offering leaders encouragement, training, and new ideas. It has been a big
success. </p>

<p>In the Family Ministry Department, OASIS continued to offer the quality ministry
typical of recent years. We also introduced our own elementary children's curriculum and
launched a Vacation Bible School program during 1994. </p>

<p>The Counseling Department ministered to about 500 lives this year through a counseling
class, counseling-oriented ministry teams, and actual counseling. We changed the focus of
our individual counseling to short term, issue-directed counseling. Surveys show that
counselees view this new approach as helpful. Katey Downs, the Counseling Department
director, provides supervision to 6 ministry teams that offer help in many areas,
including marriage communication, pre-marriage instruction, pregnancy loss, post abortion
issues, and substance abuse. Kevin Furno was also added to the counseling team. Finally,
we completed the formation of a Grievance and Mediation team. </p>

<p>At Calumet Christian School, we hired Dave Glover as our principal early in 1994. He
continued the work of streamlining the school by reducing costs and administrative staff
(begun earlier by interim principal Cindy Grover). As a result of their work, Xenos
enjoyed subsidy savings and parents also experienced a reduction in tuition. We repaired
the deteriorating facial wall and sidewalks for far less than anticipated. The
administration stabilized the atmosphere of unrest at the school with an influx of
ministry-oriented speakers and prayer meetings for staff and students. </p>

<p>Overall, the Pastoral Division finished 1994 11% under budgeted spending. The cost of
pastoral ministries fell for the third consecutive year without sacrificing quality
ministry. In 1992, the division spent $339,000. 1994 costs will come in about $100,000
less than that amount. This savings has been realized for the most part by enhanced fiscal
management at Calumet Christian School and OASIS. We also decreased spending by making
changes in the Counseling Department and terminating the Christian Community Meeting. </p>

<h4>1995 PRIMARY GOALS</h4>

<p>This year, the Home Fellowship Department will attempt to enhance home group placement
services for those who are not currently in a home group. We are concerned for the several
hundred Xenos members who are no longer involved in home groups as they once were, and we
want to do everything we can to help them resume this important feature of their Christian
walks. We will call on the home group leaders to help us &quot;roll out the red
carpet&quot; to these folks as well as to new members. We also hope to plant more home
groups this year so that everyone who wants to be in a home group has a place. </p>

<p>Kathy Steinman, our OASIS Director, will go to full time status in 1995. We plan to
increase the number of OASIS classes and reduce crowding by acquiring more space and
recruiting additional classroom volunteers. We will continue to develop our own
curriculum, and we plan to offer another Vacation Bible School. </p>

<p>Calumet Christian School plans to keep the tuition cost to parents at a minimum.
Although a slight increase is planned (typically less than $3 per month), tuition will
still be lower than two years ago for grades 1-8. We have just begun supplementing both
remedial and advanced learning by adding an educational van funded by state money. We
expect that educational scores will remain high or even climb again this year. We plan to
form a new school board in 1995. We also plan to establish a marketing task force early
this year for maximizing enrollment. </p>

<p>In the Counseling Department, Katey Downs will again offer the course &quot;Biblical
Framework for Human Emotions.&quot; She will be developing some new class material on
&quot;Marriage Readiness&quot; and on &quot;Resolving Divorce.&quot; </p>

<h3><a href="../../admin/equip.htm">EQUIPPING DIVISION</a></h3>

<hr>

<p><font size="2">The mission of the Equipping Division is to provide the educational
resources necessary for Xenos members to understand and apply biblical truth. This mission
is accomplished by offering diverse approaches and course offerings for our adult
education program, providing information resources for the church and relevant publics,
developing programs for training leaders and workers, and facilitating the development of
new and existing ministries.</font> </p>

<hr>

<h4>SUMMARY OF 1994</h4>

<p>This year, we completed the majority of grounding groups and began a new emphasis on
the Christian Principles Class. We have enhanced the content level in this course and
assigned some of Xenos' best teachers to communicate this content. Currently, we have 90
students enrolled in three classes. </p>

<p>Academic Resources exceeded it's projected 1,000-person enrollment in adult education
course offerings. Response to the 5-week class structure was positive. This structure
allowed us to offer more courses each quarter. </p>

<p>The Study Center expanded services, including book lending and a monthly &quot;Critical
Concerns&quot; series. Membership remained stable this year. </p>

<p>We formed the &quot;Crossroads Project,&quot; an apologetics ministry, in cooperation
with the City Gate ministry team. This ministry's first project will focus on
postmodernism and current scientific challenges to the Christian world-view. In order to
launch this ministry, we completed a substantial body of research, offered an 8-week
class, and submitted a manuscript on postmodernism for publication. </p>

<p>We exceeded our budgeted expense by 4%. This was due mainly to a substantial shortfall
in anticipated revenue from Ministry NetWorking. </p>

<h4>1995 PRIMARY GOALS</h4>

<p>In the coming year, we intend to build on ministries that took shape in 1994. We will
continue to offer services of general interest to the fellowship at the Study Center.
These services will include both the &quot;Critical Concerns&quot; series, and the
addition of word-processing software, two new computers and a printer. We hope to enroll
1200 in our numerous adult education courses. The &quot;Crossroads Project&quot; will be a
central focus for the division in 1995. We will complete two manuscripts for publication,
and present at least two apologetics conferences. The first conference will be held at
Eastern Michigan University on March 9-11. An additional conference is scheduled for Ohio
State University in early May. The ministry will also begin production of a
documentary-style video series on &quot;Apologetics for the 21st century.&quot; </p>

<h3>SERVICE DIVISION</h3>

<hr>

<p><font size="2">The mission of the Service Division of Xenos Christian Fellowship is to
serve God by providing practical service to the Xenos, non-Christian and broader Christian
communities. It contributes to the mission and vision of Xenos by encouraging its servants
to respond to God's love through loving sacrifice toward him and all people. This mission
is accomplished by creating and administering in-house service ministries, carrying out
Xenos' strategy for community development, and building working relationships with other
organizations, especially churches.</font> </p>

<hr>

<h4>SUMMARY OF 1994</h4>

<p>World Vision also presented their annual &quot;Mustard Seed&quot; award to Xenos
Christian Fellowship as the single most outstanding American church in community
development ministry. Urban Concern was able to exceed their fundraising goal by $74,000.
They obtained and remodeled a laundromat and a house in South Linden for use in the
expanded After School and Bible Study ministries. Jim Swearingen taught a Poverty Seminar
and was chosen for the board of directors for the well-known national organization, the
Christian Community Development Association. </p>

<p>The Internal Service Department conducted successful fellowship-wide and Servant Team
retreats, and assumed supervision of the Servant Team. The External Relations Department
helped provide four projects, including the &quot;Veritas Forum&quot; and the Dan Allender
Conference. The Service Division ended the year under budget in spending by about 10%.
Unfortunately, we were unable to accredit four additional ministry teams we had planned to
accredit in 1994. </p>

<h4>1995 PRIMARY GOALS</h4>

<p>This year, the Community Service Department is planning expansion in several areas.
Urban Concern will be attempting to launch a low-income housing project while remodeling a
twin single in South Linden for use by the Bible Study and After School ministries. They
will also introduce a Job Readiness program for inner-city youth. </p>

<p>The External Relations Department hopes to provide three projects such as Veritas
Forum, while participating in the Crossroads Project (Xenos' apologetics ministry), where
they will provide logistical support. The Internal Service Department will again seek to
provide enjoyable Fellowship and Servant Team retreats while managing the Servant Team for
efficiency and quality. </p>

<h3>SUMMARY &amp; VISION</h3>

<p>Xenos members and leaders have never viewed our group as &quot;a nice place to hang out
and raise a family,&quot; although it certainly is. The point of our existence is beyond
that which is pleasing to us. We exist to serve God and to accomplish a mission he has
entrusted to us. We live in an ocean of lost people desperately in need of Christ and his
love. We cannot save the world or bring to an end the trials even of our own community.
But we can do the part that God has called us to--reaching lost people, serving them with
God's love and raising up disciples who understand why serving God is important. </p>

<p>In a day when virtually every institution in society, including churches, exists to
please their constituency, Xenos stands for a completely different reason. We are not here
to please either our own members or those outside the church, but to equip and facilitate
those who want to serve God according to his calling. Today, Xenos fields a large Servant
Team of highly committed Christian workers; workers who have understood the stakes in
spiritual warfare, who have made the commitment, who have done the work, who have said
&quot;no&quot; to self, who have received the training, and who stand ready to accomplish
ministry to others, even of the most sophisticated sort. This year we look forward to
expanding our Servant Team by adding new qualified members. </p>

<p>During the past several years, Xenos has explored, in a deep way, the concept of the
church as a place of healing. But while we have seen the need to help members find God's
healing, we have consciously turned away from that definition of our church. Whatever
healing or comfort we receive is not the main point. Today, we realize we are here to
accomplish our mission, to give ourselves up in love for the sake of others, just as
Christ gave himself up for us. We are here to come out of our cultural niche to meet the
lost world in their niche. We are here to learn to speak the language of the people in our
field of ministry. We are here to love others for the sake of Christ. As Jesus himself
said, &quot;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but
whoever loses his life for me and for the gospel will save it.&quot; </p>

<p>This year, we will likely break ground on at least part of our facility. We need a
facility to headquarter our ministry and to welcome more people to join us. Our journey to
this goal has been a painful one, full of self-sacrifice. God will use this journey not
only to teach us what self-sacrifice is, but to bring in people from all over the country
to learn apologetics and evangelism. Our &quot;Crossroads Project&quot; and our nationally
published books will open the door for new types of ministry for all of us, just as Urban
Concern and related community service ministries have opened doors for wonderful ministry
during their eight-year tenure. Let's pray that, eight years from now, we are able to look
back at the formation and launching of Crossroads with the same sense of gratification and
thankfulness. </p>

<p>We call on all believers who attend Xenos to join us in our mission. God has brought
you here so you may take one of the oars and begin to pull. No matter what your gifting or
capabilities, God can use you as a vital part of the mission of this important church. </p>

<p>One area where we can all help is in our prayer support for ministries in the church,
including those in which we are not personally involved. Another is by joining in the
financing of these crucial ministries. Unless 70% of our budget goal is pledged by the end
of February, the elders are authorized to cut the budget accordingly. Please consider
making your personal decision today to join the rest of us by making out a pledge for the
coming year. Your pledge says you are truly aboard, you believe in our vision, and you
want to help. Your pledge is not a promise written in blood, but a goal and an intention,
undertaken in faith, to do your part as the Lord prospers you. </p>

<p>Thank God for the opportunity to serve him!<br>

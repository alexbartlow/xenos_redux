    </b></font><p>Author Ralph Neighbor distinguishes between two approaches to church life:
    the cell church design, and the program-based design. Neighbors says of program-based
    churches,<dir>
      <dir>
        <dir>
          <p>In all these attempts, a basic flaw in church life is still evident: They&#146;re all
          &quot;large group&quot; structures. In every case, the members still drive to the meeting
          place from their homes. When these churches use small groups, they use them as
          &quot;holding tanks&quot; for members . . . Such groups develop into navel-gazing clusters
          of impotent Christians who &quot;Bible study&quot; themselves to death. (<i>Where Do We Go
          From Here?</i>, pp.&nbsp;38,39)</p>
        </dir>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>But of cell-based churches he observes,<dir>
      <dir>
        <dir>
          <p>It is significant that in Jesus&#146; ministry he operated out of homes, not formal
          buildings (scripture follows). The lifestyle of the first Christians meeting in house
          groups was so powerful that daily conversions took place . . . There were no specialists .
          . . They networked together . . . As the movement developed, equippers of the saints for
          the work of their ministry arose from within the house groups. . . . (<i>Where Do We Go
          From Here?</i>, pp. 43,44)</p>
        </dir>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>The cell-based church sees the emphasis as decentralization, and grass-roots ministry.
    The program-based church sees the system of programs as the key &#150; a smooth-running
    ministry with groups ready to meet every need through an array of specialized ministries.</p>
    <p>Xenos has grown out of a vision for cell-based church design. &gt;From the beginning,
    Xenos has focused on lay-led neighborhood groups meeting in homes as the key to building
    Christian community and reaching the lost with God&#146;s love. As groups disciple their
    own members and produce new leaders, a process of multiplication may lead to explosive
    growth. Xenos excels in training lay leaders and in supporting home group ministry with
    central teachings. Our youth ministry, although backed by a program, is also cell-based.</p>
    <p>At times, we have seen limitations to an exclusive dependence on the cell-based model.
    The arrival of hundreds of children in the community has required us to form extensive
    programs such as Xenos Christian Schools and OASIS. Biblical convictions in the area of
    missions, both local and around the world, have led us to build programs like our World
    Missions department and Urban Concern. Today, Xenos depends to a large degree on scores of
    programs that are substantially unrelated to the cell ministry paradigm. As the church has
    grown larger, we have seen a clear trend where programs become increasingly important in
    our overall ministry.</p>
    <p>The growth of programs in our church is potentially helpful and, we believe it should
    be compatible with our earlier vision of cell-based ministry. However, this compatibility
    is not automatic or easy. Neighbor has a sober warning:<dir>
      <dir>
        <dir>
          <p>I return to the disturbing point that has been made before in this book and will be
          repeated again and again. The cell group church lifestyle is too New Testament to be
          blended into a program-based structure. It causes endless conflicts for those who attempt
          it. <br>
          The program-based church competes within its own membership for people to fill the program
          positions. It&#146;s not unusual to find a truly dedicated worker who teaches a Sunday
          school class, serves on the official board, sings in the choir, and works on the finance
          committee as well. This person is assuredly a &quot;pillar of the church.&quot; How do you
          think he or she will react when the suggestion is made that the church is now going to add
          on cell group life? Does this person have time to attend to even one more
          &quot;something&quot; each week? Can the program-based design exist if all such people
          abandon their obligations to become relational, ministering, caring persons? Of course
          not.<br>
          Therefore, the pastor who attempts to insert cell group life into the program-based church
          can rightly expect the leaders of his church will not participate at all, or only
          passively. If the cells get off the ground, it will be done by involving those who now
          &quot;sit and soak.&quot; It&#146;s mighty hard to get clinkers to burn after the fire has
          gone out. (<i>Where Do We Go From Here?</i>, p. 55)</p>
        </dir>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>Fortunately, Xenos has an advantage over such gloomy scenarios, because we actually
    began as a cell-based church. But might not the growth in programs lead to contradictions
    or at least tensions in our church as well?</p>
    <p>We believe Neighbor is speaking in the extreme when he claims these two approaches
    cannot be blended. We think they must be blended if we are to carry out a balanced
    ministry as a large church with a diverse membership. The two approaches may be viewed
    more as a continuum than as neat antitheses. On the other hand, we may agree that the two
    paradigms are not ultimately compatible. A church has to settle on the question of their <i>ruling</i>
    paradigm lest they suffer a form of ministry schizophrenia. Only then can elements of the
    other approach be adopted without diminishing the effectiveness of a church&#146;s chosen
    ethos.</p>
    <p>At Xenos, we have always known what our ruling paradigm is. We are a cell-based church
    today, as we always have been. Even at our adult central teachings, 80% of those attending
    are currently involved in a home group. Most of those also attend a smaller cell group for
    discipleship and <i>koinonia</i>. At student meetings, involvement in home groups
    approaches 100% or even higher! But mere involvement in home group is not proof of a
    cell-based ethos. At Xenos, we go further, believing that the heart of true church life is
    living involvement in Christian community, and universal commitment to ministry within
    real relationships. We could see all our programs disappear tomorrow and the church would
    not only survive, but continue to flourish as our 100 home groups and 240 cell groups
    continued to build each other up in love.</p>
    <p>Even though the heart of our church is cell-ministry, our programs are not unimportant.
    For years we waited in vain for the cell-based model to spontaneously reach into the
    poorer areas of our city. Only when we banded together to form an intentional program to
    reach the poor (Urban Concern) did we finally see meaningful ministry to the poor
    flourish. Similarly, how many foreign missionaries would we have today if we had not
    formed a missions department, funded their staff, and begun recruiting, training, sending,
    and supporting mission teams?</p>
    <p>Our Christian education for children programs are typical of ministry that is
    overlooked or at least poorly accomplished by pure cell-based groups. Likewise, we could,
    and have, carried out central teachings without any music or facility. But who would argue
    that these outreach meetings are not enhanced by our support programs? Cell-based churches
    often have no study centers, or formal equipping ministries, and the result is a lower
    level of training and decreased quality of leadership.</p>
    <p>Sometimes exclusively cell-based churches end up focusing only on building themselves
    up. Although the individuals in the groups may be self-sacrificial as they serve each
    other, the church as a whole is self-centered. All the blessing of God flows into the
    church, but nothing flows out. Yet God clearly calls us not just to build up our own
    church. We are also to spread his love to other peoples and we are to care for the poor.
    (Matt. 28:18-20; James 1:27-2:1-7,15,16) To accomplish these aspects of our mission, we
    need programs that enable us to band together as a larger force capable of fielding the
    kind of hitting power such daunting tasks require. This is why the Spirit called on the
    early church to go beyond the proliferation of their home groups and set aside Paul and
    Barnabas to go out and reach other peoples. (Acts. 13:1-5) This was a program launched and
    funded by the local church in Antioch.</p>
    <p>In a word, programs enable a cell-based church like ours to be purposeful about a
    particular direction in ministy, and thereby attained results well in excess of those
    cell-groups alone will ever accomplish. But Neighbor&#146;s warning is valid. We cannot
    allow the growth of programs to crowd out our first mission either in funding or by
    monopolizing people&#146;s attention, effort, or time.</p>
    <p>What then, is the right relationship between programs and cell ministry? And how do we
    preserve the proper relationship?</p>
    <p>In a word, a healthy cell-based church develops programs as it grows, but limits itself
    to programs that enhance and facilitate the heart of the church: the foundational
    cell-based ministry and its God-given mission. Periodically, we have to assess whether our
    programs are over-growing their intended function, or straying from their support role.
    Programs have a tendency to take on a life of their own. Likewise, staff has a tendency to
    perpetuate and expand itself, eventually creating an unnecessary bureaucracy that stifles
    cell-based ministry more than facilitating it.</p>
    <p>This year, the elders, management team, and finally the Fiscal Support Team tackled
    these questions again, assessing a wide range of program options. This report contains a
    summary of our primary decisions for 1999, along with the decisions made by the fiscal
    support team. We believe the new programs and expansion on existing programs will make the
    home-based ministry in the church easier and more effective. But the whole church will
    need ongoing vigilance to avoid sliding down the same hill so many churches before us have
    slid with devastating results.</p>

    </font></b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What a wonderful year this was for Xenos and Missions!
    It&#146;s safe to say that we, as a church, labored with God to advance his desire to
    mobilize an effective cross-cultural witness in the world. Here are just a few of the
    highlights.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the help of several of you, we crafted and implemented a <i>Missions
    Mobilizers</i> program. This program was built to help increase awareness of missions
    activities and to provide meaningful opportunities in which more people can get involved.</p>
    <p>Several noted missions leaders contributed to the awareness-raising effort. Speakers
    who visited Xenos included Josef Tson, Ray Howard, George Verwer, and Graham &amp; Liz
    Cousens. In addition, more than 50 Xenos members went to the regional ACMC conference held
    in Akron, Ohio. Dennis McCallum was the keynote speaker at that conference and Holly
    McCallum presented a workshop on home support team ministries. Over 30 people took the
    all-new missions class offered by Holly this fall. And most of the Missions staff studied
    courses from Columbia International University and attended other important missions
    conferences.</p>
        <p>Several new missionary couples were accredited and began to raise support. 
          Fritz &amp; Marianne prepared to join the team in Eastern Europe. The 
          team of Robb &amp; Holly, Tim &amp; Jennifer, and Sean &amp; Amy prepared 
          to go to Taiwan. And Mark &amp; Steph (accredited in 1997) made final 
          preparations to join the team in Brazil.</p>
    <p>Other initiatives included sending over $23,000 to Southeast Asia to assist the
    team&#146;s relief and development efforts, beginning to research and plan a relief and
    development ministry in the Caribbean, and researching a mission in Cambodia.</p>
    <p>On the home front, the Dayton home group, <i>First Frontier</i>, made arrangements to
    become an independent church, the home group in Zanesville grew, and the International
    Students Ministry made plans to become even more effective.</p>
    <p>Urban Concern reached many for Christ, opened an inner-city school, helped improve the
    academic performance of many children, saw two South Linden youth off to college, nearly
    completed two houses for the Low-Income housing program, helped two families into home
    ownership, all while making important and challenging organizational changes.</p>
    <font FACE="Times" SIZE="2"><b><p>1999 PRIMARY GOALS</p>
    </b></font>
        <p>In 1999 the Missions Division will continue to pursue the goal of &quot;upsetting 
          the world&quot; for Christ. Toward that end, here are some of the goals 
          we'll need to accomplish. For starters, 5 couples will need to be sent 
          to the field (three to Taiwan, one to Eastern Europe, and possibly one 
          to Lebanon). We will need to complete research on the Caribbean and 
          Cambodian missions. Part of that research process will include multiple 
          trips to those sites in order to gain first hand knowledge of needs 
          and ministry options. By the end of the year, we will need to ready 
          teams to send to those fields. And we will need to advance relief and 
          development strategies for existing fields.</p>
        <p>In all, we&#146;ll need to mobilize nine more couples for service in foreign 
          fields. We need to ready two couples to join the team in Southeast Asia 
          and two to join the team in Eastern Europe. To enhance this mobilization 
          effort, Holly McCallum will be promoted to director. She&#146;ll oversee 
          the newly formed Mobilization Department and develop and implement a 
          more formal candidate preparation program. In addition, 50% of Xenos 
          home group members will need to be enlisted as<i> Missions Mobilizers</i>.</p>
    <p>Short-term mission trips heighten awareness about the need for Christ in other corners
    of the world, and they enrich our understanding and vision for what God is doing to reach
    the lost outside of Central Ohio. The Mobilization Department will shoulder the
    responsibility to build a short-term strategy and organize various trips.</p>
    <p>To be effective at upsetting the world for Christ, we will need to keep up our
    home-based support structure. So several key missions staff and leaders will need to
    engage in some additional study this year. They&#146;ll attend some conferences, take some
    classes, and be provided with adequate technical support.</p>
    <p>Local cross-cultural evangelism will need to become more effective. With the generous
    funding supplied by the Fiscal Support Team and other Xenos givers, we should be able to
    provide quite a bit of help. With that help, we hope to see the International Students
    Bible Study attendance increase to 30 people/week. In fact, we&#146;ll need to see <i>Word
    in the Hood</i> (Urban Concern&#146;s adult outreach ministry), the South Linden Bible
    Study, and the Zanesville home group all grow. And with that help, we&#146;ll need to
    advance the increasingly important ministry of <i>Youth for Christ</i> on the West Side of
    Columbus.</p>
    <p>Finally, Urban Concern will need to press ahead with ministry to the needy of South
    Linden. To help them, we plan to expand the Harambee Christian School by one class (adding
    first grade), renovate more low-income homes, prepare more South Linden families for home
    ownership, and send youth on short-term missions trips. And we&#146;ll help them get
    better organized so they can become more effective at their mission--breaking the cycle of
    poverty and raising up Christian leaders in South Linden.</p>

    <p>SUMMARY OF 1998</p>
    </b></font><p>Wow! God did incredible things through you this year. We restructured this
    division at the beginning of 1998 to respond to the growth we began to see in late 1997.
    Part of that includes our new name, but we have the same mission. God has continued to
    grow this church through your work both in size and in quality. Your decisions at last
    year&#146;s Fiscal Support Team retreat powerfully impacted the church, including helping
    people come to a relationship with Jesus Christ &#150; the ultimate purpose of the church.
    Let&#146;s take a look at the year.<ul>
      <li>One of the key 1998 goals was to hire a Central Teaching Program Director. John Rue was
        hired early in the year, and he has accomplished all of the goals set forward and exceeded
        many, particularly in the quality of the ministry. John was instrumental in pulling
        together the tremendous efforts of our Central Teaching task team members (over 300),
        children&#146;s program workers, Mark Grover&#146;s sound and light team, our staff which
        cares for and enhances our facility, talented musicians, and gifted teachers. The result?
        God is bringing an average of over 200 more people per month into our church in 1998.
        Please check out Phil Franck&#146;s report on the Pastoral Division and you will find even
        more exciting news about how these people are experiencing fellowship in home groups.</li>
      <li>The Fiscal Support Team voted in money last year to produce professional videos to
        augment Central Teachings. Horizons Video provided their creative expertise to produce
        five videos, working in cooperation with Chris Lang and Ryan Lowery of our Media &amp;
        Graphics department. This team taped personal testimonies that poignantly demonstrated
        God&#146;s desire and power to change the lives of his followers. We will produce more of
        these videos in 1999!</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>The Fiscal Support Team also voted in an exciting addition to the efforts of our
        division for 1998-- &quot;Evangelism Initiatives&quot; are efforts to help enhance
        Christians&#146; efforts to communicate the message of Christ to their friends and
        families. For example, we provided professionally designed and printed invitations to key
        Central Teaching series, and we promoted the &quot;Sharing Your Faith&quot; classes,
        sports-viewing parties (don&#146;t forget the Super Bowl on Jan. 31<sup>st</sup>!), deck
        grand opening parties, and invitations to new families in our area. Our Central Teaching
        mini-series were among the most highly attended of the year, our &quot;Sharing Your
        Faith&quot; classes were better attended than they had been for several years, and we know
        of many people making new friends at our various parties. Patty Flores has been
        instrumental in putting many of these initiatives into motion. Jackie House has also
        served long hours to make these events a success. Virtually every initiative had a host of
        volunteers insuring a warm but professional result.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These three initiatives, coupled with over a thousand workers who are excited about God
    and take prayer seriously, has resulted in some exhilarating growth. This includes 89
    people mentioning on their Welcome Cards that they had made a decision to ask Christ into
    their lives! Check out this growth at our Central Teachings.</p>
    <b><p><img SRC="../../graphics/arptchart2.gif" WIDTH="363" HEIGHT="233"></p>
    </b><p>Home groups in our division have grown beyond our goals. We had hoped to see the 5
    groups grow to about 145 members by late summer. Instead they grew to about 160 people in
    7 groups. These numbers and the numbers of new people in the Pastoral division&#146;s home
    groups indicate true growth and potential for great spiritual health for our church as a
    whole. <ul>
      <li>Our &quot;community-oriented&quot; ministries also enjoyed a year of growth. <i>Conversation
        &amp; Cuisine</i> celebrated its seventh year of providing home groups with a dinner and
        discussion format that enables neighbors and work mates to get to know each other on a
        deeper level. The <i>PlayGroup Network</i> provides neighborhood play groups for mostly
        pre-school aged children to play together. Simultaneously, stay-at-home parents have an
        opportunity to make friends in their neighborhood and share ideas on becoming better
        parents. You voted in an administrative manager at last year&#146;s Fiscal Support Team
        retreat, and Christine Walker has brought additional creativity and energy to an already
        committed team of leaders. Pam Fallara enters her second year as the Senior Leader with a
        special burden to provide additional resources to families to deepen marriages and enjoy
        family life to its fullest. <i>GameTime </i>is a sports ministry led by Steve Sommers
        which was recently moved from the Pastoral Division. Our church is often described by
        guests as &quot;very active,&quot; and <i>GameTime</i> is one of several reasons for that
        description. Steve organizes softball, basketball, and volleyball leagues spaced
        throughout the year. Xenos home group members enjoy introducing friends and family to our
        church, and this ministry provides a friendly, yet competitive sports environment in which
        guests can &quot;get to know us&quot; a little better. God used these three
        community-oriented ministries to bring many singles and families into contact with our
        church. More importantly, they served as a &quot;springboard&quot; that God has used to
        bring people into a relationship with him. </li>
      <li>The <i>Xenos Summer Institute</i> was a big success this year. Attendance grew by more
        than 200 people over last year (approximately 900 total), and the schedule became more
        compact and convenient. Once again, we had great guest speakers in J. P. Moreland and Bob
        Briner. Our logistics team, staff newcomer Laura Yoerger and veteran Heidi Ann Klingler,
        with key volunteers including Carolyn Voelker and Carla Schoenleb (and <i>many</i> others)
        provided an extraordinary experience for our many guests. In addition to the Summer
        Institute, the department provided support for an excellent series of lectures by Josef
        Tson in November. Activity wasn't limited to Columbus though. Dennis McCallum, Gary
        DeLashmutt, Jim Leffel and Donal O&#146;Mathuna all had opportunities to speak to
        Christians at outside conferences. </li>
      <li>Have you heard great teaching series that you wish you could share with a friend or
        family member who was not there? Have you wished you could &quot;re-live&quot; these
        teachings? This year, External Relations ventured into a brand new area--Central Teachings
        on CD-ROM. We developed 5 mini-series CD's such as <i>Building Closer Friendships</i> and <i>Common
        Objections to Christianity</i>. So far, over 200 CD's have been sold. The department also
        explored new ways of promoting Xenos materials through the purchase of an outside mailing
        list, and the use of mass e-mail. You can also now get our burgeoning web site on CD! You
        can search the site just like you were online &#150; only much faster. We developed new
        tape series and promoted several hundred of our past Central Teaching tapes to the larger
        Christian community for the first time.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>The web site got a face-lift in 1998 with a new, professionally designed &quot;front
        end.&quot; We also added streaming audio and video Bible teachings. Web site traffic
        continues its dramatic growth, with over 15,000 people visiting the site each month. Our
        web site has become a highly successful method of sharing our strengths with other
        churches and Christians throughout the world. We thank God for the fruit he is bearing
        through this new avenue. As you&#146;ll see below, the Fiscal Support Team responded to
        this success and focused more attention on the web by authorizing a full-time Media
        Productions Manager.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>External Relations continued to provide a promotional plan, materials, and the leg work
        behind the recruiting for the <i>Real Life </i>program. This program recruits college
        students who are Christians, but not members of Xenos, to attend Ohio State University or
        Columbus State. Simultaneously, we train them in the key Christian ministries of
        evangelism and discipleship through their involvement in the Campus Bible Study. Jay
        Reilly, Kamie Dixon, Jeff Gabriel, and others have worked industriously to get the word
        out about this program in 1998. To date, over 150 High School students have requested <i>Real
        Life </i>materials. Our first student, the daughter of missionary parents, enrolled in the
        program this past fall. This has been a promising development, with a steady stream of
        inquiries from other missionaries since the fall. We were hoping for more students by this
        time, yet have learned much about the Christian community at large as we have promoted
        this program. Jay and his team visited many schools and programs this Fall, representing
        what God offers through <i>Real Life</i><font FACE="Arial">. </font>They will begin to ask
        interested students to visit us this winter and spring. Please continue to pray that God
        brings us into contact with students who want a solid education and hands-on ministry
        training.</li>
    </ul>
    <font SIZE="2"><b><p>1999 PRIMARY GOALS</p>
    </b></font><p>The growth in 1998 has whetted the appetite for Christian work for many
    people. Our church is not primarily about a few staff doing ministry. God has convinced us
    that the New Testament picture is how his work is done is by <i>all </i>Christians playing
    our roles as he has gifted us. Each of our seven divisions is committed to this biblical
    picture of ministry.</p>
    <p>In the midst of all this activity and growth on so many different fronts, we have to
    ask &quot;How can we best take advantage of this?&quot; As you know, God&#146;s Word tells
    us that communicating the gospel is central to the purpose of the church. Every division
    in this church communicates a message, in text and graphically, to those investigating
    Christianity, not just Community Relations. All seven divisions have materials, events,
    announcements, brochures, videos, web pages, etc. which communicate their mission and
    vision.</p>
    <p>It is time to put our arms around this growing body of material in such a way that
    honors the individual burdens and efforts of those who lead the various ministries, yet
    also provides a consistent message in content and look. To do this, we have formed the new
    department of Communications with John Rue as its director. It is actually a department
    that coalesces existing departments and incorporates a mission that will serve the entire
    church. </p>
    <p>The three elements of the Communications department are:<ul>
      <li>
      <i>Central Teaching Programming</i> - This element ties together the many logistical and
        technical aspects of our adult Central Teachings--the preparations during the week before,
        the logistics of the meeting itself, and the follow-up during the weeks following each
        meeting. The Fiscal Support Team approved the second quarter hiring of a Central Teaching
        program manager to assist John Rue and continue to enhance our guests&#146; experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <i>Media Productions </i>- This is the primary element of Communications through which you
        will see the various projects of the divisions come together (described in more detail
        under the sub-heading <b>1999 Primary Goals</b>). An excellent example of this is our
        Pastoral Division&#146;s project of producing a professional Home Group video. They have
        commissioned the Communications department, specifically the Media Productions element to
        bring this to fruition.<br>
        <br>
        The Fiscal Support Team has approved the hire of a Media Productions manager. This person
        will serve as our web-master while helping to pull together communications projects for
        all of the divisions of the church (brochures, videos, web materials, flyers, audio
        cassettes, etc.). The web-master will ensure that our web-site will communicate a
        consistent message about our church, and will make this message available in print, video,
        and other art forms. She or he will also be instrumental in helping to enhance our
        presence in the Columbus area.<br>
        <br>
        The web-site promises to take a quantum leap forward in 1999 thanks to the addition of
        this Media Production manager. Pages will take on a more consistent, polished look and
        will be updated more frequently. We will add more quality content, and there will be more
        interactive services available as well. <br>
        <br>
        We will also improve our &quot;Xenos Identity Packet.&quot; This is presently an
        attractive folder with brief descriptions of our church&#146;s mission and vision, and
        overviews of our ministry. Yet, we know that a picture really is worth a thousand words,
        particularly when we are trying to describe God&#146;s impact in peoples&#146; lives
        through these ministries. It is disappointing when a guest attends Central Teaching and
        leaves with the impression that this meeting defines Xenos. To help with a concise,
        accurate, yet warm picture of Xenos, the Fiscal Support Team approved the development of a
        multimedia &quot;identity packet&quot; that will incorporate professionally produced audio
        and video shots. We will be able to use this material in video and audio cassettes, as
        well as on our web site. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <i>Master Scheduling</i> - Xenos is too large and diverse to not have a central point for
        scheduling events, projects and facility usage. Michelle Houston will work with John Rue
        to be the point person for this key ministry. This element of Communications will ensure
        that the &quot;right hand knows what the left is doing,&quot; that we are communicating
        that information, and will help us to bring all of the resources of Xenos to bear on the
        event. A good example of this might be Student Ministry&#146;s Parent Orientations this
        spring. The Community Relations division is looking forward to helping these parents get a
        good feel for what type of church we are and what God is doing through us.<br>
        <br>
        In 1998, we did two baptisms at Riverby Park instead of one. We baptized 115 people, 92 at
        the August event. This baptism was too long and quite an administrative strain. We need a
        solution that will allow smaller numbers of people to be baptized (15-20), allow longer
        testimonies, keep the large crowd festive atmosphere, yet accommodate continued growth of
        the church. The Fiscal Support Team voted in a way to implement this solution. We will
        build an attractive landscape pond on site that will serve as a baptism pool as well. It
        will be totally hygienic, safe for adults and children, and available to all of our home
        groups for baptisms. The new deck and large barbecue grill will combine to provide a
        superior baptism event. This will significantly decrease our expenses for baptisms, but
        more importantly it will provide the warm atmosphere these events deserve.<br>
        <br>
        We hope to see more new faces at the 1999 <i>Xenos Summer Institute</i> since the Fiscal
        Support Team voted in a tuition reduction that will make the July 14-17 conference very
        affordable for Xenos Home Group members. Os Guinness and Mark Dever will be the guest
        speakers for this year's institute. Additional conferences are on the docket for 1999. We
        will be hosting a total of 4 conferences, including George Barna, the Christian Medical
        and Dental Society, a large Missions conference and the <i>Xenos Summer Institute</i>.
        Many more people will be exposed to the ministry of Xenos through these events, and the
        church as a whole will be better equipped as a result of these opportunities. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>All in all, it looks like God has planned another exciting year for our church. The
    Community Relations division is looking forward to contributing to his work and making the
    real Christian workers&#146; (that&#146;s you) job a little easier. Stay in prayer.</p>

    </font><font FACE="Times" SIZE="2"><p>SUMMARY OF 1998</p>
    </font></b><p>From September 1997 to September 1998, God gave 9% overall growth in our
    OASIS, junior high, senior high and college ministries. We now have over 1,200 children
    and students attending each week and for that we're thankful to God. We anticipate
    additional growth this year, and we hope to manage it efficiently and spiritually. </p>
    <p>The OASIS program accomplished a major goal, that of managing the program growth in our
    new facility. Because attendance levels are at record highs, we are using many more
    classrooms and overseeing a broader volunteer base. To accommodate this expansion, we
    reorganized our administrative staff. It was a worthwhile process. The reorganization gave
    us improved efficiency to handle the growth. Hats of to Kathy Steinman, our courageous
    director. Also, hats off to the Fiscal Support Team for approving an administrative hire,
    Nancie Baker. She greatly enhanced our efficiency this year. Again, teacher recruitment
    was a top priority&#151;but with God&#146;s help we met the goal. Adding pagers to each
    classroom was a nice technological addition. No longer do we get distracted from Gary or
    Dennis' teachings by the obnoxious parent monitor board. </p>
    <p>We saw growth at Xenos Christian Schools as well. With the addition of grades 3 through
    5 at Xenos Christian Schools and the start up of Harambee Christian School, enrollment
    increased by 81 students, for a combined total of 490 in all three schools--Calumet,
    Xenos, and Harambee. Congratulations to Dave Glover, superintendent, who stayed on course
    and on budget. With the expansion, we added Carole Bucklew as principal to Xenos Christian
    School, and Alex Steinman as principal for Harambee Christian School. Both are welcome and
    needed additions to our great staff. The administration and teachers are also seeing
    excellent results from our new math and language arts curriculum. </p>
    <p>Our Melee program, led by Travis Henderson, is a monthly outreach to fourth and fifth
    grade boys. It has been a tremendous success. Each month we are seeing the majority of our
    Xenos students bringing their unchurched friends. In addition, many of these unchurched
    incoming sixth-graders are being transitioned into our junior high Blow Out.</p>
    <p>At the junior high level, we&#146;re seeing record numbers in our JAM (Sunday morning
    program) and cell group meetings. JAM experienced a growth of 20 students. However, our
    large meeting, the Blow Out, didn't grow at all. We hope to fix that problem by making
    several programming improvements and by improving our personal follow up with the newer
    students. We are, however, grateful to God for the cell group growth. This past year, 3
    new cell groups were planted, and as a whole our cells grew by 34 unchurched students. 22
    of these students reported that they have received Christ! </p>
    <p>Due to the hard work of our Tom Dixon and staff, volunteers, new space, and the grace
    of God, we are seeing over 160 high schoolers pile into our new facility each week. And
    guess what--we are running out of space again! Thanks to the support of the Fiscal Support
    Team members, we hope to build a youth facility within the next 12 to 15 months to
    alleviate the crowded conditions and enable the group to reach more students. This past
    year, the group grew by 33 students, most of them were unchurched! 25 of them said they
    received Christ this year and most of them joined a cell group. The challenge this year
    will be to grow in the midst of crowded conditions. </p>
    <p>Our college outreach experienced solid growth. Home churches grew by 21 students while
    the Campus Central Teaching grew by 36 students. This past year, our director, Dennis
    McCallum, rallied the troops in planting 3 home churches. Two were student plants and one
    was an adult plant. These plants are crucial, as they not only spur on growth but also
    fuel additional leadership. It is also important to mention that not all college home
    churches thrived; some experienced hardship. One thing is for sure, the OSU campus is a
    mission field and a hard one at that. Fruit doesn&#146;t come without struggle and
    perseverance.</p>
    <font FACE="Times" SIZE="2"><b><p>1999 PRIMARY GOALS</p>
    </b></font><p>We want to continue filling up our new facilities! This year we hope to add
    hundreds to our student programs while taking measures to build effectively and deeply.</p>
    <p>At OASIS, we want to successfully manage the program growth by determining the future
    growth of this ministry. A comprehensive look at Xenos' families and how many children are
    coming into our program will be necessary along with a detailed look at a classroom needs
    analysis. This year, we anticipate overcrowding of several morning OASIS classrooms. For
    overflow, we plan on using the Study Center Auditorium for the older grades and possibly
    the Xenos Administrative office conference rooms. To handle the major demands of volunteer
    recruitment, we hope to develop a year round recruiting ministry team. </p>
    <p>At Xenos Christian School, we plan to evaluate the effectiveness of Harambee Christian
    School and determine plans for adding first grade. As with OASIS, we plan on defining more
    closely our long term expansion plans and accommodations for the growing enrollment. </p>
    <p>We are hoping to see the junior high programs grow by 40 students. In order to secure
    this growth, we need improvements in follow-up and meeting programming. The hiring of
    Travis Henderson will help. The leadership also hopes to build solidly by planting between
    six cell groups and adding a net total of 19 new workers. In addition, the OASIS to junior
    high transition should improve with a newly organized &quot;Parent Orientation
    Party.&quot;</p>
    <p>The main goal for the high school work will be to grow in the midst of crowded
    conditions. Yes, the newly approved youth facility will hold 700 students and workers--but
    this provision is a year or more off. Until that time, we need a temporary solution. One
    idea is to hold two semi-separate meetings during the same time and in the same building.
    Here, one half of the group would be held upstairs in the Study Center auditorium for
    their teaching while the other half would remain downstairs in the Youth Room. At the end
    of the night, both groups would join up together. Please pray for us as we try different
    ideas. As in the junior high, the high school leadership hopes to plant several cell
    groups--perhaps even 9. Many cells are overcrowded and unmanageable. We figure an
    additional 21 trained workers will enable us to accomplish the plant goals. What a
    challenge! Finally, several of our motivated students have started after-school outreach
    Bible studies on their high school campuses. The results have been exciting. Some are
    coming to Christ already and many have started attending our Sunday night large meeting.
    Praise God! We hope these student led groups will thrive the rest of the year and next
    fall. </p>
    <p>This year we hope to see a growth of 50 students within our college ranks. To
    accomplish this, we will set a priority on planting new ministry houses (Christian rooming
    houses). We are hoping for six such plants. If that happens, then another major goal of
    planting three more home churches could be accomplished. In addition, the leadership would
    like to assess the quality of the ministry by using the quality assessment tools developed
    by Christian Schwartz. By determining where our weaknesses are, we can more effectively
    lead and grow this ministry. <dir><font SIZE="4"><b>

        <p>Pastoral Division</p>
      </dir>
      </b></font><font SIZE="3"><p>The Xenos Pastoral Division provides Christian community and
      spiritual care to Xenos members, encouraging them toward normative Christian maturity.</p></font>

    <b><font FACE="Times" SIZE="3"><p>Phil Franck, Coordinator</p>
    </font><font FACE="Times" SIZE="2"><p>SUMMARY OF 1998</p>
    </font></b><p>At this time last year, the church was just beginning a year of wonderful
    growth. We were all adapting to accommodate the initial wave of growth the church was
    enjoying after opening the doors to the new facility. One of the challenges for the
    pastoral division--and a blessed challenge--was figuring out &quot;how are we going to
    take this huge influx of new people at Central Teachings, and aid these folks to get
    involved in the main arena for growth in this church, namely home groups?&quot; We were
    well aware that Xenos must maintain a high level of involvement in home groups (80% of
    people at Central Teachings) in order to not go the oft-traveled way of becoming languid,
    disengaged church that has great teachers. Great teaching is of course a huge part of the
    church&#146;s health, but a bigger reason for the spiritual vibrancy of Xenos is the
    relationships, maturity, and ministry that happen as a result of most people being
    involved in home groups. We must never forget that.</p>
    <p>Thanks to funding approval from the Fiscal Support Team last year, we were able to add
    much needed Home Group Connection part-time staffer Rick Armentrout to help so many of
    these eager new people get into home groups. In 1997, Home Group Connection received an
    average of 12 requests for home groups <i>per month</i>; in 1998 it averaged 12 requests <i>per
    week</i>! John Cleary, Rick and the Home Group Connection volunteers did a super job by
    referring almost 400 inquirers from Central Teachings to home groups since this time last
    year.</p>
    <p><img SRC="../../graphics/arptchart1.gif" WIDTH="674" HEIGHT="323">So it&#146;s no surprise
    that, not counting home groups in the evangelism division and student divisions, Pastoral
    Division home groups attendance has risen by around 150 over this time last year. </p>
    <p>Central Teaching growth also accentuates the need to multiply home groups. Home Group
    Director Danny Walker explains how this works: <dir>
      <dir>
        <dir>
          <p>More new people join home groups, and these groups get so big they need to divide. But
          in order to divide, there needs to be enough solid leaders and mature Christians to go off
          and lead new groups. It takes an intentional process of mentoring discipleship to raise up
          these new leaders and workers who will minister to these new groups. It is a thing of
          beauty to see how God takes &quot;average Christians&quot; and unleashes his power through
          their willingness, to help grow his church in this way.</p>
        </dir>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>A lot of sophisticated planning goes into helping groups plant off new groups, so Xenos
    Elder Jeff Gordon joined the home group staff part time to help oversee groups. We&#146;re
    totally blessed to have a man of his caliber. We planted a total of 12 new home groups in
    1997 and 1998.</p>
    <p>The Pastoral Division also administrates the Servant Team. The Servant Team is
    Xenos&#146; deaconate, presently over 500 members, most of whom are home group leaders. To
    be a Servant Team member of this, one must get the necessary biblical training, exhibit
    outstanding character quality as outlined in 1 Timothy 3, and have a lifestyle of
    Christian love and ministry. The elders provide leadership and guidance for this group
    with yearly retreats and monthly meetings which contain some of the very finest material
    on how to do Christian ministry that you&#146;ll find anywhere. The Servant Team grew by
    53 people this year, lost 5. Because of the increasing momentum and verve for personal
    discipleship in Xenos now, we expect to add more members to the Servant Team this coming
    year.</p>
    <p>So much of the Pastoral Division work has to do with home groups, but we are also
    grateful for the excellent pastoral counseling services provided by Katey Downs and her
    staff, Kevin Furno and Bruce Shively. Most counseling is really best done in the home
    group context with friends, but people do encounter struggles for which they need
    additional help. The counseling staff counseled around 200 people this year. Various
    marital and personal shipwrecks were averted this year because the counseling staff
    brought biblical principles to bear on difficult situations.</p>
    <p>The parent-child breakfast Bible studies didn&#146;t happen this year. The volunteer
    organizer pursued other ministry. We may do a few of these in 1999 if there is sufficient
    interest.</p>
    <p>The Wednesday night corporate worship time got a decent start. Jeff and Magumi Bendit
    are leading this music ministry, and the year has seen an average of 60 people per
    meeting. It is now located in the main auditorium mezzanine, from 7:00-7:30 p.m. (before
    classes). Many people have expressed appreciation about the singing and were pleasantly
    surprised at how edifying the time was.</p>
    <font FACE="Times" SIZE="2"><b><p>1999 PRIMARY GOALS</p>
    </b></font><p>We expect another big year of growth in 1999. The two big growth issues are:
    <ul>
      <li>Home groups need to grow by incorporating people from Central Teachings as well as
        through group-generated outreach. Many home groups have room to grow. Others, with some
        adjustments, could make the room to take in new people. Even though we hope to increase
        our Home Group Connection presence at the Central Teachings to further help people get
        into home groups, we need all of you to reach out and warmly meet new people sitting
        around them at Central Teachings. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>With the opening of the new building, we need more new home groups. We hope to plant at
        least 10 more new groups in 1999. It will be crucial to develop Christian workers who are
        willing to trust God to help lead new groups. With the current resurgence of a cell-based
        ministry emphasis over program-based ministry, we expect that many maturing Christians
        will rise to the challenge of helping to lead a home group.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To support these goals, here are just a few important measures we&#146;re taking,
    approved by the Fiscal Support Team:<ul>
      <li>We are taking applications for hiring a part-time Home Group Consultant to help with a
        greater number of groups and the complexity of indigenous church planting.</li>
      <li>We are allotting more funds for individual leaders to receive training, input and
        resources from us. </li>
      <li>We will take more home group leaders to national conferences on home group issues. </li>
      <li>We will provide two excellent Home Group Harvest Bashes per year (in April and in
        October).</li>
      <li>Here&#146;s a really sweet new idea for helping newcomers find their way to home groups:
        a home group video. This 5-minute video will provide a great taste of what home groups are
        all about. We hope to give it away to inquirers. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We expect another strong flow of new Servant Team members this year to build on an
    already strong core in the church. We will also continue to hold events in which people
    from all around the fellowship can mix and meet other people, namely, the cinema review
    nights, and the coffee house nights at the Study Center.</p>
    <p>So it&#146;s been a great year for growth for the main ministries of the pastoral
    division, and all indications are that the Lord will bear more fruit through it in the
    coming year. Please pray for this!</p>

    </font><font FACE="Times" SIZE="2"><p>SUMMARY OF 1998</p>
    </font></b><p>1998 was an outstanding year for Xenos equipping ministries. This is a very
    encouraging basis on which to build in 1999. </p>
    <p>Enrollment in adult education courses has never been greater. Hundreds of people are
    taking classes for the first time. This is one crucial indication that with significant
    growth in the church, we can maintain the level of depth that has always characterized
    Xenos. Nearly 200 people took Christian Principles class, which means that our Servant
    Team should continue to grow. Ministries will also experience growth, as equipped
    Christians enter our work-force. </p>
    <p>This year we trained Jenny Hale and Mike Sullivan to teach Christian Principles. This
    will allow us to cut class size in half, which will improve the depth of feedback and
    attention available to students. We were also able to bring Jen Carle on board as a
    full-time staff person to help augment Mike's time in administering class registration and
    course follow-up.</p>
    <p>In 1998, eight key leaders, including three elders, participated in a rigorous 12-hour
    per week seminar that includes four seminary-level courses in Old and New Testament study.
    This group helped refine the curriculum that will be used in coming years. The seminar
    provides high level training without requiring leaders to leave their ministries for
    seminary or other Bible colleges.</p>
    <p>Crossroads Project contributors remain active, even though we no longer offer our
    &quot;Death of Truth&quot; conferences. We have had the opportunity to send some of our
    contributors to several national conferences and major universities. We also continue to
    publish in magazines, journals and books. The <i>Xenos Summer Institute </i>continues to
    attract inspiring speakers and generates encouraging enthusiasm for our ministry around
    the country.</p>
    <p>We were able to make numerous valuable additions to our Study Center materials this
    year. We now have about twenty seminary courses on audio tape for individual and small
    group study. Several excellent CD-ROM series have been added to our collection, along with
    scores of new reference books and popular literature. Peggy Bartunek headed up a team of
    staff and volunteers that helped renovate the Study Center space to make it more conducive
    to study, and expanded the space available for materials. Our new library management
    system was also finally converted, after several delays.</p>
    <font FACE="Times" SIZE="2"><b><p>1999 PRIMARY GOALS</p>
    </b></font><p>We're confident that 1999 will be another year of growth, as our adults
    commit to becoming even better students of the Word. To support this growth, we will
    identify two additional candidates for teaching Christian Principles. Our goal is to get
    class size down to 30 students by January, 2000. Let's pray for these new teachers.</p>
    <p>We will again offer the leadership seminar in 1999, targeting leaders and teachers of
    the future. For the Xenos Summer Institute, we are pleased that Os Guinness, a noted
    Christian author and speaker, will join us this July.</p>
    <p>In the Study Center, 1999 will see our entire collection go on-line. Patrons will be
    able to order tapes or reserve materials via e-mail and the web. All you'll need to do is
    place an order, and come pick it up.</p>
    <p>In 1999, the equipping ministries of Xenos will continue to cultivate opportunities for
    our fellowship to learn about and be prepared to live a lifestyle of God-focused Christian
    ministry. We will strive to provide the tools necessary to make ministry effective and
    rewarding.<dir>

    Elders</p>
    </font><font FACE="Times" SIZE="2"><p>SUMMARY OF 1998</p>
    </font></b><p>Last year, our division's primary annual goal was simply to <i>facilitate
    ministry within the church</i>. We gauged our success in this endeavor by the feedback we
    received from staff and our members. Based on this criteria, 1998 was a great success. We
    were able to pause from 3 years of facility development projects, and get down to the work
    of providing what is needed for a more productive work and ministry environment.</p>
    <p>Our study center, office and youth building have provided us with an excellent
    headquarters for ministry since November 1996. In August 1997, our Main Campus opened its
    doors. So, 1998 marked our first full year in all of our new facilities. </p>
    <p>In our Facilities Department, Dave Bucklew and John Circle led the charge to make and
    keep our buildings and grounds ready to meet the many needs of the church. We had to
    balance many different requests to use of facilities against the core needs for our
    church. Out of this tension, policies evolved and were documented. Thanks to the many
    facility users who helped us learn what it takes to get control and flexibility into the
    same model of facility usage.</p>
    <p>Our greatest challenge in developing a workable approach to facility use and
    maintenance was the existence of multiple priorities in the meeting spaces and classrooms.
    We serve Xenos Christian School, OASIS, adult education and ministries from within the
    same facilities. We have developed a strong organization for maintaining and cleaning our
    buildings, and for addressing on-going projects for our facilities. </p>
    <p>Without volunteer work, we would not have accomplished all we did in 1998. Volunteers
    have served as unsung heroes augmenting our facilities staff. They have worked weekly to
    clean our office space every Tuesday night. Landscape team members have implemented many
    grounds enhancements. Many other volunteer servants have spent their time improving the
    ability of our facilities to meet ministry needs.</p>
    <p>A short list (not exhaustive, by any means) of the major projects we implemented to
    increase and enhance the use of our buildings and grounds includes:<ul>
      <li>We built the new deck at Main Campus, overseeing volunteer and staff resources to
        provide a 2,100 square foot outdoor ministry space which includes a shelter house.</li>
      <li>We completed a one-mile nature trail that traverses the circumference our beautiful
        property, including extensive drainage systems and two wooden bridges crossing our creeks
        along the way.</li>
      <li>We installed a wooden foot bridge from the south end of the Main Campus building to the
        south lot, which allows for better access to parking in that area. </li>
      <li>We erected a foot-bridge across a main part of Noble Run stream, behind the Office &amp;
        Study Center building. The bridge supports quick access to the Main Campus for
        pedestrians. </li>
      <li>We installed seating around the school playground and by the main entrance. </li>
      <li>Early in the year, we affixed the Xenos signs on the Main Campus building. W just
        completed our new ground-based sign that identifies Xenos as a Christian church.</li>
      <li>We installed a quality sand volleyball pit for use behind the office youth space. </li>
      <li>We made landscaping improvements, including extensive tree and shrub plantings at Main
        Campus and the Office. </li>
      <li>We completed lighting for key trail and bridge areas to ensure a safe environment for
        pedestrians. </li>
      <li>We replaced contracted cleaning services for our Main Campus facilities, improving our
        flexibility and responsiveness to facility uses at a lower overall cost. </li>
      <li>We acquired extensive, cost-effective equipment to allow for efficient maintenance and
        improvement of our grounds, parking areas and facilities. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In our Information Systems Department, we were very fortunate to have Andy Leedy come
    on board as our technical support manager. Working side-by-side with Andy Ault, this great
    duo of &quot;techies&quot; provided the most stable year we have had in our systems area.
    Andy Ault made great strides in the development of our data base system. In addition, we
    implemented an excellent communications infrastructure allowing for web-based and
    wide-area network capacity. The full fruit of this giant step forward in technology will
    be felt for years to come.</p>
    <p>Our Technical Services department (Sound &amp; Light), headed by Mark Grover, also
    oversaw a year of stabilizing and improving our provision of support for the Main Campus
    auditorium, lobby and related areas. Each month we implemented another custom finish for
    our outreach and meeting space. We end the year with a list of requests almost as full as
    when we started 1998, but with less urgency on critical issues. Mark has put together a
    great group of volunteers who serve diligently behind the scenes to support the many
    events and meetings we have besides our Central Teachings.</p>
    <p>&quot;Efficiency&quot; and &quot;effectiveness&quot; were the watchwords of our Office
    Support staff. Cathy Kaiser provided the organizational glue that allowed our office staff
    to work productively without undue hindrances. We are confident that also feel confident
    that visitors and callers receive the direction they need. Michelle Houston and our
    receptionists have also played key roles in establishing a hospitable (&#145;<i>xenos</i>&#146;)
    environment.</p>
        <p>1998 marks the last year that Media &amp; Graphics, and Chris Lang, 
          will work within the Operations Division. Chris will be taking his talents 
          to the Community Relations Division. This past year, this department 
          continued to provide important communication media within the church. 
          We completed the Xenos &quot;Identity Package,&quot; which presents 
          all key aspects of our fellowship in one folder, which can be customized 
          for different uses. We were able to deliver several high-quality brochures 
          for our divisions, as well as some attention getting-flyers for events. 
          We also oversaw the production of five high-impact videos used at our 
          Central Teachings. Two translations of the book <i>Christianity: The 
          Faith that Makes Sense </i>moved ahead, with publishing underway as 
          the year ended.</p>
    <p>Our Finance and Accounting Department continued to provide excellent service in the
    face of growing needs within the church. Our controller, Alan Burkholder, heads a staff
    which provides support to Urban Concern, Xenos Christian Schools and Xenos Christian
    Fellowship--our three corporate entities. With expansion of work in each of these business
    entities in 1998, we expanded support in financial matters with the same staffing levels
    we have maintained for the last 5 years. </p>
    <font FACE="Times" SIZE="2"><b><p>1999 PRIMARY GOALS</p>
    </b></font><p>We are excited to see what God will accomplish through our church in 1999.
    Operations and Administration work behind the scenes to facilitate the other divisions,
    and we experience great joy in helping them meet their aggressive goals for the year. As
    our division achieves excellence in its service to our staff and members, God&#146;s glory
    shines is a greater measure.</p>
    <p>The coming year will see the implementation of our plans for a new Youth Facility. The
    preliminary design project was completed for presentation at the fall Fiscal Support Team
    Retreat; now we will get started. We need to finalize our contractor choice, get through
    Columbus zoning and regulations, and then begin construction. We are praying that this
    mission-critical project will be started by June and completed before year-end.</p>
    <p>We will continue to evolve in our ministry through our Facilities Department. We are a
    unique church in the level of support we must provide to many alternative users of our
    buildings and grounds. The structure we had in place at the start of 1998 was very
    different at year-end, and we anticipate that 1999 holds the same level of change. Dave
    Bucklew and John Circle hold the reins of this area, and we couldn&#146;t ask for more
    capable or God-centered people to lead. </p>
    <p>1999 will see some needed enhancements done to our Main Campus support systems. Mark
    Grover will work closely with John Rue and the Central Teaching function to provide better
    sound and lighting systems. We will also focus on enhancing our lobby space, which
    provides a great deal of information to our visitors and members alike.</p>
    <p>Our office staff and information systems personnel will focus on the development of
    better tools and procedures for providing support to staff and volunteers. We will
    implement a new network architecture in 1999, leveraging off of a newly implemented
    communication structure (&quot;T-1&quot; lines for those who care). We enter 1999 in solid
    shape when it comes to the dreaded &quot;<i>Y2K</i>&quot; problem. Office systems,
    equipment and technology is compliant with the year 2000. Now we&#146;ll see how well the
    power company and other vendors do in providing service to us at year-end!</p>
    <p>Our Finance and Accounting department director and church controller, Alan Burkholder,
    will oversee a major conversion of our accounting systems in 1999. This new system will be
    on a better technology platform, and provide an enhanced basis for management reporting
    and support of all of our corporate locations. Cate Gilbert, one of our incredible staff
    servants, will work with Scot Northrup as he enters into a full-time position in this
    important support department. We will also be looking to the Personal Finance Ministry
    Team, headed by Tim McDaniel, to continue its excellent provision of financial
    consultation to church members.</p>
    <p>In comparison with other churches and non-profit religious organizations, we have a
    unique board of trustees. There isn&#146;t another organization blessed with a group of
    godly men who are willing to commit such a high level of energy and time to support their
    ministry&#146;s work. We will continue to provide administrative to the elders by
    providing oversight of our weekly meetings and follow-up communications within the
    organization. We are excited about John Rue&#146;s addition to our Management Team and his
    oversight of our communications functions, which will capacity in this area. We will
    continue to look for ways in which we can provide the elders with the best structures and
    tools to lead Xenos as we accomplish God&#146;s goals into the coming year.</p>

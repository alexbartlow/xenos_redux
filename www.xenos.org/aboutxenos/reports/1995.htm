1995 Annual Report</p></b></font> 

<hr>

<p>Xenos Fellowship enjoyed a splendid year of blessing in 1995! We should all thank God
from our hearts for answering prayers we have been offering up for years. Our unified and
fruitful church is maturing and reaching lost people in dozens of venues, gaining health
and momentum as we go. Our church has been reorganized this year, with six divisions
instead of five, but since 1995 operated under the old structure, we will report our year
in five divisions one last time. </p>

<hr>

<p><a HREF="../../admin/ops.htm">OPERATIONS DIVISION </a></p>

<table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="1" BORDERCOLOR="#000000" WIDTH="374">
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="MIDDLE">Xenos' Operations Division facilitates and focuses the ministries
    conducted by the other Xenos divisions by providing them with tools, information and

    accurate financial and statistical data, enables effective inter-divisional communication,
    ensures that clean, comfortable and properly equipped facilities are available (including
    programming for new facilities), and provides professional administrative support.</td>

<h4>SUMMARY OF 1995</h4>

<p>In May of 1995, Steve Bauer replaced Tad Hale as the Operations Division coordinator.
In October, Steve took on dual responsibilities by also assuming the position of church
Executive Administrator. These changes to our organization meant the division looked very
different at the end of 1995. Operations departments achieved all major goals for the
year. </p>

<p>Our accounting area managed the funds which were provided in an outstanding year of
stewardship in the church. We managed general fund collections and associated expenditures
in order to provide positive cash flow throughout the year. The church fiscal controller,
Alan Burkholder, and his professional staff, helped management direct resources
effectively through timely internal reporting and analysis. Since we ended 1995 with
$100,000 of &quot;black-ink,&quot; Fiscal Support Team members had the delightful task of
deciding how to spend this overage on additional Christ-centered ministry. </p>

<p>In addition to general fund collections, the division supported a highly successful
building campaign. The success of obtaining pledges, collecting against pledges and
showing overall fiscal responsibility helped us secure financing for our first facility,
and get well underway on its construction at year-end. John Circle has taken on the role
of the church's &quot;point man&quot; in the field as we complete our office building, and
progress in our programming for our new meeting facility. At the same time, John maintains
a role in managing work at our existing rented facilities. </p>

<p>Andy Ault, our systems manager, delivered tools to our staff and volunteers to help us
better perform our work. A new data base system now supports the many needs for
information across the church and its diverse ministries. This system foundation allows us
to have one central source of data, which can be maintained at distributed locations,
eliminating the redundant sources of data about people and ministry we contended with in
the past. This system has already allowed us to improve efficiency of our staff, and
reduce the time it takes to gather and disseminate information critical to the mission of
the church. </p>

<p>Our work to support presentations and music at central teachings, retreats and other
events kept Mark Grover focused on improving our ability to respond and plan ahead. We
made many improvements to our sound, light and stage tools, with all activity subject to
ensuring it could be transferred to the new facilities, when complete. </p>

<p>Cathy Kaiser joined the administration area as church Administrative Assistant, after
completing the majority of her work with the <i>Commitment to the Future: A Time to Build</i>
campaign. Chris Lang's Media Concepts director role also moved over to the Operations
Division during our Fall reorganization. </p>

<h4>1996 PRIMARY GOALS</h4>

<p>1996 will see the continuation of intense activity focused on the completion of our new
facilities. The Operations Division will provide primary support for planning, design and
completion of the buildings. In late spring, we will move our offices and resource center
into the newly-completed office complex. </p>

<p>At the same time, we will continue to meet on-going goals related to facilitating
ministry in each of the other church divisions. Operations needs to help focus human and
financial resources, minimize cumbersome administrative processes and improve the
accessibility of information for our ministries. Primarily, we will continue providing
timely monthly financial statements, administering our enhanced Employee Benefits Plan,
improving our capabilities at existing facilities, providing information and tools for
better management, and improving our communications and publications to serve the church's
needs. </p>

<p>We will also seek better ways to use staff and volunteers focused on five areas: human
resource management, office assistance, systems development and support, facilities and
grounds maintenance (e.g., landscaping), and communications. Ministry Teams will be
analyzed for these key operational areas in the hope that we can more effectively mobilize
the outstanding knowledge within our fellowship to meet the church's goals in these areas.

    Central Ohio establish a personal relationship with Christ, by mobilizing all Xenos
    members to carry out their specific roles in the evangelistic task, and by administrating
    Xenos extra-local evangelistic projects, including cross cultural mission work.</td>

<h4>Summary of 1995</h4>

<p>Student outreach was again one of our major goals, and we met nearly all of the goals
associated with this important ministry. We saw student group attendance increase by
one-third. More importantly, dozens of students received Christ and forty of them joined
study groups. The Junior High Blow-Out meeting increased attendance by one-half, and high
school groups expanded by 45%. The OSU campus group did not end the year with growth;
however, three home churches were formed which have enhanced body-life and discipleship.
We are determined to see a vigorous ministry on campus. </p>

<p>Adult central teaching attendance only grew by 20-30 people this year. We suspect that
crowding in our children's program affected our ability to grow in the adult meetings.
This trend may continue until we move into our facility. Implementing the &quot;Welcome
Receptions&quot; helped incorporate dozens people into home fellowship groups, which was a
major goal for 1995. </p>

<p>&quot;Conversation &amp; Cuisine&quot; and &quot;Mom's Play Groups&quot; grew
substantially in number during 1995. Our goal was to increase the number of these groups
by 50%. The actual number of groups doubled this year! Now, hundreds of Christian workers
are actively using these pre-evangelistic tools to reach their unchurched friends. Over
500 guests attended &quot;Conversation &amp; Cuisine&quot; and &quot;Mom's Play
Groups,&quot; and many have since accepted Christ and become involved in Xenos. Patty
Flores gathered outreach data for &quot;Conversation &amp; Cuisine,&quot; which revealed
that so far over 100 of the 400 guests have also attended at least one Central Teaching
this year. </p>

<p>World Ministries mobilized two missions teams in 1995. Jim and Beth Himsworth 
  and their children left for southern Brazil, where they will be equipping Brazilian 
  workers for a church-planting ministry. The Eastern Europe Team, was fully accredited 
  for church-planting work in Eastern regions of Europe<i><b> </b></i>.<i> </i>World 
  Ministries also began to establish and implement a long-term missions strategy, 
  including fund-raising strategies for Xenos missionaries. </p>

<p>The Evangelism Division operated frugally, ending the year 5% under budgeted spending. </p>

<h4>1996 Primary Goals</h4>

<p>We will again prioritize outreach to students, and include an increased focus on
discipleship. Xenos has formed the new Student Outreach Division to enhance our student
ministries. We hope to see student groups grow by 50% in 1996. This goal is attainable,
but it will require the recruitment of several more adult volunteer workers. We also plan
on implementing a junior high program at the adult central teachings. This should prove
very fruitful in reaching students of adult guests and newer families. The high school
groups will relocate to our new facility this spring, and we will decide whether to
combine our two high school groups or keep them separate. We hope to multiply ministry
houses which will help the transition of high school students to our college groups. We
are also making efforts to rent a more suitable campus central teaching facility. </p>

<p>Dave Merker, the new coordinator of this division, will prepare for an increased influx
guests at our adult central teachings as we begin relocation to our new facilities in
early 1996. We plan on strongly promoting home group involvement, while strategically
enhancing displays that will assist our guests and members. Dave will also initiate more
comprehensive oversight of our Central Teaching task teams. </p>

<p>In our Adult Special Projects Department, we hope to form a ministry team focusing on
outreach to parents of children between the ages of 5 and 10. We also want to offer a few
evangelism workshops, including a fellowship-wide effort. &quot;Conversation &amp;
Cuisine&quot; leaders and facilitators will hold a retreat for planning and motivation for
the coming year. We will continue to pursue forming relationships with our unchurched
friends so they can learn about the love of Christ. </p>

<p>By summer, we hope to have all of our extra-local churches (Cleveland, Dayton and
Cincinnati) formally independent from our Columbus base. Our director will consult with
two experienced extra-local church planters and then write an extra-local church
association policy that will detail strategies for planting new groups and supporting
existing groups. </p>

<p>In our World Ministries Division, we hope to send the Eastern Europe Team to 
  the field by mid-year. We also hope to accredit another team for field work, 
  and personally visit an existing Xenos missions team. Finally, we'd like to 
  develop a training track for future missionaries. </p>

    <td VALIGN="MIDDLE">Xenos' Pastoral Division assists Xenos members toward Christian

  </tr>
</table>

<h4>SUMMARY OF 1995</h4>

<p>The Pastoral Division, led by Phil Franck, made some significant advancements in 1995.
Under Danny Walker's oversight of the home group department, home groups made a net gain
of six groups over last year, adults home group attendance rose from 835 in 1994, to 1128
in 1995. This growth was due in part to the successful reincorporation of over 280 Xenos
people, many of whom had previously belonged to home groups that ended for various
reasons. The new &quot;Welcome Receptions&quot; contributed immensely to helping these
people find home group fellowship. </p>

<p>We called on home group leaders to pursue discipleship relationships with some of their
groups' members, with the goal of raising up new Servant Team members. We also emphasized
other themes of continuing education for leaders and informed them of new ways to enhance
evangelism. We continued home group enhancement nights, which brought additional
encouragement and training to leaders. Experienced Xenos leaders began home group
visitations, which helped the quality of home group oversight. </p>

<p>Calumet Christian School is doing better than ever! Dave Glover did an excellent job
managing the school, SAT scores were their highest in five years. We made significant
plans for capital improvements, as well as numerous organizational and procedural
improvements. We also formed a new school board which relieved the elders of this
responsibility. God answered our prayers for enrollment to reach 300 students total and 40
in middle school. Today we have 304 students and 41 in middle school!! There is good
evidence of spiritual vitality in the students, and some of them are reaching friends for
Christ. We applaud and thank the many CCS (Calumet Christian School) parents who
volunteered on various school projects--they made a measurably positive difference in the
school's ministry. </p>

<p>In OASIS, we were finally able to move into Building 9 this fall. Even though we expect
to reach capacity there soon, the extra space enabled the children's program to grow.
Under Kathy Steinman's able leadership, the teacher recruitment plan was successful, and
we generated our own curriculum. </p>

<p>In the counseling department, Katey Downs offered the &quot;Marriage Readiness&quot;
course and &quot;Resolving Divorce&quot; class. Her &quot;Biblical Framework for Human
Emotions&quot; will be offered in early 1996. The counseling department collections are at
100%, and the department ran smoothly even though the number of weekly clients was at 20%
over expectations. Katey is known for her solid spiritual counsel for people in need.. </p>

<h4>1996 Primary Goals</h4>

<p>In addition to the central emphasis on evangelism, discipleship, teaching and
body-life, home groups will focus on leadership development. We anticipate significant
home group growth after we move into the new facilities. </p>

<p>Calumet Christian school is now in the Student Outreach division. It will focus on
building spiritual maturity into the students. The school's administration will continue
to closely evaluate the state's curriculum as an ongoing commitment to resist postmodern
elements in education. The CCS school board will concentrate on increasing enrollment,
particularly in the middle school grades. The board hopes many parents--in and outside of
Xenos--will learn of our outstanding program and decide to educate their children at CCS. </p>

<p>For the Counseling department, Katey Downs will focus on equipping home group leaders
and workers to provide solid counseling for many of the people in their groups. She wants
to debunk the notion that effective biblical counseling can only be done by professionals
in most cases. </p>

<p>OASIS, which is now in the Student Outreach division, will seek additional writers and
editors to continue developing our own curriculum. OASIS will also focus on getting ready
for the move to new facilities. </p>

</table>

<h4>SUMMARY OF 1995</h4>

<p>1995 has been an exciting year for the Equipping Division. We birthed the Crossroads
Project, our equipping ministry to the broader evangelical church. The Crossroads Project
is a group of Christian scholars, researchers and leaders dedicated to preparing God's
people for effective ministry to contemporary culture. This purpose is accomplished by
applying biblical and critical analysis to current cultural thought and by providing
practical tools to reach the lost and strengthen the church. </p>

<p>We completed important projects, such as <i>The Death of Truth</i>, a multi-authored
book by members of the Crossroads team, that explains postmodernism and its effect on the
culture. We held two &quot;Postmodern Challenge&quot; conferences, at Ohio State and
Eastern Michigan University. The feedback for both the book and the conference has been
extremely positive. </p>

<p>Enrollment in adult education significantly surpassed last year's projections. This is
an indication that our church affirms that learning is essential to spiritual growth and
effective ministry. We offered an average of seven courses each quarter--a broader
curriculum than we have ever had. Most significantly, over 90 students completed the
four-unit Christian Principles class, which is the core curriculum for membership on the
Servant Team. </p>

<p>The Study Center continued to add to its excellent collection and memberships remained
stable. The general response to moving the Study Center has been positive and may provide
an opportunity for significantly increased use next year. </p>

<h4>1996 Primary Goals</h4>

<p>The Crossroads Project will hold at least three &quot;Postmodern Challenge&quot;
conferences in 1996: Kent State University, University of Michigan, and Trinity
Evangelical Divinity School. We will also be promoting <i>The Death of Truth </i>and the
Crossroads Project Summer Apologetics Institute, to be held July 8-19 in our new facility.
</p>

<p>The adult education program will continue to offer a broad and excellent range of
classes. Our goal is to meet the 1995 enrollment level of 1400. We will be exploring some
new options to make our courses more accessible to the church, such as offering a limited
number of weekend and day time classes. </p>

<p>The Study Center will continue to add to its excellent collection of periodicals, books
and tapes. Perhaps most significantly, we will add three powerful new computers, loaded
with software that will connect patrons with the internet and state of the art programs
for biblical and theological research. </p>

<h4>SUMMARY OF 1995</h4>

<p>From various points of view, this was our busiest year yet. As The Crossroads Project
and its conference developed, we logged many hours of fruitful labor. We provided
logistical support at Eastern Michigan and The Ohio State Universities. With the help of
many staff members and volunteers, we began construction of our world-wide web site. </p>

<p>We made some changes in key staff positions in 1995. Jay Reilly resigned as Internal
Service Director, and Tad Hale took his place. Lou Spinks went to full-time with Urban
Concern. We re-hired Jay Reilly as Marketing Manager for the new External Relations
Division. Heidi Ann Klingler returned to work at Xenos as a secretary. Sherri Fojas took
on a new role as Administrative Assistant for the External Relations Division. </p>

<p>We met most of our primary goals for 1995. The Servant Team grew substantially in size
and quality, and we had a very successful Servant Team retreat at the Cherry Valley Lodge
in Newark, Ohio. We also ended the year under budget. </p>

<p>In Community Development we opened the Harambee Center. We also began renovation on a
property which will provide additional office space for Urban Concern and housing for a
family from South Linden. Lou Spinks and Jim Swearingen were busy developing our strategy
for a low-income project. </p>

<p>As a part of a reorganizational strategy implemented last fall, we disassembled the
Service Division and formed a new division from one of our previous departments --
External Relations. This division provides administration, logistical support and
promotion for Xenos projects reaching out to other churches and Christian organizations. </p>

<p>Dave Merker was named coordinator of External Relations, and all other service
ministries were relocated to other divisions. In late December, we realized that it made
more sense to have Dave coordinate the Evangelism/Missions Division. Doug Patch has now
become the coordinator of External Relations. This move should provide us with focus and
the ability to serve in areas for which everyone is well suited. </p>

<h4>1996 Primary Goals</h4>

<p>External Relations has four primary objectives for the coming year. First of all, we
want to continue to establish national name recognition for certain Xenos ministries. This
will happen, in part, as we establish and build relationships with important Christian
leaders throughout the country. We also plan to form a &quot;speakers bureau&quot; for
Crossroads Project contributors and set up six speaking engagements for them. We plan to
add three exciting new Crossroads programs this year: 

<ol>
  <li>We will participate in the nationwide Teaching Church Network. TCN links proven fruitful
    churches with other churches who want to improve their effectiveness. Xenos will be a
    teaching church, and plans to mentor four developing churches over a two-year period. </li>
  <li>We will initiate a student mentoring program this fall. This program provides college
    students with the opportunity to live in a ministry house, take Xenos courses, get
    ministry experience, and be mentored by an experienced Christian worker. </li>
  <li>We will hold an Apologetics Summer Institute in July. This course will field a variety
    of Xenos speakers, and cover a number of apologetical issues relevant to current
    ideological trends. </li>
</ol>

<p>Secondly, we want to complete or have in progress eight &quot;Postmodern
Challenge&quot; conferences. We already have conferences planned for Kent State University
in February, the University of Michigan in March, and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School
in October. Our church in Cincinnati is working to set up a conference there sometime this
year. </p>

<p>Thirdly, we want to develop and promote our world-wide web sites. Already we have
hundreds of pages on our sites and there are plans to add many more. Hundreds of people
from all over the world have visited our site and the feedback we're getting is very
encouraging. </p>

<p>Finally, we want to try to market 4000 copies of <i>The Death of Truth</i>. This
important new work is scheduled for release the second week of January. Plan to attend the
signing party January 17! The book will be available at our conferences and through our
web site. We are already arranging radio interviews for some of its authors. </p>

<h3>1995-1996 Summary Financial Information</h3>

<p>1995 giving proved to be the highest ever, and exceeded budgeted collections by over

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>1995 will go down as one of the most important years in the life of our church.
Although a number of key accomplishments lay beneath the surface, or out of sight from
most members, we broke several barriers and opened new ministry that contains explosive
potential for the coming years. 

<ol>
  <li>Youth outreach has been the number one goal of our church for several years, 
    but no year has been as fruitful in this area as 1995. High school outreach 
    has resulted in a impressive 45% growth in our number of high schoolers, a 
    figure that is more remarkable when you consider that each year another class 
    graduates into the college ranks. The vast majority of this growth has been 
    convert growth from non-Xenos high schoolers. Junior high has also posted 
    heavy growth at just over 50% over the previous year. College outreach remains 
    at a lower level of growth. Pray for college outreach during 1996--including 
    our attempts to secure a more suitable site for the campus meeting. </li>
  <li>We completed the public phase of our funding drive for new facilities. Our 
    level of commitment is, according to verbal assurances from at least one bank, 
    sufficient to secure loans for both building A and B. This means ground will 
    be broken for our main building as soon as we complete a small land acquisition 
    with the city, and collect at least $750,000 in cash. (We only need about 
    $180,000 more to reach this goal). This is the end of a very painful but fruitful 
    road for our church. Look for dirt to fly this spring! </li>
  <li>We attained approval for building A and began construction. This building 
    is going to revolutionize the study center, our offices, and most importantly, 
    our student outreach. We should feel excited about what God is going to accomplish 
    through this long-awaited ministry tool. Also, morale in the church will improve 
    as we finally see action instead of words about our facility. </li>
  <li>We advanced more than 10% in giving to the general fund over the previous 
    year, thereby funding important refinements and expansion to our operation. 
    After two years of very low growth in budget, (mainly because of a church 
    division) we are again on the move. Our goal of over 12% growth in 1996 is 
    attainable and will result in more exciting results in ministry. </li>
  <li>The Crossroads Project has moved out of the research and planning phase 
    after operating two conferences and completing our book, <i>The Death of Truth</i>. 
    We are now ready to take our message in the area of apologetics to the larger 
    Christian community, with three or more conferences planned for 1996. Our 
    first Summer Apologetics Institute is also going forward in 1996, and we even 
    have a building in which to hold it. </li>
  <li>We accredited the Eastern Europe team with three couples to open ministry 
    in the former Soviet Union. This is the first full-sized team we have been 
    able to accredit since the SE Asia Team four years ago. We hope to see an 
    acceleration in missions sending now that our buildings are financed. Our 
    12.4% growth in budget goal is part of this acceleration. </li>
  <li>Huge Xenos ministries, like Urban Concern, OASIS, and Calumet Christian 
    School are carrying out their ministries in an orderly and responsible way, 
    bearing fruit and increasing in the work of God. No longer do we live in fear 
    that we could be swamped or endangered by instability in such large-scale 
    ministries. Lending institutions' willingness to loan Xenos money is a reflection 
    of the stability and maturity of these ministries, and their spiritual fruit 
    is known and treasured inside and outside Xenos. </li>
  <li>Xenos administration underwent a reorganization that should enhance our 
    efficiency and ability to accommodate more people and projects. A new Executive 
    Administrator role was given to Steve Bauer, and Doug Patch has been named 
    as a new Division Coordinator. </li>
</ol>

<p>Taken together, these major accomplishments along with scores of smaller but important
attainments constitute the turning of a new page for Xenos. It's time to rev the engines
and mobilize our church as several years of investment come to fruition. If our buildings
are completed as expected, we will be experiencing substantial new growth and new
responsibilities during 1997. The growth goal adopted by the Fiscal Support Team is a
crucial part of our overall plan for expansion. Also, the time to build the needed
leadership, training, and nurturing capabilities needed to accommodate this growth is not
in 1997 but today! Join us in thanking God for what he has allowed us to do so far, and
seeking his empowering to do even more in the near future.</p>

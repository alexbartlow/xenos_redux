    <p ALIGN="CENTER">OUR CHURCH MISSION </p>
    </font></b><dir><b><font SIZE="4">
      </font></b><font SIZE="2"><p>God has called on the church to cooperate with him as he
      reconciles the world to himself (2&nbsp;Corinthians 5:19). Therefore, Xenos Christian
      Fellowship exists to help people learn how to draw close to God. This work begins by
      inviting people to receive the gift of forgiveness offered through Christ.</p>
      <p>We are committed to fostering spiritual growth by encouraging people to respond to
      God&#146;s love through loving service toward God and all people. Specifically, we direct
      our resources to serving the family, the non-Christian community locally and
      internationally, and the broader Christian community.</p>

    <p ALIGN="CENTER">OUR CHURCH VISION</p>
    </b></font><dir><font SIZE="4"><b>
      </b></font><font SIZE="2"><p>Xenos has set out to build a highly trained, sophisticated,
      caring, leadable, cohesive, committed, and flexible work force of Christian servants who
      continually strive to serve the Lord and do his will.</p>
      </font><p>&nbsp;</p>
    </dir>
    <p>Although God reaped a steady spiritual harvest from scores of ministries and home
    groups in Xenos in 1996, the church once again failed to grow significantly in attendance.
    As expected, youth groups and OASIS saw good growth even though both were laboring in
    inadequate facilities. But the rest of the church, also in inadequate facilities,
    continued to see its growth frustrated. Strangely, we recorded many conversions through
    adult outreach ministries and at our baptisms, but these failed to affect attendance at
    our main meetings.</p>
    <p>Not with standing this problematic situation, clear signs of health and vigor indicate
    that the church is well&nbsp; and nearly ready to take the next step in fulfilling our
    mission. Class participation stood at record levels, with 1400 students attending. Giving
    reached a new high, exceeding our previous high year (1995) by 24%! (Note that much of
    this increase was the result of a large, unexpected gift). Once again, we had an operating
    surplus, which the Fiscal Support Team disbursed into needed ministry projects. Student
    groups have seen growth and have just begun using new facilities completed during the
    year. Most importantly, the Xenos Servant Team grew by 60 members, or 17%, for a total of
    420 members. The Fiscal Support Team also grew by 115 members to 508 families,
    representing a whopping 29% increase.</p>
    <p>In our work outside our own church, Xenos leaders published three more major book
    titles, and held three <i>Death of Truth</i> conferences. The first ever Summer
    Apologetics Institute was attended by over 550 paying students from central Ohio and
    around the country. The Xenos web site grew from 4000 hits per month in late 1995 to
    almost 70,000 hits per month in late 1996! Even without considering graphics files, this
    represents well over 25,000 text files per month being downloaded and examined by people
    all over the world.</p>
    <p>Given these successes, we might well conclude that growth in attendance will follow
    shortly, and that God himself may well be holding the church in check until we are more
    fully prepared for growth. The completion of our building project and the preparation of
    numerous groups for planting new groups are monumental projects which should bear abundant
    fruit soon. We are totally committed to this central strategy for our progress at this
    time. Pray that God will continue to bless our efforts on his behalf with the spiritual
    power to do what only he can do--ignite an evangelistic revival.</p>
    <p>Today we stand poised to accomplish the next phase of our mission: completing
    preparations to occupy our main facility for adults and children, while exploiting the
    newly occupied youth facilities.</p>

    <b><p>SUMMARY OF 1996</p>
        </b></font> 
        <p>1996 has been an exciting year in the Evangelism &amp; Missions Division. 
          In world missions, we made progress on several fronts. We commissioned 
          and sent a team of missionaries to the northern Eastern Europe. We brought 
          several other teams into the missionary accreditation process (Eastern 
          Europe, Brazil, England and Taiwan). We introduced two new policies 
          that will assist accredited missionaries preparing to leave: The FastTrack 
          program will enable approved missionaries to quit their jobs to raise 
          support full-time, and we committed to provide 10% of approved missionaries&#146; 
          support from the General Fund. Finally, we moved our missions director, 
          Mike Butcher, from part-time to full-time.</p>
    <p>In the area of local adult outreach, we saw more than 1000 guests attend central
    teachings, Mom&#146;s Network meetings, and/or Conversation and Cuisine events. We also
    planted one new adult group from the college ranks--the &quot;20 Something&quot; ministry
    team. And over 50 people were baptized at the Fellowship-wide baptism.</p>
    <p>Urban Concern purchased and began reconstruction of the first house for our Housing
    Program. We established a &quot;Home Ownership&quot; program for South Linden residents.
    Renovation of a new facility entered the final stage.</p>
    <p>On the negative side, central teachings did not grow. Delays in construction have
    forced us to stay in our current facilities until next fall, which has negatively affected
    central teaching growth. Our efforts to effectively follow-up guests at central teachings
    fell somewhat short. We have introduced measures which should help correct this problem in
    the coming year. Some of our expansion plans for missions had to be put off until next
    year: developing a training track, developing a short-term missions program, and visiting
    teams on the field. And due to leadership hardship, we had to dis-accredit the &quot;Grace
    on Gray&quot; ministry team (though the ministry will continue on an unofficial basis).</p>
    <font SIZE="2"><p><b>1997 PRIMARY GOALS</b></p>
    </font><p>In 1997, the Evangelism &amp; Missions Division will make preparations for
    growth. Construction of the Main Campus facility should be completed by late summer or
    early fall. At that point we anticipate significant growth in our central teachings. In
    order to show up in our new facility ready for growth, we will implement programs to
    enhance the follow-up and incorporate of central teaching guests and outfit the Main
    Campus for after-meeting fellowship and follow-up.</p>
    <p>We also hope to plant yet another post-college outreach group, and advance plans to
    open up a fourth central teaching at the Main Campus and one on the west side of town.</p>
    <p>We will continue to administer the fellowship-wide baptism, and we hope to baptize over
    200 new people. We will cooperate in the production of the Summer Evangelism Institute. We
    will convene an extra-local church council with our groups from Cincinnati, Cleveland,
    Dayton and Zanesville. And we&#146;ll try to replicate our effective outreach through the
    Mom&#146;s Playgroup and Conversation and Cuisine networks.</p>
        <p>In missions, we hope to accredit and send the South <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Eastern 
          Europe</font>, Brazil and England teams, while also advancing our Taiwan 
          team&#146;s preparations. We will introduce a short-term missions strategy, 
          a missionary training track, and a program for visiting teams on the 
          field. Finally, we will be encouraging outreach groups in communities 
          within an hour&#146;s driving time of Columbus.</p>
    <p>Urban Concern has marked 1997 as the year to &quot;pause and polish&quot; their
    existing programs. We will make organizational and administrative changes to enhance
    ministries already in place. We will add classes to the South Linden Bible Study and
    After-School programs. And we will do our part to ready two families for home ownership. <dir>

      </b></font></dir>
      <font SIZE="2"><p>This division seeks to reach non-Christian students for
      Christ while developing workers and leaders for Christ's church.</p>
    </font></dir><font SIZE="2">
    <b><p>SUMMARY OF 1996</p>
    </b></font><p>God gave us 23% overall growth in our junior high, senior high and college
    ministries. Though we are thankful for this growth, it was less than our desired goal. The
    inability to get into our new high school facility until late this fall hurt growth in the
    high school ministry. Most groups did well with outreach. We hope to continue this in
    1997, while improving our follow-up of newer students.</p>
    <p>The high school group moved into our new student facility in October, while the campus
    central teaching moved its headquarters to a leased facility on East 16th Ave. Both spaces
    are much nicer and give us room to at least double in size. Initial attendance records are
    promising! We also leased Building 9 in September of 1995, which helped OASIS squeeze 60
    additional children into regular attendance. As a result the OASIS program grew by almost
    60 children in 1996.</p>
    <p>About 50 junior high students are now attending two new meetings during the 11 am
    Sunday and Tuesday central teachings. Initial responses to the new meetings have been
    favorable. 25% of these students do not attend the Sunday night Blow-Out meeting. </p>
    <p>The &quot;College &amp; Career&quot; ministry team (DeLashmutt) planted a post-college
    home group (Buterbaugh) in February. The Buck McCallum/Robinson home church, along with
    the Downs home church, combined efforts to plant a post-college group (Sullivan) this past
    October. The parent churches and the newly planted groups are all doing well. </p>
    <font SIZE="2"><b><p>1997 PRIMARY GOALS</p>
    </b></font><p>We want to fill up our new facilities! With our new youth facility, we hope
    to see the high school ministry grow by 50 students. We will focus on outreach and
    training the students to invest in the lives of their non-Christian high school friends.
    With our newly acquired OSU campus facility, we hope to win another 50 students through
    the central teachings and home churches. </p>
    <p>At Calumet Christian School (CCS), we are presently developing an expansion plan to
    accommodate the growing enrollment for the 1997-98 school year. Several different plans
    are being reviewed by the CCS board, who will also develop a 3-5 year expansion plan by
    mid-year.</p>
    <p>The OASIS directors are excited about moving into our new facility, where the class
    room space will almost double. Therefore, volunteer staff recruitment will be a top
    priority this summer to insure readiness for the anticipated growth after the move.</p>
    <p>This summer we hope to send fifty high school students on a ten-day missions project in
    Mexico, and thirty junior high students on a seven-day work project in Tennessee. The
    trips will also help accomplish our mission by forming lifelong attitudes of sacrificial
    giving among the participating students. </p>
    <p>We will also launch the <i>Real Life</i> program in 1997. <i>Real Life </i>offers an
    alternative to Christian College education. This year we hope to enroll six extra-local
    students who will live in a college ministry house, take our course work (Christian
    Principles, etc.), attend a local college (OSU, Columbus State, Franklin U.) and be
    mentored by an adult member in Xenos. These students will spend three to four years here,
    after which they will bring their Xenos experience back to their local churches. </p>

      spiritual care to Xenos members, encouraging them toward normative Christian maturity.</p>
    </font></dir><font SIZE="2">
    <b><p>SUMMARY OF 1996 </p>
    </b></font><p>The net number of people in home groups grew by just over 40 people from
    last year. Some of these people joining groups recently became Christians. We now stand at
    1158 people in Pastoral home groups (this number does not include college nor adult
    evangelistic ministry teams). This year, we added 5 new home groups, but 8 groups ended
    (mostly through some weakened groups merging with stronger groups). We now have 51
    pastoral home groups.</p>
    <p>In spite of last year&#146;s small growth, general morale among home group leaders is
    some of the best we've had in half a decade or more. Many leaders are anticipating growth
    in their groups as they reach out through ministries like <i>Conversation and Cuisine</i>.
    Whereas a year and a half ago only a third of the home groups had cell groups (men &amp;
    women study groups), most have them today. We have seen a number of leaders return to a
    personal discipleship paradigm. This is a good sign of health, but we need more happening
    here. Quarterly enhancement nights grew this year and have served our leaders well,
    invigorating them with the vision for growing and planting their groups. Our
    soon-to-be-completed auditorium reminded group leaders that possibly many new folks will
    need incorporation into home groups in the coming months. 21 of our home groups have
    drafted plans to plant their groups, and we anticipate more such plant plans. </p>
    <p>The Servant Team grew by 60 this year and is at 420 deacons now. The flow of new
    deacons has been steady, and demonstrates wide-spread vitality in the church. Servant Team
    monthly meetings showed somewhat better attendance over last year.</p>
    <p>The counseling department developed new biblical counseling and marital counseling
    class-work to equip people to effectively counsel each other. We knew that these classes
    would be popular, but even our high expectations were exceeded.</p>
    <font SIZE="2"><b><p>1997 PRIMARY GOALS</p>
    </b></font><p>The need for more home groups will probably rise significantly as we move
    into the new building next year. We hope to plant 10 new groups in 1997, and 12-15 more in
    1998. It will be crucial to develop Christian workers who are willing to trust God to help
    lead new groups. This is one of the greatest needs of the church for 1997, if we are to
    capitalize on the growth opportunity afforded by our new facility.</p>
    <p>We will hire a full time Home Group Supervisor/ Incorporator to help new people find
    groups and to oversee new groups next year. Even so, we must rely heavily on more people
    in home groups who will make the extra effort to meet new people they don't know at
    central teachings.</p>
    <p>The new Servant Team 2-year covenant will take shape early 1997, and the Servant Team
    will vote on what changes in the team. We expect another strong flow of new deacons this
    year to build on an already strong core of the church. Servant Team members, meanwhile,
    need to keep up on their commitments.</p>
    <p>Katey Downs is quite busy with about as many clients as she can see in a given week.
    Because of this, the counseling department received the green light to hire another
    counselor on an &quot;if-needed&quot; basis. </p>
    <p>Besides offering support to our own members, we hope to develop new inroads into our
    community by publicizing the <i>DivorceCare </i>series, single parents, new singles
    ministries, and men's and women's ministries.</p>
    <p>We hope to build on the successful parent/child meal-Bible study concept by doing more
    events this year. This will help parents build better spiritual and relational bonds with
    their children. <dir>

      </b></font></dir>
      <font SIZE="2"><p>The Equipping Division provides educational resources for
      Christians to understand and apply biblical truth to their lives, and to prepare for a
      fruitful ministry.</p>
    </font></dir><font SIZE="2">
    <b><p>SUMMARY OF 1996</p>
    </b></font><p>1996 has been an exciting year in the Equipping Division. We met our goal of
    1400 annual registrants and 6 course offerings per quarter in the adult education program.
    We currently have our largest Christian Principles class ever (130), up from the 100
    we&#146;ve averaged over the previous two years. This is a sign of spiritual vitality for
    Xenos, as many of these young Christians will become active contributors to ministry teams
    and members of the Servant Team. Enrollment in Challenge Groups remains high this year as
    nearly half of the Servant Team is now involved.</p>
    <p>The Study Center has completed its move to the new facility. Along with an
    extraordinary view of our property, new furniture and a cozy fireplace, we also have
    greatly enhanced tools for study. Three Pentium computers, loaded with state-of-the-art
    Bible study programs, access the Internet and Windows 95 make the Study Center a complete
    resource for individual and group study. Study Center director Rob Dixon has expressed
    concern about low levels of use over the past couple of years. He is busily planning for
    growth in 1997, centering on the value of our new location and newly acquired resources.</p>
    <p>Ministry NetWorking launched the first ministry fair this year. It was very well
    received, both by the 52 ministry teams that had a booth and by the hundreds of people who
    showed up to see what ministries Xenos is involved in. This is the last ministry fair
    Sherri Fojas will administer, as she pursues her career as a full-time mom. We wish Sherri
    well and thank her for her many years of distinguished service on the Xenos staff.</p>
    <p>The Crossroads Project, Xenos&#146; apologetics ministry, had a very busy year. While
    we did not reach our goal of 4 &quot;Death of Truth&quot; conferences, the two that were
    held were very well received. We had numerous publications, beginning the year with the
    release of our multi-authored work, <i>The Death of Truth</i> (Bethany House Publishers)
    and 10 articles in Christian magazines and journals. The Summer Apologetics Institute far
    exceeded our expectations. People from nine states participated in the two week program
    that featured three prominent Christian apologists, William Lane Craig, Hugh Ross and
    Grant Osborne. </p>
    <font SIZE="2"><p><b>1997 PRIMARY GOALS</b></p>
    </font><p>In 1997, the Equipping Division will build on the programs and services
    developed over the past two years. The adult education department has set a goal 1400
    registrants in classes and one-third of the Servant Team to take a Challenge Group. After
    a year of intense study and preparation, Patrice McCormac will offer the Christian
    Principles course on Friday mornings. This will be ideal for stay-at-home moms, people
    working second and third shifts, and retirees. </p>
    <p>The Study Center has targeted an ambitious 200 member growth for 1997. With the
    substantial support given to the Study Center by the Fiscal Support Team, we believe that
    the location and enhanced resources will be increasingly attractive to Xenos members. We
    are also putting some new programs in place that should attract interest both from within
    the fellowship and in the local Christian community.</p>
    <p>Ministry NetWorking will undergo some changes in keeping with a church that is in the
    process of change. Rob Dixon will include NetWorking in his administrative role in the
    Equipping Division. He will oversee the same projects as last year, but will also develop
    an interactive information center for the new Auditorium, intended to make awareness of
    and connection with our 60+ ministry teams much easier.</p>
    <p>The Crossroads Project will hold three conferences for 1997. Two are already scheduled.
    We will continue our research and publications on cultural issues that witnessing
    Christians need to understand. The Summer Evangelism Institute will broaden last
    year&#146;s emphasis on apologetics to include some more practical tools for reaching our
    postmodern world. We have also shortened it to nine days, down from two weeks. <dir>

        <font SIZE="4"><b><p>EXTERNAL RELATIONS DIVISION </p>
      </b></font></dir>
      <font SIZE="2"><p>External Relations facilitates the equipping of the Christian
      community beyond Xenos by providing promotional and logistical support to Xenos equipping
      projects, and by cooperating with other Christian organizations in their ministries when
      requested.</p>
    </font></dir><font SIZE="2">
    <b><p>SUMMARY OF 1996</p>
    </b></font><p>This year represented a mixed-bag of goal accomplishment for External
    Relations. We learned a lot and God has solidified our vision. We have made many new
    friends and contacts in the Christian community nationally, and God has been affirming
    this ministry through many of them.</p>
    <p>We fell short of our goal to move 4,000 copies of <i>The Death of Truth </i>through
    sales or promotions, though we did move 3000 copies. This nationally published book became
    a lynch-pin to promoting our conferences, the Summer Apologetics Institute, and the Xenos
    name in general. The newly formed Contact Team was instrumental in book promotion and we
    thank them for their great work. <i>The Death of Truth </i>has done well enough nationally
    that Bethany House has authorized a second printing.</p>
    <p>Our goal to hold 8 out-of-town <i>Death of Truth </i>conferences proved too lofty. The
    travel required for promoting and holding this many conferences was too time intensive to
    maintain. As a result, the elders approved a reduced goal of 2 or 3 away conferences per
    year. We held conferences at Kent State University, and Trinity Evangelical Divinity
    School in Chicago with over 170 attending each. We also held a mini-conference at Ohio
    State. We met the 1996 promotion goals for 1997 conferences by securing conferences in
    Denver and Lincoln (Illinois) for 1997. We also have strong leads on conferences in Dallas
    and Vancouver for 1998.</p>
    <p>We exceeded the goal of providing logistical and promotional support to Crossroads'
    Summer Apologetics Institute. Over 550 people attended, compared with the goal of 200,
    coming from seven other states besides Ohio. Thanks to Sherri Fojas, Heidi Ann Klingler,
    and Carolyn Voelker who made this two-week conference hum with efficiency. We are also
    grateful for the many other volunteers who gave sacrificially to this ministry.</p>
    <p>Response to our World Wide Web sites has exceeded our greatest expectations. The number
    of people accessing the sites each month has increased fifteen-fold--from several hundred
    in January to tens of thousands in December. We also increased the content of the sites
    four-fold. Site visitors have been consistently positive in their feedback, especially
    appreciating that we share our materials without charge. Book sales and conference
    registration have also been enhanced through this ministry. Jay Reilly, with the help of
    volunteers, has managed and modified these sites regularly.</p>
    <font SIZE="2"><b><p>1997 PRIMARY GOALS</p>
    </b></font><p>In addition to helping other Christian workers through the above ministries,
    we also hope that through these ministries God will draw Christians to become involved in
    our programs here in Columbus. We desire to be known as a training center for Christian
    workers. Our 1997 goals aim to further both of these ends.</p>
    <p>The Summer Apologetics Institute&#146;s name has been changed to Summer Evangelism
    Institute<i>.</i> We plan to appeal to a wider range of attendees by providing more
    breadth in our topics. This year&#146;s conference will also be accessible to working
    people since five of its ten days are weekend days. William Lane Craig has agreed to
    return, and other noted speakers have already been invited. Our new Office &amp; Study
    Center building will host most of the SEI, and provide a much more appealing environment
    for learning. We will be thrilled with attendance similar to last year&#146;s conference.</p>
    <p>In 1997, we will begin an exciting new step in equipping Christians outside Xenos. The
    Real Life mentoring program provides Christian undergrad students an opportunity to be
    equipped for ministry while simultaneously attending a local secular college. Their
    involvement in our campus Bible study, Christian Principles classes, ministry house
    living, and access to an adult mentor will help them learn how to be a light shining in
    the midst of our secular culture. External Relations' promotions will hopefully attract
    six Christian college students into this program while attending a local college. Our
    promotions will also be directed toward bringing at least twice that many students in the
    fall of 1998.</p>
    <p>We will hold two out of town <i>Death of Truth </i>conferences in 1997--at Denver on
    February 7,8, and at Lincoln (Illinois) on October 7,8. The conference has improved
    significantly by increasing its practical impact and interest for the lay person.
    Scheduling more conferences may spread our personnel too thin when we need to prepare for
    the upcoming move to the new facility.</p>
    <p>The promotion of <i>The Death of Truth</i> will remain a key in External Relations'
    goal of acquainting the wider church with Xenos and The Crossroads Project. Its content
    directly relates to the conference ministry and to the type of apologetics and evangelism
    equipping we want to provide students in the Real Life program. We hope to move 2000
    copies of <i>The</i> <i>Death of Truth </i>through sales and promotions. We will expand
    the Contact Team in order to accomplish this. We will promote the other Xenos-authored
    books in a similar fashion.</p>
    <p>Our web sites will come under new management. ATGi (a local web access and development
    company) will manage the sites' incredible growth in size and activity by organizing,
    maintaining, and enhancing our content and look. As a result, our equipping and promotions
    through the World Wide Web should be even more effective in 1997 than the previous year. <dir>

        <font SIZE="4"><b><p>OPERATIONS DIVISION</p>
      </b></font></dir>
      <font SIZE="2"><p>The Xenos Operations Division provides administrative
      support, communications, and facilities, helping focus the ministries conducted by our
      church staff and members.</p>
    </font></dir><font SIZE="2">
    <b><p>SUMMARY OF 1996</p>
    </b></font><p>The past year was certainly a challenging and exciting one. We faced the
    prospect of supporting on-going core programs and our church&#146;s growing ministry in
    existing facilities--while building new ones. The single most consuming project for the
    entire division was the development and completion of our new Office-Study Center-Student
    facility. At year-end, we were finally situated in our new environment, ready to face the
    new year in more productive, spacious (and beautiful) work space.</p>
    <p>Several individuals within the Operations division spent over half of each day on
    issues related to our building projects. We spent even more energy developing the legal
    agreements related to the signing of a commitment to sell part of our eastern property. </p>
    <p>Operation&#146;s Facilities Development and Maintenance Department worked incredibly
    hard to make sure we maintained high levels of service in our bulging existing leased
    facilities, as we made our transition out to our church-owned places. John Circle wore
    many hats in the facilities area this year; he was our &quot;point-man&quot; on our
    building projects and oversaw our meeting spaces. We faced an assortment of building
    challenges, including uncooperative weather and difficulty working with our chosen
    construction manager. We did learn a great deal about what we did not want our larger
    building project to be like. That experience has paid dividends as we started work on the
    Main Campus building in September. </p>
    <p>Office management took a massive step forward as we completed some <i>real</i> offices,
    and as Cathy Kaiser took the reigns of creating an environment in which we can all work
    productively. Thanks to so many volunteers, the move came off very well, and now we are in
    a place were we can grow and thrive in God&#146;s service.</p>
    <p>Our Sound &amp; Light department supported the myriad of seminars and presentations we
    give, along with the stage and sound at central teachings, retreats and many other events.
    In an organization that thrives on thinking on its feet, director Mark Grover worked to
    improve our ability to respond and to plan ahead. At the same time, the sound systems
    implemented for the office and study center consumed a large amount of effort. The design
    for Main Campus also required extensive input.</p>
    <p>Media &amp; Graphics (formerly Media Concepts) enhanced its ability to provide
    communication media within the church (through the Weekly Update and the Exchange), and to
    the external world. Chris Lang supported initiatives within External Relations and
    Equipping to present the Crossroads project through professional brochures and related
    publications. We also began to experiment in the use of digital media, with more to come
    in the future.</p>
    <p>Maximizing our considerable investment in information technology continues to be a
    battle, with more time needed before these tools reach their real potential. Our systems
    director, Andy Ault, focused on the automated information tools the church needs to
    effectively administrate our work. Andy also headed up an amazing team of volunteers who
    helped wire and connect our office network in a very cost-effective and incredibly
    professional manner. </p>
    <p>Our church fiscal controller, Alan Burkholder, headed the professional staff as they
    maintained our systems for financial accounting, safe-guarding our assets and reporting to
    management and the church. As a result, as in 1995 the Fiscal Support Team shared in the
    exciting task of deciding how to allocate $100,000 of &quot;black-ink&quot; to
    Christ-centered ministry. This sum was available because management spent under budget,
    and because collections were over budget. Accounting and finance retained excellent
    service while implementing new benefit programs and under-going a full external audit. The
    audit proved what we really knew all along-- we have an outstanding grasp of what it takes
    to manage and report on our finances, in full compliance with all applicable rules and
    regulations. We do not plan on having another external audit done in the near future, but
    we will maintain our high, professional standards.</p>
    <p>Our division also continued to support our building campaign. Collections remained
    on-track, but efforts to involve more of our members in the campaign on a pledged basis
    were not as successful as we had hoped. We were also unable to focus much time or energy
    into increasing participation, as our resource remained consumed with the actual building
    project.</p>
    <p>In 1996, our church administrative management worked to determine the proper balance
    between responsibilities of the executive administrator, the senior elders and the
    division coordinators. Progress was made in defining roles and responsibilities, but
    additional work remains.</p>
    <font SIZE="2"><p><b>1997 PRIMARY GOALS</b></p>
    </font><p>In 1997, the Operations Division will focus on laying down a solid
    infrastructure for our future by providing a productive working environment for our staff
    and volunteers and enhancing the levels of support we provide to each department. We set
    forth many plans, especially at the Fiscal Support Team Retreat, that will require
    division assistance and funding. This work impacts each and every of the aforementioned
    departments. </p>
    <p>1997 will certainly include intense activity on the final design and completion of our
    new Main Campus facility. The division coordinator will have overall responsibility for
    delivery of the facility. The Facilities Department will maintain a very active role in
    the development cycle and transition planning. Sound &amp; Light will work almost
    full-time on the building as we enter the final three months of building activity. </p>
    <p>In addition to the completion of our building project, we will also strive to sell a
    few out-parcels of our land. We have been contemplating this action since 1992. With the
    start of design for the Main Campus building, the elders decided to expand the design to
    fully meet our current needs for space, and to provide for some room for growth. In order
    to finance this expanded version of the building, we have moved more aggressively to sell
    some premium development property that has less value to us from our overall plans for the
    use of our land. A sale will be consummated in 1997 to bring in additional funds for our
    expanded project.</p>
    <p>We will continue to meet on-going goals related to facilitating ministry in each of the
    other church divisions. This will be accomplished through each of the departments that
    comprise the Operations Division. In particular, we will focus on refining operating and
    usage guidelines for all of our facilities. We want to maximize the use of what God has
    given us, while still maintaining the integrity and security of our facility assets. This
    is a tough area to control, knowing that we have many excellent uses for the facilities,
    but limited resources to maintain and enhance them.</p>
    <p>We also want to maximize the productivity available from our information technology
    tools. In this day of the internet and fast-paced technology evolution, we need to make
    the most of what we have already, and make smart decisions about where to invest. Better
    tools for staff and church leaders are key to facing the challenges of the growth we
    expect. Along with technology, we know that our staff needs to be supported materially,
    trained in job skills and motivated to achieve the goals set before us. Operations will
    support that need in 1997 through more focused full-time office management and improved
    human resource planning.</p>
    <p>Our accounting department will continue to focus on timely reporting. We will also
    develop better reporting formats and tools for use by the division coordinators and their
    staff.</p>
    <p>Much of what the division tries to accomplish will not be possible without the many
    volunteers who come forward to help. 1997 will see the formation of ministry teams in
    facilities maintenance, cleaning and traffic control. Of course, we will seek help for our
    huge move from the current Sinclair Road facilities. We will also pull together a human
    resource team to look at staff needs, help plan approaches to those needs. The office will
    also continue to seek out willing helpers, without whom we could not operate the office in
    a productive, responsive mode.</p>
    <p>In 1997, we will refine the role of the senior elders in running daily church
    operations, and further clarify the role of the executive administrator. This process will
    involve time with the divisions coordinators determining needs and approaches to meeting
    those needs. The church&#146;s board of elders will spend time looking at organizational
    issues and potential improvements fostered through changed roles and responsibilities. We
    will also continue to seek out input from others churches and related organizations. As we
    look toward the end results of our work in this area, we look forward to the creation of a
    much more effective organization. The organization will better leverage the gifting of
    administrative support, while freeing more of the senior elders&#146; time to share their
    gifting with the church and community at-large. Our effectiveness in this area will be
    measured in large part from the feedback we receive back our staff, and those we serve.</p>
    <font SIZE="4"><b><p>1996 Summary Financial Information </p>
    </b></font><p>1996 giving proved to be the highest ever, and exceeded budgeted collections
    by over $100,000. However, apart from a large unexpected gift, giving fell about $60,000
    short of budgeted collections. In addition, division coordinators met their goals while
    spending under their budgets by about $50,000. The December Fiscal Support Team retreat

      </font></b><font SIZE="2"><p>God has called on the church to cooperate with him as he
      reconciles the world to himself (2&nbsp;Corinthians 5:19). Therefore, Xenos Christian
      Fellowship exists to help people learn how to draw close to God. This work begins by
      inviting people to receive the gift of forgiveness offered through Christ.</p>
      <p>We are committed to fostering spiritual growth by encouraging people to respond to
      God&#146;s love through loving service toward God and all people. Specifically, we direct
      our resources to serving the family, the non-Christian community locally and
      internationally, and the broader Christian community.</p></font>

      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>Growth in attendance has been a sore point in Xenos since 1992. This year, we appear to
    have grown by around 600 people since the same time last year! Compared to last
    fall&#146;s attendance of around 2400, this represents 25% growth in one year. That rate
    compares favorably with the best years of growth our church has ever seen. Opening the new
    building and excellent performance in student outreach seem to be the main outward factors
    leading to the phenomenal growth. The initial surge of curiosity about the new building
    appears to have subsided, making today&#146;s attendance a fairly reliable number.</p>
    <p><img SRC="../../graphics/97arpchart.gif" WIDTH="362" HEIGHT="242"> In addition to growth in attendance, Xenos has
    increased its budget. The fiscal support team has increased spending substantially during
    the past three years, partly in recognition of the following facts: <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Xenos has been under-funded in the past, including underpaid staff.</li>
        <li>Xenos has been disorganized and short handed in administrative staff.</li>
        <li>Xenos has been unacceptably weak in missions.</li>
        <li>Our student outreach had to be resuscitated, partly by using paid staff.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>These increases were voted in faith that we would soon see growth resulting from our
    ministry initiatives and from our building campaign. This year, we see the increased
    spending bearing fruit in all needed areas as well as growth. </p>
    <p>This year, instead of trying to figure out how to <i>get</i> the ball rolling, we have
    to think about increase calculated to <i>keep</i> the ball rolling. We need to be
    forward-thinking to maintain our ministry momentum without again getting caught behind as
    we were several years ago. This is why the Fiscal Support Team passed an aggressive growth
    budget again for 1998&#151;a plan that should keep us abreast of all that God wants to do
    in the church. Below we survey that plan, along with synopses of the past year&#146;s
    developments divided by the six divisions in the church. </p>
    <p>Notice that we have changed the divisions around a bit, moving the External Relations
    division to department status and dividing the former Evangelism and Missions division
    into the Evangelism division (Central Teachings, Adult outreach, External relations) and
    the Missions division (World Ministries, Urban Concern, International Student Services,
    and Domestic Missions). This represents a shift of emphasis from external relations to
    missions and evangelism. Doug Patch moved over from his position as coordinator of the old
    External Relations division to coordinator the new Evangelism division. Dave Merker will
    coordinate the new Missions division. Since the change was made around the end of 1997,
    the review of 1997 is presented under the old arrangement, while the goals for 1998 are
    presented under the new arrangement.</p>

    <b><p>Dave Merker, Coordinator</p>
    <p>SUMMARY OF 1997</p>
    </b></font><p>This division was responsible for transitioning the Adult Central Teachings
    to their new home with the opening of the Main Campus facility. We kicked off the move
    with a &quot;Grand Opening&quot; event. During the three Grand Opening meetings about 4700
    adults and over 2000 children showed up.</p>
    <p>The Grand Opening was a festive affair. Those in attendance must have consumed about a
    ton of tasty chicken wings and other culinary delights, and we gave away scores of Xenos
    mugs and <i>Christianity: The Faith That Makes Sense</i> books. We really appreciate all
    the help offered by dozens and dozens of volunteers.</p>
    <p>On other fronts, we are happy to report that Evangelism/Missions adult outreach teams
    grew in numbers. About 1000 guests attended &quot;Conversation &amp; Cuisine&quot; and
    &quot;Playgroup Network&quot; events in 1997. Large numbers of these guests are now
    involved in Central Teachings and home groups.</p>
        <p>On the mission front, we sent two couples to Eastern Europe. We also were 
          able to visit our teams in Southeast Asia and Brazil. And we accredited 
          Mark &amp; Steph Watkins who  will be serving in Brazil. </p>
    <p>Many new Christians gave their testimonies at this year&#146;s baptism. One hundred
    adults stepped out in faith to publicly proclaim their relationship with Christ. It was a
    sweet night of rejoicing&#151;even though many, many others could have been baptized!</p>
    <p>Urban Concern launched a new an adult outreach ministry called &quot;Word in the
    Hood.&quot; Also, the craftsmen involved with our low-income housing program completed
    renovation of a house as others helped prepare some families for home ownership. Our first
    family is about to complete the process of qualifying to buy a house.</p>
    <p>Other Urban Concern programs had a good year. For instance, the &quot;Kids on
    Track&quot; job readiness program was offered to about 35 youths. The South Linden Bible
    Study reached an all time attendance high in October when about 200 youths came out. And
    more than a dozen families participated in the Home Buyers club.</p>

    <p>1998 PRIMARY GOALS</p>
        </b></font> 
        <p>In 1998, the Missions Division will pursue the goal of &quot;upsetting 
          the world&quot; for Christ (see Acts 17:6). We&#146;ll do this in part 
          by sending additional workers to existing foreign ministries including 
          Mark &amp; Steph Watkins to Brazil, one couple to Southeast Asia, and 
          one to <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Eastern 
          Europe</font>. We hope to formally accredit a team to be sent to Taiwan, 
          a new field for Xenos. Finally, we&#146;ll do some major research to 
        identify a new unreached people group to reach out to.</p>
    <p>Launching our short-term sending strategy should also help the cause. We have plans to
    cooperate with Student Ministries to send a couple of student teams to foreign countries.
    And we&#146;re working on a plan to send one adult/family team out to do a short-term
    project.</p>
    <p>Short-term mission trips heighten awareness about the need for Christ in other corners
    of the world. They enrich our understanding and vision for what God is doing to reach the
    lost outside of central Ohio. Many career missionaries got their vision for world
    evangelization after participating in a short-term mission.</p>
    <p>To be effective at upsetting the world for Christ, we need to be equipped. So several
    key missions staff and leaders will engage in some serious study this year. We&#146;ll
    attend some conferences and take some seminary classes. This should help us get a better
    feel for what&#146;s new in missions. We want to stay on the cutting edge.</p>
    <p>Local cross-cultural work should flourish this year. With the generous funding supplied
    by the Fiscal Support Team and other Xenos givers, we should be able to provide quite a
    bit of help to our ministry to international students. We&#146;re looking to see their
    Bible study attendance increase by more than 25 people. In fact we&#146;re looking to see
    the &quot;Word in the Hood&quot; (Urban Concern&#146;s new adult outreach ministry), the
    South Linden Bible Study, First Frontier (Dayton home group), Zanesville, and adult prison
    ministries all grow significantly this next year.</p>
    <p>Urban Concern programs will continue to press ahead with ministry to the needy of South
    Linden. Some of our well-established and better-known ministries include the After-School
    and One-on-One programs. We should see expansion in each of these this next year. In
    addition, we&#146;re looking for great things from some relatively new Urban Concern
    ministries. Low income housing should renovate and sell more houses, young adult ministry
    houses should grow, more research should go into starting an inner city school, and we
    should complete development of a job training and placement program. <dir>

    <p>SUMMARY OF 1997</p>
    </b></font><p>From September 1996 to September 1997, God gave us 22% overall growth in our
    junior high, senior high and college ministries. We are thankful for the growth in all of
    our groups, even though it is lower than our 36% growth goal. We are still hoping to do
    better this coming year by growing an additional 40%. </p>
    <p>The OASIS program accomplished a major goal: moving into the new facility! Because the
    number of classrooms was going to almost double, teacher recruitment was a top
    priority&#151;but with God&#146;s help we met the goal. And, with the increased space,
    this program grew by 131 children since November of 1996. Also, after three hard years, we
    completed the curriculum development.</p>
    <p>Xenos Christian Schools is now a reality and the name of our new school system! Because
    of growing enrollment at Calumet Christian School, the administration was able to start an
    additional school on our main campus&#151;Xenos Christian School. We accommodated scores
    of additional students through this newly state-chartered school. </p>
    <p>Our new Melee program, a five-week summer outreach to fourth and fifth grade boys, was
    a tremendous success. Each week, a majority of our Xenos kids brought their unchurched
    friends. In 1998, we plan to sponsor this program on a monthly basis.</p>
    <p>At the junior high level, we&#146;re seeing record numbers in the cell groups, the Blow
    Out meetings, and JAM. Since last year, our large meeting, the Blow Out, grew by 34
    students, and almost every one was unchurched. 25 of them also reported to have received
    Christ! Many other new students still need salvation and more on-going body life in our
    cell groups.</p>
    <p>The high school group moved into our new student facility just over a year ago, and the
    fruit has been incredible. Due to the hard work of our staff, volunteers, and space, we
    are seeing over 150 high schoolers pile into our new facility each week&#151;something not
    possible with our smaller building. Since last year, the group has grown by 64 students,
    and most of this growth is unchurched students! 25 of these students said they received
    Christ, most of whom joined a cell group. The challenge this year will be to incorporate
    the latest batch of new students into our cell groups.</p>
        <p>Our college outreach experienced surprisingly slow growth early this fall, 
          but since then growth has picked up some. Since last year at this time, 
          home churches have grown by 28 students, while our Central Teaching 
          has only grown by 10. Dennis McCallum became the new director since 
          our previous director, Scot McCallum, was called to the Eastern Europe 
        Mission Team.</p>
    <font SIZE="2"><b><p>1998 PRIMARY GOALS</p>
    </b></font><p>We want to fill up our new facilities! This year we hope to add hundreds to
    our student programs while taking measures to manage the growth and build effectively.</p>
    <p>At OASIS, we want to successfully manage the program growth. We are adding an assistant
    director to help us in this area. </p>
    <p>At Xenos Christian School, we hope to increase enrollment by 50 more students and
    expand three more grades (3rd, 4th, and 5th) at the north campus. We will also introduce
    new and improved curriculum in Math and Language Arts.</p>
    <p>The junior high programs should grow by 50 students. In order to secure this growth, we
    need improvements in follow-up and meeting programming. A part-time hire will help us
    here. The leadership hopes to build solidly by planting between four and six cell groups.</p>
    <p>The main goal for high school work will be to incorporate all of the new outreach. To
    that end, we hope to recruit several college age and adult workers to lead the several new
    cell groups waiting to be planted. If our recruitment effort fails, we will have to invent
    new cell group paradigms.</p>
    <p>This year we hope to enroll 10 extra-local students in our Real Life program. This
    program, an alternative to Christian college education, involves living in a college
    ministry house, taking our course work (Christian Principles, etc.), attending a local
    college (OSU or Columbus State) and being mentored by an adult member in Xenos. </p>
    <p>To remedy the slow growth in our in our college ministry, we will multiply home
    churches and ministry houses. We hope to plant 2 new home churches and 7 ministry houses. <dir>

    <b><p>Phil Franck, Coordinator</p>
    <p>SUMMARY OF 1997</p>
    </b></font><p>Home group attendance is up 150 over last year at this time. This year, we
    planted 8 new home groups and gained a ninth through assimilating an existing group.
    (These figures do not include the several hundred more attending student and adult
    outreach groups). This is more pastoral division home groups planted in one year than in
    the previous five years! We did lose 3 groups, mostly because they were smaller, weakened
    groups hitting bad circumstances. We now have 59 pastoral home groups.</p>
    <p>The number of people at Central Teachings inquiring about getting into home groups has
    sky-rocketed. We had the same number of inquirees in the first 2 months of our new
    facility as we had seen in the previous 12 months at the old building. Between September 1
    (when we opened the new facility) and the week before Christmas, we've had 188 inquiries
    about home groups. Of that number, we've referred roughly 3 out of 5 inquirers to groups
    and confirmed placement of roughly 1 in 5 so far.</p>
    <p>We hired John Cleary, who has contributed strongly in home group connection work. We
    have seen a number of leaders return to a personal discipleship paradigm. This is a good
    sign of health, but we need more here. Danny Walker's quarterly enhancement nights grew
    this year and have served our leaders well, invigorating them with the vision for growing
    and planting their groups. Over half of our home groups have drafted plans to plant their
    groups, and we anticipate more such plant plans.</p>
    <p>The Servant Team grew by 66 this year to a total of 489 deacons. The flow of new
    deacons has been steady, and demonstrates wide-spread vitality in the church. </p>
    <p>In the counseling department, we added Bruce Shively to the staff as a part-time
    counselor, and he and Katey Downs saw over 200 different individuals or couples this year.</p>
    <font SIZE="2"><b><p>1998 PRIMARY GOALS</p>
    </b></font><p>This year is the big year for growth. The two big growth issues are: <ol>
      <li>Home groups need to grow by incorporating people from Central Teachings as well as
        through group-generated outreach. Many groups have room to grow, or with some adjustments,
        could make the room to take in new people. Even though we hope to increase our Home Group
        Connection &quot;presence&quot; at the Central Teachings to further help people get into
        home groups, Xenos members should make a point to reach out and warmly meet new people
        sitting around them at Central Teachings. </li>
      <li>With the opening of the new building, we need more new home groups. We hope to plant 8
        more new groups in 1998, and 12-15 more in 1999. It will be crucial to develop Christian
        workers who are willing to trust God to help lead new groups. These are a couple of the
        greatest needs of the church for 1998 if we are to capitalize on the opportunity afforded
        by our new facility. Along these lines, we will hire a full time Home Group
        Supervisor/Incorporator to help the many new people find groups and to oversee new groups
        next year.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We expect another strong flow of new Servant Team members this year to build on an
    already strong core in the church. </p>
    <p>On Wednesday nights from 7:00 till 7:25, we will begin a Corporate Worship singing time
    at the Main Campus. This time will give all of us who want to praise God through singing
    an additional opportunity to do so. It will also be a great way for Wednesday course
    students to start their evenings.</p>
    <p>Besides offering support to our own members, we will develop new inroads into our
    community by publicizing the <i>DivorceCare </i>series, and &quot;SPEC'L&quot; (for single
    parents).</p>
    <p>We hope to build on the successful parent/child breakfast Bible study concept by doing
    more events this year. This will help parents build better spiritual and relational bonds
    with their children.</p>
    <p>We will also continue to hold events in which people from all around the fellowship can
    mix and meet other people, namely, the cinema review nights, and the coffee house nights
    at the Study Center. <dir>

    <b><p>Jim Leffel, Coordinator</p>
    <p>SUMMARY OF 1997</p>
    </b></font><p>1997 was an exciting year for the Equipping Division. We met our goal of
    1400 annual registrants and 6 course offerings per quarter in the adult education program.
    We currently have our largest Christian Principles class ever of 140, up from the 110
    we&#146;ve averaged over the previous two years. This is a sign of spiritual vitality for
    Xenos, as many of these young Christians will become active contributors to ministry teams
    and members of the Servant Team. Enrollment in Challenge Groups remains high this year
    with over half of the Servant Team now involved.</p>
    <p>The Study Center has settled into our new facility. Along with an extraordinary view of
    our property, new furniture and a cozy fireplace, we also have greatly enhanced tools for
    study. Three Pentium computers, loaded with state-of-the-art Bible study programs, access
    the Internet and Windows 95 make the Study Center a complete resource for individual and
    group study. We are concerned about low levels of use over the past couple of years. There
    will be some changes in 1998 that we hope will facilitate greater use of these fantastic
    resources.</p>
    <p>Ministry NetWorking launched another successful ministry fair this year. It was very
    well received, both by the ministry teams that had a booth and by the hundreds of people
    who showed up to see the broad range of ministries Xenos is involved in.</p>
    <p>The Crossroads Project, Xenos&#146; apologetics ministry, had a very busy year. We held
    a &quot;Death of Truth&quot; conference in Denver and had a number of articles published
    in Christian magazines and journals. The Summer Evangelism Institute exceeded our
    expectations. Over 1,000 people participated in the 9 day program that featured two
    prominent Christian apologists, William Lane Craig and Grant Osborne. </p>
    <font SIZE="2"><p><b>1998 PRIMARY GOALS</b></p>
    </font><p>In 1998, the Equipping Division will build on the programs and services
    developed over the past few years. The adult education department is offering new courses
    to supplement the existing array of options and has set a goal of 1600 registrants for
    classes. We are pleased by the quality of our instructional staff, including all of the
    elders and many key leaders. Patrice McCormac offers the Christian Principles course on
    Friday mornings and there are two sections of the course on Wednesday night. We have
    launched a new program to provide high level biblical and theological training for key
    leaders and teachers. This intensive seminary level program offers an alternative to
    leaving church-based ministry and fellowship to attend seminary.</p>
    <p>The Study Center has set an ambitious 200 member growth for 1997. With the substantial
    support given to the Study Center by the Fiscal Support Team, we believe that the location
    and enhanced resources will be increasingly attractive to Xenos members. We are also
    putting some new programs in place that should attract interest both from within the
    fellowship and in the local Christian community.</p>
    <p>Ministry NetWorking will undergo some changes in keeping with Xenos&#146; changing
    needs. Director Mike Sullivan will provide web site services to ministry teams, organize
    two ministry fairs and will reinstate the personal consultation service for those who
    complete the NetWorking seminar.</p>
    <p>The Crossroads Project will promote a speakers&#146; bureau consisting of <i>Death of
    Truth</i> contributors as an alternative to the more costly &quot;Death of Truth&quot;
    conference. We continue to do research and develop new materials that are designed to help
    Christians more effectively communicate biblical Christianity to a postmodern culture. The
    Summer Evangelism Institute will be a 4-day event this year. We are excited to welcome
    J.P. Moreland and Walter Bradley, two outstanding Christian scholars and evangelists, as
    guest lecturers. <dir>

      facilitating the equipping of the Christian community beyond Xenos by providing
      promotional and logistical support to Xenos equipping projects, by managing our World Wide
      Web sites, and by cooperating with other Christian organizations in their ministries when
      requested.</p>
    </font></dir><font SIZE="2">
    <b><p>Doug Patch, Coordinator</p>
    <p>SUMMARY OF 1997</p>
    </b></font><p>We learned a lot this year through the work of External Relations. God
    affirmed the value of Xenos' contributions to the greater Christian community, but
    simultaneously, we believe he pointed us toward more focus on developing our ministries
    here at home. As a result, we have re-structured the administration of Xenos that includes
    reducing External Relations to a department within the Evangelism division, and we have
    eliminated the large out-of-town conferences we had been hosting. We continue to make new
    friends in the Christian community nationally and distribute our books and tapes at a rate
    that is difficult to keep up with!</p>
    <p>We set an aggressive goal of doubling the 1996 sales of Xenos authored books and
    audiotapes (other than <i>Death of Truth</i>), and we met our goal. Many people
    contributed ideas and materials that helped achieve this goal. We thank the efficient work
    of Heidi Ann Klingler and a key volunteer, Carolyn Voelker (in charge of inventory), in
    keeping the order process flowing. Andy Ault has worked arduously on the database to
    improve this process.</p>
    <p>The goal of three out of town <i>Death of Truth </i>conferences, with attendance
    averaging 200 registrants, was partially achieved. Denver had over 230 registrants and
    Lincoln, Illinois over 100 registrants&#151;plus an additional 400 students attended.
    Although people are awakened to the dangers of postmodernism, we are uncertain that the
    investment of money and time into these conferences is adequately offset by the fruit
    born. Coupling that tension with the obvious increased fruit here on the home-front and
    need to enhance our church's missions initiative, the elders think God is probably
    pointing us toward heavier investment here in Columbus and less with other organizations.</p>
    <p>We exceeded our goal of a 20% increase in attendance while providing logistical and
    promotional support to Crossroads' <i>Summer Evangelism Institute</i>. Attendance grew by
    25% with 742 registrants. The number of out-of-town attendees approximately doubled to
    over 120. Heidi Ann Klingler, and key volunteers including Carolyn Voelker and Carla
    Schoenleb (over 190 volunteers total) collaborated to provide smooth logistics. Thanks to
    all contributors to the building fund for providing a superior environment for this
    conference.</p>
    <p>Our World Wide Web sites expanded to include a site for the high-school
    group&#151;written primarily by students. The number of people accessing the sites has
    increased steadily. Last year in November our site was &quot;hit&quot; an average of 1,729
    daily. This year the November daily average was more than double of that at 3,708! In
    addition, we have state of the art shopping capabilities for the outside world with
    encryption available for secure purchases. Web sales continue to grow, although the
    majority of our materials are free. Churches and Christian organizations continue to be
    amazed at the breadth and depth of the materials that we freely share. Jay Reilly, with
    the help of volunteers, has managed and modified these sites regularly.</p>
    <p>Our newest initiative provided a promotional plan, materials, and the leg-work behind
    the Real Life program, administrated by Student Ministries. This program recruits college
    students who are Christians, but not members of Xenos, to attend Ohio State or Columbus
    State. Simultaneously, we train them in the key Christian ministries of evangelism and
    discipleship. Essentially, we work with them in the same way we have worked with our own
    students in Xenos for the past two and one-half decades. Kamie Dixon and Jay Reilly worked
    with Tom Mack who provided the key elements of design of the brochure (all on a voluntary
    basis). They also worked in collaboration with Horizons Video to produce the promotional
    video. They, and Jeff Gabriel, have been traveling around the state through October and
    November, meeting with Christian high school students and organizations to promote this
    program. We contacted every Christian high school in Ohio by phone, and we visited about
    18 of the most interested schools. Over 90 students have expressed interest in our
    program, and we will personally follow up on them in the next couple of months. Most of
    these students are just now starting to make college decisions. Let's pray that God shows
    us whether he wants this program to move forward by bringing us the first students for the
    fall of 1998. <dir>

    <p>1998 PRIMARY GOALS</p>
    </b></font><p>We have always planned to transition from the time-intensive out-of-town
    exposure to a more home-based sharing of our ministries. 1998 is the year that transition
    takes hold. External Relations has been reduced from a division to a department
    commensurate with the elimination of its out-of-town conference promotions and management.
    Jay Reilly has been promoted to director of this department.</p>
    <p>During 1998 we would like to grow to 2,000 total adult attendance at the three Sunday
    Central Teachings. We have reached over 1,800 attendance several times since the Grand
    Opening. With the evangelistic fervor our church (you!) is showing, this is very
    attainable. Our evangelistic ministry teams should grow to about 276 total adult
    attendance, up from the present 216. To accomplish these goals, the Fiscal Support Team
    voted in a full-time Central Teaching director and a part time administrator of the
    burgeoning Playgroup Network&#151;one of our key pre-evangelistic ministries. With these
    new hires, we will be able to spend more time properly following up the people God is
    bringing, and continue to offer events and creative projects which will fuel the great
    outreach our church is doing.</p>
    <p>Two baptisms instead of one will greatly alleviate the crowded conditions at Riverby
    Park and draw more attention to and motivation for evangelism. Set your calendars today
    for June 12<sup>th</sup> and August 14<sup>th</sup>. </p>
    <p>The Evangelism division will work cooperatively with the Pastoral division to enhance
    the process of welcoming and helping new people get connected with home groups. We will
    remain strong in our emphasis on raising up new leaders and planting new groups.</p>
    <p>The External Relations department will embark on a heavy task of &quot;gardening&quot;
    our web sites to ensure up-to-date information and a graphically appealing look. We have
    shortened the newly named <i>Xenos Summer Institute</i> to four days in response to the
    many requests for a more compact conference. We are hoping for a greatly increased
    participation in this conference, both from outside churches as well as our own.</p>
    <p>External Relations will continue their efforts in promoting the Real Life program,
    sales and promotions of Xenos materials through the world wide web and our direct mail
    catalog. We will also expand the tape series available to the public. <dir>

    <p>SUMMARY OF 1997</p>
    </b></font><p>1997 was primarily focused on the completion and occupation of our Main
    Campus facility. It was great to have the Office &amp; Study Center as the &quot;nerve
    center&quot; for planning and implementation of our building goals. Several individuals
    within the Operations division, spent over half of each day on issues related to our
    building projects. The year also saw the successful culmination of our sale of property to
    The Home Depot, which brought in $1 million in cash, along with almost $1 million in
    required roadway improvements. God was certainly at work enabling us to make some great
    strides this year against what seemed to us to be insurmountable goals.</p>
    <p>Operation&#146;s Facilities department oversaw the challenges of managing our new
    facilities and working to transition us out of the old &quot;warehouse.&quot; At the same
    time, we worked daily with our contractor to complete our meeting and classroom space,
    which opened August 31. This critical department ended the year split into two
    departments&#151;Facilities Usage, under John Circle, and Facilities Maintenance, with a
    newly hired director, Dave Bucklew. The year also saw the start-up of several volunteer
    functions&#151;working on cleaning, landscaping and maintenance.</p>
    <p>Our Technical Services department (Sound &amp; Light) implemented an extensive design
    for new systems at the Main Campus facility. Mark Grover was charged with the consuming
    tasks of designing sound and stage systems, and then installing those systems. Mark also
    oversaw the very difficult task of keeping our old meeting spaces providing adequate
    support during our transition. Some hurdles remain with the overall sound balancing and
    acoustics of the main auditorium, but the pieces are in place to make our space a premier
    stage venue.</p>
    <p>Our offices became a place that facilitated many ministries with an increasing level of
    productivity. Cathy Kaiser moved to full-time as our office manager, and oversaw the task
    of providing a hospitable focal point for visitors and volunteers. We are poised to
    provide even better support to the members of the church and our staff, with improvements
    to equipment along with more standardized procedures and policies.</p>
    <p>Media &amp; Graphics continued to provide excellent communication media within the
    church, primarily through the &quot;Weekly Update&quot; and the &quot;Exchange.&quot;
    Chris Lang developed our new Xenos brochure&#151;a daunting task requiring the patience
    and perseverance to work through many diverse opinions and options to develop a piece that
    tries to capture reflects all (at least most) of what our church is.</p>
    <p>1997 was the first full year in which the Xenos database was fully converted to a
    long-term, maintainable hardware and software network platform. We rely heavily on the
    reporting provided through our information systems. Our Information Services director,
    Andy Ault, faced many challenges in making the tools we have work to their full potential,
    and we leave the year on a very solid basis for the coming years.</p>
    <p>The Finance and Accounting Department, headed by our controller, Alan Burkholder,
    continued the job of maintaining our church&#146;s financial resources and safe-guarding
    our growing assets. The financing arrangements for our new facilities required extensive
    attention. We had an excellent year of giving to both the general fund and our building
    fund. As our ministries and staff continue to grow, we have ever increasing needs for the
    professional management provided by Alan and his staff.</p>
    <font SIZE="2"><b><p>1998 PRIMARY GOALS</p>
    </b></font><p>The coming year for the Operations Division will be the first one in 3 years
    not consumed by our building related projects. Operations is responsible for providing a
    productive working environment for our staff and volunteers. Our overarching goal will be,
    simply, to <i>facilitate ministry within the church</i>. We will gauge our success in this
    endeavor by the feedback we receive from staff and our members.</p>
    <p>The new structure in the oversight of our facilities is designed to maintain the high
    levels of service we need with the growth we are experiencing now and expected in the
    future. We will now have one contact point for all users of all of our facilities, John
    Circle. All maintenance, cleaning, set-up functions and management of our building service
    contracts will be the responsibility of Dave Bucklew. This approach will simplify things
    for all of our facility users. We will implement systems and policies to ensure that
    facility requests are addressed efficiently and consistently. We will be praying for God
    to bring forward servants who will work diligently on our maintenance, landscaping and
    cleaning teams, so we can have fully accredited ministry teams working on these areas in
    1998.</p>
    <p>1998 will be a time of stabilizing and augmenting our installed Main Campus systems. We
    want to provide enhanced sound, lighting and stage support. We will bring in some
    specialized technical expertise early in the year to work with Mark Grover on plans to be
    implemented during the year.</p>
    <p>Our office staff will focus on the development of better procedures for providing
    support to staff and volunteers. We will also hire an administrative assistant for the
    Operations division who will support Cathy Kaiser.</p>
    <p>Additional staffing in our Information Systems department will allow Andy Ault to
    implement database reporting to support each of our division&#146;s expanding needs. We
    will also implement software systems to support operating goals for our facilities and
    assets. Of course, we will also support the inevitable unforeseen projects that always
    arise during the year.</p>
        <p>Our Media &amp; Graphics department will focus on completing a Xenos 
          &quot;Welcome&quot; package in 1998. This package will allow us to customize 
          materials about our church for any audience interested in knowing more 
          about our ministries. We will also work hard this year to lay the groundwork 
          for translations of the book <i>Christianity: the Faith that Makes Sense 
          </i>into two different languages, for use in key missions fields. Chris 
          will also continue to oversee the installation of our new building signs, 
          early in the year. Finally, we will add new part-time staff to develop 
        videos for our Central Teachings.</p>
    <p>Our Finance and Accounting department will be challenged to provide the same excellent
    service as we expand ministry in 1998. More funding and activity will create opportunities
    for Alan Burkholder and his staff to review and modify policies and procedures to ensure
    they best fit our operating practices. At the same time, our management will require
    enhanced and more timely financial reporting to run the church effectively, and we will
    look to technology to help us find some answers in this area.</p>
    <p>The senior elders should have more time this year to provide strategic planning to our
    division coordinators, and we hope to provide better communication and implementation
    support to the management team. We will also bring in a consultant to look at our human
    resources practices and provide a plan for improving our oversight in this area. <dir>

      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>The Fiscal Support Team retreat in December 1997 was an invigorating and exciting time
    of realizing what God is doing through Xenos. This year has been exciting, fully meeting
    and exceeding our expectations in almost every area. The coming year may be better yet! </p>
    <p>Already, the elders and leaders of the church are planning for a further massive
    expansion of <img SRC="../../graphics/97arpsite.gif" WIDTH="495" HEIGHT="328"></p>
    <p>our facilities, which may be completed as soon as five years from now if conditions are
    right. </p>
    <p>But before we can make such a move, we must double most ministries and satisfy
    ourselves that the church is healthy, stable, and balanced. If completed, the next phase
    of development would make the Xenos site into a regional center of Christian learning.
    Whether this next step in our ministry takes 5 years or 10 is not important as far as the
    elders are concerned. Naturally, we would prefer 5, but we think it much more important to
    ascertain that Xenos remains faithful to the full vision for church life that has so
    blessed us in the past. The fact that hundreds and even thousands of new people are
    joining us for meetings is good, but are they buying into our vision of the church just as
    much as those who have been here longer? We must be certain on this question.</p>
    <p>Pray that God will continue to choose us to carry out his mission through Xenos.
    Continue to contribute your own unique gifts. Continue to thank him for his faithfulness!</p>
